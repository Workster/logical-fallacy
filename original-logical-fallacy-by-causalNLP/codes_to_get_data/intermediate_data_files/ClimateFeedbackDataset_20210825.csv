CO2 coalition sponsored article in The Washington Times presents list of false and misleading statements about the impacts of CO2 and climate change,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/gregory-wrightstone-article-in-the-washington-times-presents-list-of-false-and-misleading-statements-about-the-impacts-of-co2-and-climate-change-co2-coalition/,There is no climate emergency,https://www.wsj.com/articles/unsettled-review-theconsensus-on-climate-11619383653,"The science and data strongly support that our planet’s ecosystems are thriving and that humanity is benefiting from modestly increasing temperature and an increase in carbon dioxide. These facts refute the claim that Earth is spiraling into one man-made climate catastrophe after another.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is portrayed as a demon molecule fueling run-away greenhouse warming. If you get your news only from mainstream media, you would likely believe that CO2 levels are dangerously high and unprecedented. You would be wrong. Concentrations of this gas are slightly less than 420 parts-per-million (ppm), or one-sixth the average historic levels of 2,600 ppm for the last 600 million years.

Increases in carbon dioxide in the last 150 years, largely from the burning of fossil fuels, have reversed a dangerous downward trend in the gas’ concentration. During the last glacial period, concentrations nearly reached the “line of death” at 150 parts per million, below which plants die. Viewed in the long-term geologic context, we are actually CO2 impoverished.

The most recent claim from the purveyors of climate catastrophe is that recent temperature increases are “unusual and unprecedented.” However, records indicate that modern warming began more than 300 years ago in the depths of the horrific Little Ice Age. The first 250 years of that warming preceded 20th century CO2 increases and were necessarily 100% naturally driven.

Context is important when reviewing climate and temperature data. Assertions that the last month or year or decade were the “hottest on record” can be true only if your “record” is limited to 150 years or so.

Longer-term data reveal multiple warming periods since the end of the last major ice age 10,000 years ago, each warmer than today. There is a strong correlation between the rise and fall of temperature and the ebb and flow of civilizations. During the last three warm periods dating back 6,000 years to the advent of the first great civilizations, humanity prospered and great empires arose. Intervening cold periods brought crop failure, famine, and mass depopulation. History advises us to welcome warmth and fear cold.

Modestly warming temperature and increasing carbon dioxide lead to longer growing seasons and more productive harvests. The world’s remarkable ability to increase food production year after year is attributable to mechanization, agricultural innovation, CO2 fertilization, and warmer weather. Crop and food production has seen only positive effects from relatively small changes in the global climate.

Contrary to sensational media reports, extreme weather-related deaths in the U.S. have decreased more than 98% over the last 100 years. Twenty times as many people die from cold as from heat, according to a worldwide review of 74 million temperature-related deaths by Dr. Antonio Gasparrini and a team of physicians. Global warming saves lives.

On nearly every key topic, evidence presented in voluminous peer-reviewed studies shows that the “consensus” opinion promoted by climate-apocalypse alarmists is consistently at odds with reality. Rather than a world declining into an inescapable man-made climate hell, Earth’s ecosystems and inhabitants are thriving because of increasing CO2 and rising temperatures not in spite of them.

During this period of increasing CO2 and slight warming, we have seen increasing food production, soil moisture, crop growth, and a “greening” of the Earth. All the while droughts, forest fires, heat waves, and temperature-related deaths have declined substantially. Only the radical worldview of environmental extremists could ignore the benefits of atmospheric changes while embracing harmful economic policies based on failed climate models.

Yes, there is such a thing as the greenhouse effect. Yes, there has been some warming, but it has been minuscule compared to the temperature change all of us experience in the course of a day. Some part of this warming may well have been human-caused. These are matters of widespread agreement. What changes the future holds are hardly certain, but judging from the past, they too will be small.

But no, past and possible future warming does not mean that catastrophe will follow, or that measures to prevent global warming are scientifically and economically justified, or that the American values of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness should be blamed for the supposed “crisis”—still less that they should be destroyed because of highly questionable science.",very_low,"Flawed reasoning, Misleading",582,"In April 2021, Gregory Wrightstone published a “sponsored” article in The Washington Times titled “There is no climate emergency”. Scientists who evaluated the article found that it included numerous false and misleading claims about the impacts of CO2 and climate change.

For instance, Wrightstone claims that “our planet’s ecosystems are thriving and that humanity is benefiting” from increases in CO2 and temperature, which contradicts current scientific evidence. While some ecosystems are positively impacted, others have already been negatively impacted by climate change, such as coral reefs and marine ecosystems[1-4]. Even if ecosystems haven’t been impacted yet, scientists emphasize that climate change can have profound effects on natural ecosystems and humanity if it isn’t mitigated. An IPCC special report also states, “Economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters have increased”[4].

Wrightstone also misleads readers about the impacts of atmospheric CO2 and global temperature by claiming that CO2 levels and temperatures were much higher 600 million years ago than they are today to assert that the Earth is “CO2 impoverished”. This comparison is flawed for several reasons. First, mammals and humans didn’t exist 600 million years ago. As Amber Kerr, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, said below: “During some of that ancient history, continents near the equator were too hot to support life, while tropical vegetation flourished at what is now the poles. It is fallacious to suggest that a near-instant return to these conditions would be anything less than catastrophic for humanity.” Second, this comparison conflates natural drivers with human-caused drivers of CO2 levels and global temperatures increases.

Another misleading claim made by Wrightstone is that extreme weather-related deaths have decreased more than 98% over the past 100 years, citing a study by Antonio Gasparrini and colleagues, published in 2015. As Gasparrini, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, explains below, this refers to cold-related deaths, which don’t offset the increase in heat-related deaths expected due to future global warming[5,6].

Globally, the leading causes of weather-related mortality between 1981 and 2020 are drought, tropical cyclones, heat waves, and floods. When normalized by population, most show no significant or downward trends over time, as described in a previous Climate Feedback review[7]. Furthemore, reductions in extreme weather-related deaths are not primarily attributed to increases in CO2 levels or global temperatures, as implied in the article, but rather improvements in emergency management[8].

Finally, the sponsored article fails to disclose conflicts of interest. As Kerr said to Climate Feedback, “Gregory Wrightstone is a professional in the fossil fuels industry. He works on shale gas and oil in the Appalachian Basin. Although this does not per se refute the arguments in his op-ed, it does raise a red flag.”
",,,,,"Amber Kerr, Researcher, Agricultural Sustainability Institute, University of California, Davis","This op-ed contains so many statements that give readers the wrong impression about the impacts of CO2 and global warming. For example, CO2 levels and temperatures were markedly higher than today’s levels during the part of Earth’s history for which we have geologic proxy measurements. However, it’s also true that during most of that 500 million years, mammals did not even exist, let alone humans. During some of that ancient history, continents near the equator were too hot to support life, while tropical vegetation flourished at what is now the poles. It is fallacious to suggest that a near-instant return to these conditions would be anything less than catastrophic for humanity. This article from NOAA summarizes Earth’s CO2 and climate history for a non-technical audience, and this article provides more detail.

Although much of Wrightstone’s op-ed consists of statements presented in a misleading context (like above), some of it is downright false. For example, Wrightstone states that our current global average temperatures are remarkable “only if your record is limited to the last 150 years or so.” That is not correct. The prevailing understanding in paleoclimatology is that our current global average temperatures are some of the highest since before the last Ice Age more than 12,000 years ago[9]. If current warming trends continued under the RCP8.5 emission scenario, then by mid-next century we would likely achieve temperatures not seen since the early Eocene, more than 50 million years ago (Burke et al., 2018, see Figure 1)[10]. As described in Burke et al. (2018), “Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario, by 2030 CE, future climates most closely resemble Mid-Pliocene climates, and by 2150 CE, they most closely resemble Eocene climates. Under RCP4.5, climate stabilizes at Pliocene-like conditions by 2040 CE. Pliocene-like and Eocene-like climates emerge first in continental interiors and then expand outward.”[10]

Wrightstone confuses correlation with causation when he discusses the fact that over the past century, global agricultural productivity has increased and weather-related deaths have decreased. We cannot thank anthropogenic climate change for this. Rather, better infrastructure and better health care have reduced the number of people who die from environmental factors such as weather. Progress in crop science and technology (as well as unsustainable depletion of the biosphere) have enabled a steady upward trend in crop production, outweighing any marginal effects of CO2 and warming.

Higher CO2 and temperature can aid crop yields in temperate regions, but it comes at the expense of yields in more vulnerable developing tropical regions. It is ethically indefensible that Wrightstone celebrates potential gains for agriculture in the global North while ignoring the numerous studies that describe damages in the global South. For example, Schleussner et al. (2018) conclude that “Even when accounting for the full effects of CO2 fertilisation in crop models, median local tropical yields for wheat and maize are still found to be negatively affected”[11]. They predict that the magnitude of this negative effect will double between 1.5C warming and 2C warming.

The other logical fallacies in Wrightstone’s article are too numerous to list here. Without wanting to resort to ad hominem arguments, I find it difficult to believe that Wrightstone (who works in the fossil fuel industry in the extraction of shale oil and gas) is making these arguments in good faith. Rather, this appears to be an intentionally misleading article assembled by someone who, as a geoscientist, understands the technical details but who is using them to distract and confuse rather than to educate the public.","Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University","This article recycles old tropes such as “it’s been warm before”, “CO2 levels have been higher in the past” (millions of years ago!), “CO2 is plant food”, “warming is good for ecosystems/humans”, “so far impacts are small, so they will remain small”, etc. All these pseudo-arguments have been addressed many times before (see examples here, here, and here). This article is clearly motivated, misleading and biased. It presents some facts that are technically true – e.g., in the context of Earth’s geological history, we are in a cold, low-CO2 period (at least for now!) – but that are irrelevant to the issue of global warming: we care about changes from current conditions, to which human civilization is adapted. The article also contains factually erroneous claims (see annotations below).","Katrin Meissner, Professor, University of New South Wales","This article is an aggregation of false statements. It also includes a few partially right statements, but these are taken out of context and presented in a misleading way. It is written in a provocative and arrogant tone, the argumentation is based on lies.","Francois-Marie Breon, Senior Scientist, Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique","Each paragraph contains at least a misleading statement. Although high CO2 concentration is beneficial to some plant growth, the impact of climate change on the growth is mostly detrimental[12-14]. The increase in crop production is mostly linked to fertilizer and agriculture practices, not to the growth in CO2. In fact, there is evidence that climate change has already had detrimental consequences on food production[14], and this may get worse in the future[12].

Yes, there have been higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere, but this was way before humans appeared on our planet. The current CO2 levels, and the rate of change, are way above what the human race has experienced.

CO2 in the atmosphere is there for a very long time (not each molecule individually but the concentration perturbation). This is what generates an “emergency”, because there is no going back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,“The science and data strongly support that our planet’s ecosystems are thriving and that humanity is benefiting from modestly increasing temperature and an increase in carbon dioxide.” ; “Earth’s ecosystems and inhabitants are thriving because of increasing CO2 and rising temperatures not in spite of them.”,"There is no science nor is there any data that globally support the assertion that ecosystems are thriving or that humanity would benefit from increasing temperature or increasing carbon dioxide. There are literally tens of thousands scientific publications that indicate that ecosystems are increasingly being degraded due to climate change and other impacts[1-4]. Many people have lost their lives during heat waves or climate change caused natural disasters[5,6].","It’s true that vegetation has been increasing globally in the last 40 years (since we have satellite measurements). Models suggest CO2 fertilization is the main contributor to the growth of forests and natural ecosystems[15]. Warming has beneficial effects in high-latitude, temperature-limited regions (e.g., Arctic greening), but opposite in the Tropics. Direct human management (agriculture, afforestation) also plays a role in some regions[15].

However, further warming could start having more negative effects on global vegetation, while the beneficial impacts of CO2 could run into some limitations (e.g., nitrogen limitation)[16].

Note as well that current warming levels already have very noticeable negative impacts on marine ecosystems (i.e., coral reefs)[1-3].",,,“These facts refute the claim that Earth is spiraling into one man-made climate catastrophe after another.”,"There is no claim of any “spiraling”, there is just a very robust assessment that greenhouse gas concentrations are rising, that they cause rapid climate change, and that the societal consequences of these changes (economy, health, etc.) will be disastrous for a large part of the world’s human population in the near future[4-7].",,,,"“Concentrations of this gas are slightly less than 420 parts-per-million (ppm), or one-sixth the average historic levels of 2,600 ppm for the last 600 million years”
",To compare with the last 600 million year average is irrelevant. Levels are unprecedented with respect to the time that humans have lived on Earth.,"This statement is partially correct. The average historic level was not 2600 ppm, but there were periods of times when CO2 was very high, likely as high as 1500-2000ppm. The ecosystems and biogeochemistry were adapted to these conditions, and they looked very different from today. There were no humans, many of the mammals around us did not exist. Not to mention that the sun’s energy output was slightly smaller during that time. Changing the present day world into a “dinosaur world” within a century would not be good news for the ecosystems we depend on, or for us.","This is a silly point. Yes it was hotter, with more CO2, hundreds of millions of years ago, but humans – mammals! – weren’t there. We care about change now. 420ppm is unprecedented in the last million years at least. By the same token one could say that during the last 600 million years the Earth was mostly ice-free (no ice caps) – so we shouldn’t care if the ice caps melt now (i.e., 70 m of sea-level rise).",,"“Increases in carbon dioxide in the last 150 years, largely from the burning of fossil fuels, have reversed a dangerous downward trend in the gas’ concentration. During the last glacial period, concentrations nearly reached the “line of death” at 150 parts per million, below which plants die. Viewed in the long-term geologic context, we are actually CO2 impoverished.”","Plants have adapted to lower CO2 concentrations, for example with the appearance of C4 plants. Also, the CO2 concentrations have varied between similar minima during glacials and maxima during interglacials over the past 800,000 years. All the minima are well above 150 ppm.","The last part is not untrue, but irrelevant. Pre-industrial (around 1800) CO2 was 280ppm. For the last 10,000 years (human civilization) it has been around that value, increasing slightly – not decreasing – until modern emissions began. Even without current CO2 emissions and associated warming, there would be no threat of imminent ice age or very low CO2 conditions.",,,“The first 250 years of that warming preceded 20th century CO2 increases and were necessarily 100% naturally driven.”,"The author makes the frequent mistake of mixing natural variability (the slight warming after the Little Ice Age) and current warming, which is due to greenhouse gas forcing[17]. These processes are well understood by climate scientists. In fact there is no alternative explanation for the recent rapid warming, as described in this Climate Feedback review.",,,,"“Longer-term data reveal multiple warming periods since the end of the last major ice age 10,000 years ago, each warmer than today.”","Following the last ice age (20 thousand years) and deglaciation, current (Holocene) global CO2 and climate conditions were reached around 10 thousand years ago. Global temperatures kept slightly increasing until the Holocene maximum, around 7 thousand years ago, and then slowly decreased, until the abrupt warming of the last 150 years. The recent reconstruction by Kaufman et al. (2020) indicates that “The warmest 200-year-long interval took place around 6500 years ago when global temperature was 0.7 °C (0.3, 1.8) warmer than the 19th Century (median, 5th, 95th percentiles).”

Whether or not we are already there, the fact is that modern warming is going to lead to global climate conditions several times warmer than that (e.g., if we get to +3 or 4°C of global warming).

Furthermore, the phrase “in the past century” is telling nothing since no one familiar with the global record of tropical cyclones would look at data prior to 1980; it is just way too poor to be able to detect trends.",,,,"“There is a strong correlation between the rise and fall of temperature and the ebb and flow of civilizations. During the last three warm periods dating back 6,000 years to the advent of the first great civilizations, humanity prospered and great empires arose. Intervening cold periods brought crop failure, famine, and mass depopulation. History advises us to welcome warmth and fear cold.”","The examples mentioned here are vague, it is unclear which cold periods or which incidents of crop failure, famine, or population loss the author refers to. It is also unclear which “civilizations” the author is referring to.

While it is true that past societies experienced natural climate change, these were regional and smaller in magnitude than present-day global warming. Nevertheless, the climate change during periods, such as the Late Antique Little Ice Age or the Little Ice Age, was profound enough to alter human life. It is, of course, deterministic to argue that the climate was the only factor that brought about crop failure, famine, or population loss. In reality, several factors come together that can then lead to crop failure or famine: for instance, inadequate planning, social upheaval, economic struggles, conflicts with other groups, etc.[19].

Past scholarship has focused a lot on the collapse of societies; however, recent scholarship has discovered that past societies and communities often were resilient in the face of modest climate change. Despite the climatic change, these societies or communities maintained their structure, function, and identity. Some societies adapted to the new, often colder, climatic regime and even managed to exploit the opportunities created by the shift in environmental circumstances[19].

The climate change faced by societies during the Late Antique Little Ice Age or the Little Ice Age was modest compared to the much greater magnitude of climate change that we are facing in the present and future due to the warming that our greenhouse gas emissions are causing. In the present, we are already experiencing what it looks like to live in a warming world – heat waves, rising temperatures on land and in the oceans, wildfires, to mention but a few, have devastating consequences for millions of people around the planet[19].","There is no such “strong correlation”. The rise and fall of social systems is affected by many factors and climate may be one of them. In most cases, there is insufficient evidence to explain the fall of past societies with a single factor. More importantly, none of the past “civilizations” had similarly large global populations and similarly high dependence on stable environmental conditions.

Heat waves are becoming more frequent and more severe in many parts of the world. They even occur in the ocean and are one of the key drivers for the loss of tropical coral reefs.",,,"“Modestly warming temperature and increasing carbon dioxide lead to longer growing seasons and more productive harvests. The world’s remarkable ability to increase food production year after year is attributable to mechanization, agricultural innovation, CO2 fertilization, and warmer weather. Crop and food production has seen only positive effects from relatively small changes in the global climate.”","Plants cannot live on CO2 alone. Those plants that profit from higher CO2 will need more water to maintain their larger growth and to compensate for larger evaporators-transpiration due to increased heat. They will therefore be more vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, and to aridification, which will be one of the consequences of higher CO2 levels in many regions[20]. They will also need more nutrients, which are not necessarily available[21,22]. Other plants do not profit from higher CO2, and their photosynthesis rates have been shown to decrease under higher CO2. More importantly, higher CO2 has been shown to reduce the nutritional quality of some plants we depend on, such as wheat[14].","Modestly warming temperature indeed leads to longer growing seasons and modest warming and increasing carbon dioxide can lead to more productive harvests (depending on the local conditions). However, with global warming, heatwaves and droughts are increasing in frequency and intensity[20]. Increases in extreme weather events can have strong negative effects on crop productivity and are expected to negatively impact food production[23].
Crop and food production as well as human settlements are also threatened by the increasing risk of wildfires due to global warming.","It is complicated to separate all factors contributing to crop yield changes, but there is evidence suggesting that global warming is already negatively impacting global food production, at least in some regions[24]. Note that crop yields respond not only to mean climate, but also to extreme events (e.g., heat waves, droughts) that get more intense and/or frequent with warming[23]. Of course, further warming makes it only more likely that negative impacts will start occurring.",,"“Contrary to sensational media reports, extreme weather-related deaths in the U.S. have decreased more than 98% over the last 100 years. Twenty times as many people die from cold as from heat, according to a worldwide review of 74 million temperature-related deaths by Dr. Antonio Gasparrini and a team of physicians. Global warming saves lives.”","I think Mr. Wrightstone refers to an article I published some time ago, where we showed that indeed cold is currently associated with a much higher mortality[5].

However, this does not mean that the decrease in cold-related deaths expected with the warming of the planet will offset the heat-related increase in the future. Actually, from the evidence we have gathered so far by a follow-up study on an even larger dataset , it seems that this is not true unless in mild warming scenarios that require strict mitigation strategies[6].","This statement is false, based on fatality data from NOAA.","Moot point. The concern about global warming doesn’t stem from the direct impact of atmospheric conditions on human lives or deaths, but rather from its impact on the environmental factors that support society – water resources, natural and cultivated ecosystems, ecosystem services, etc. Note, however, that an increase in humid heat could lead to literally lethal atmospheric conditions during heatwaves in parts of the Tropics under a high-warming scenario.",,"“During this period of increasing CO2 and slight warming, we have seen increasing food production, soil moisture, crop growth, and a “greening” of the Earth. All the while droughts, forest fires, heat waves, and temperature-related deaths have declined substantially.”","Unfortunately, droughts, forest fires and heat waves are increasing world-wide, and so do temperature-related deaths[6,25]. The statements made here are invented by the author and entirely “at odds with reality”.","The earth has indeed been greening in the past decades, and this has been attributed primarily to the increasing CO2 concentrations[26]. Terrestrial ecosystems have sequestered about 30% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and this land sink has retarded climate change[27]. However, as global warming progresses, negative impacts of especially heat and drought are increasing. In fact, we are already seeing the first signs of a decline in the land CO2 sink and increasing extreme heatwaves and droughts seem to be the most important reason[16,28,29].","Droughts and aridification have increased in many regions of the world. For example in Europe and North America[30,31]. Forest fires have increased and now show the fingerprint of global warming, e.g. in Australia[32] and the Arctic. Heat waves have increased in frequency, intensity and duration[33].","I am not aware of any study showing an increase in soil moisture over the last decades (soil moisture is exceedingly difficult to measure globally). Heat waves have demonstrably increased[34]. Global burnt area has decreased globally over the last 20 years, yes (by 25%), but that signal is dominated by agricultural intensification and expansion, which replaces naturally-burning grasslands and savannah, in particular in the Tropics[35]. Some regions clearly show warming-influenced growth in wildfires in natural ecosystems (e.g., Western US, high latitudes).

Changes in drought frequency/intensity are complex and hard to estimate – warming may not cause more droughts but may make existing ones worse. But in any case, the consensus is certainly not that there has been any “substantial decline” in droughts in recent decades.","“Yes, there has been some warming, but it has been minuscule compared to the temperature change all of us experience in the course of a day.”","The overall global warming that has been observed so far is small compared to the diurnal temperature difference we experience every day. But this is also a meaningless statement.

We could take our daily food intake as an example. Most of the minutes of the day we eat nothing. During dinner, we might eat a pizza and drink a beer and therefore absorb 2000 calories within 20 minutes. Our intake throughout the day varies between 0 and 1000 calories per 10 minutes, assuming that our breakfast and lunch is a bit less calorific. Compared to a range between 0 and 1000, 10 calories is nothing – I therefore suggest we should all constantly eat 10 calories every 10 minutes throughout the day, on top of our normal intake, and let’s see what this will do to our health.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wall Street Journal article repeats multiple incorrect and misleading claims made in Steven Koonin’s new book ’Unsettled’,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-article-repeats-multiple-incorrect-and-misleading-claims-made-in-steven-koonins-new-book-unsettled-steven-koonin/,‘Unsettled’ Review: The ‘Consensus’ On Climate,https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/unsettled-review-theconsensus-on-climate-11619383653,"Physicist Steven Koonin kicks the hornet’s nest right out of the gate in “Unsettled.” In the book’s first sentences he asserts that “the Science” about our planet’s climate is anything but “settled.” Mr. Koonin knows well that it is nonetheless a settled subject in the minds of most pundits and politicians and most of the population.
Further proof of the public’s sentiment: Earlier this year the United Nations Development Programme published the mother of all climate surveys, titled “The Peoples’ Climate Vote.” With more than a million respondents from 50 countries, the survey, unsurprisingly, found “64% of people said that climate change was an emergency.”
But science itself is not conducted by polls, regardless of how often we are urged to heed a “scientific consensus” on climate. As the science-trained novelist Michael Crichton summarized in a famous 2003 lecture at Caltech: “If it’s consensus, it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus. Period.” Mr. Koonin says much the same in “Unsettled.”
The book is no polemic. It’s a plea for understanding how scientists extract clarity from complexity. And, as Mr. Koonin makes clear, few areas of science are as complex and multidisciplinary as the planet’s climate.
He begins with a kind of trigger warning for readers who may be shocked by the book’s contradiction of four points of climate orthodoxy: “Heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900” and “the warmest temperatures in the US have not risen in the past fifty years. . . . Humans have had no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past century. . . . Greenland’s ice sheet isn’t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was eighty years ago. . . . The net economic impact of human-induced climate change will be minimal through at least the end of this century.”
But Mr. Koonin is no “climate denier,” to use the concocted phrase used to shut down debate. The word “denier” is of course meant to associate skeptics of climate alarmism with Holocaust deniers. Mr. Koonin finds this label particularly abhorrent, since “the Nazis killed more than two hundred of my relatives in Eastern Europe.” As for “denying,” Mr. Koonin makes it clear, on the book’s first page, that “it’s true that the globe is warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it.” 
The heart of the science debate, however, isn’t about whether the globe is warmer or whether humanity contributed. The important questions are about the magnitude of civilization’s contribution and the speed of changes; and, derivatively, about the urgency and scale of governmental response. Mr. Koonin thinks most readers will be surprised at what the data show. I dare say they will.
As Mr Koonin illustrates, tornado frequency and severity are also not trending up; nor are the number and severity of droughts. The extent of global fires has been trending significantly downward. The rate of sea-level rise has not accelerated. Global crop yields are rising, not falling. And while global atmospheric CO2 levels are obviously higher now than two centuries ago, they’re not at any record planetary high—they’re at a low that has only been seen once before in the past 500 million years.
Mr. Koonin laments the sloppiness of those using local weather “events” to make claims about long-cycle planetary phenomena. He chastises not so much local news media as journalists with prestigious national media who should know better. This attribution error evokes one of Mr. Koonin’s rare rebukes: “Pointing to hurricanes as an example of the ravages of human-caused climate change is at best unconvincing, and at worst plainly dishonest.”
When it comes to the vaunted computer models, Mr. Koonin is persuasively skeptical. It’s a big problem, he says, when models can’t retroactively “predict” events that have already happened. And he notes that some of the “tuning” done to models so that they work better amounts to “cooking the books.” He should know, having written one of the first textbooks on using computers to model physics phenomena.
Mr. Koonin’s science credentials are impeccable—unlike, say, those of one well-known Swedish teenager to whom the media affords great attention on climate matters. He has been a professor of physics at Caltech and served as the top scientist in Barack Obama’s Energy Department. The book is copiously referenced and relies on widely accepted government documents.
Since all the data that Mr. Koonin uses are available to others, he poses the obvious question: “Why haven’t you heard these facts before?” He is cautious, perhaps overly so, in proposing the causes for so much misinformation. He points to such things as incentives to invoke alarm for fundraising purposes and official reports that “mislead by omission.” Many of the primary scientific reports, he observes repeatedly, are factual. Still, “the public gets their climate information almost exclusively from the media; very few people actually read the assessment summaries.”
Mr. Koonin says that he knows he’ll be criticized, even “attacked.” You can’t blame him for taking a few pages to shadow box with his critics. But even if one remains unconvinced by his arguments, the right response is to debate the science. We’ll see if that happens in a world in which politicians assert the science is settled and plan astronomical levels of spending to replace the nation’s massive infrastructures with “green” alternatives. Never have so many spent so much public money on the basis of claims that are so unsettled. The prospects for a reasoned debate are not good. Good luck, Mr. Koonin.
Mr. Mills, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, is the author of “Digital Cathedrals” and a forthcoming book on how the cloud and new technologies will create an economic boom.",very_low,"Inaccurate, Misleading",714,"A Wall Street Journal article published in April 2021 reviews Steven Koonin’s book ‘Unsettled’, which is scheduled to be published in May 2021. In ‘Unsettled’, Koonin, a theoretical physicist and professor at New York University, expresses his views on climate science.
Scientists who reviewed the article found that it builds on a collection of misleading and false claims. For instance, Koonin states that “Greenland’s ice sheet isn’t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was eighty years ago”. Contrary to the claim, scientific studies using airborne and satellite altimetry observations show considerable thinning has occurred along the margin of the Greenland ice sheet since 2003[1]. As explained below by Twila Moon, from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the per year average ice loss during 2003-2010 is roughly 2.5 times higher than during 1900-2003. Furthermore, this melting has generated a measurable sea level rise over the last 20 years[1].

Koonin also claims that “the rate of sea-level rise has not accelerated”. Contrary to the claim, scientific studies show that rates of global sea level rise have changed over time and accelerated, notably since the 1990s, primarily due to glacial ice melting and the expansion of seawater as it warms[2-5] (see a previous Climate Feedback review here). As pointed out by Zeke Hausfather, Director of Climate and Energy at The Breakthrough Institute, sea levels are rising faster now than at any point since records began in the early 1900s (see below for further details).

Moreover, the WSJ article repeats a series of misrepresentations about the expected consequences of climate change using a technique known as a straw man argument, as pointed out below by Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at MIT. For instance, when stating that “tornado frequency and severity are not trending up”, the author of the article presents an assumption that climate change was expected to increase the frequency and severity of tornadoes and then refutes it, however climate science did not forecast that tornadoes should have increased already as a result of climate change to begin with.
In a similar way, the author states that “crop yields are not falling but rising”, but in fact scientists didn’t predict that crop yields would decrease due to climate change[6,7]. The author makes up false predictions about the effects of climate change and then refutes them, which has no argumentative value.

Finally, the article also includes misleading claims from Koonin’s book, notably one about the role of climate change in wildfire trends. Koonin uses the observed decline in global average area burnt to discard the impact of climate change on wildfires. As Hausfather describes below, “he is conflating purposefully set agricultural fires (which are decreasing) with wildfires that are increasing in many regions due to climate change”[8,9]. For example, in the western U.S., human-caused climate change doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984, as shown in the figure below[10]. For further details, see a previous Climate Feedback review here.",,,,,"Zeke Hausfather, Director of Climate and Energy, The Breakthrough Institute","The Wall Street Journal article reviewing Dr. Steven Koonin’s new book is a mix of factually correct, correct but misleading, and inaccurate statements. It seems to be cherry-picking different datasets and factoids to downplay the severity of future climate impacts. For example, while Koonin mentions that global area burned by fires is decreasing, he is conflating purposefully set agricultural fires (which are decreasing) with wildfires that are increasing in many regions due to climate change. Similarly, he highlights one dataset that suggests some ambiguity about whether the rate of sea level rise today exceeds that of the 1940s, while ignoring four other datasets that show clear modern acceleration (see below). Finally, his criticism that climate models have poor skill in “retroactive prediction” ignores the fact that climate models published since the 1970s were quite accurate in projecting the warming that actually occurred in the years after they were published, as we discuss in our recent paper[11].","Daniel Swain, Climate Scientist, University of California, Los Angeles","This book review uncritically regurgitates an assortment of misleading and/or outright false claims that presumably appear in the underlying volume. As has been thoroughly emphasized by scientists here and elsewhere, climate change is clearly increasing the frequency and/or severity of different kinds of extreme weather events in the United States and elsewhere (including heat waves), has indeed resulted in an accelerating rate of sea level rise, and has very large societal and economic implications.","Twila Moon, Research Scientist, University of Colorado, Boulder","Many conclusions highlighted in this article are examples of cherry-picking information and failing to provide the context of change. In other instances, statements are fully wrong and unsupported by scientific research.","Kerry Emanuel, Professor of Atmospheric Science, MIT","Early in the review, the novelist Michael Chrichton is quoted as saying “If it’s consensus, it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus. Period.” But those making policy would be foolish not to go with a scientific consensus; anything else would almost by definition be subjective. What is the point of quoting Chrichton if not to cast doubt on the value of scientific consensus? The existence of a consensus is not at all tantamount to the idea that the “science is settled”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,”Greenland’s ice sheet isn’t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was eighty years ago.”,"This statement is untrue. The per year average ice loss during 2003-2010 is roughly 2.5 times higher than during 1900-2003. This is evident in the following figure from Kjeldsen et al.[1]

If we look in more detail at changes over 1972-2018, we can further see that the ice sheet was mostly in balance (gain about the same amount of snow/ice in winter as is lost in summer) during the 1970s and 1980s[12]. It was only in the mid-1990s that Greenland ice loss began to increase more substantially.

Over the last 20 years, ice loss has been rapid and large, creating measurable sea level rise, which we experience as increases in coastal erosion, flooding, problems with water and sewer systems at the coasts, and saltwater inundation of freshwater sources.",,,,”The rate of sea-level rise has not accelerated.”,"This statement is inaccurate; all observational sea level rise (SLR) datasets show rapid acceleration in recent years, and most now show sea levels rising faster than at any point since records began in the early 1900s.

Reconstructing past changes in global sea levels is far from a simple task. While high-quality satellite measurements with global coverage have been available since the early 1990s, prior to that researchers had to rely on tide gauges scattered around the world.

These tide gauges primarily cover coastal regions, leaving it up to researchers to figure out how best to fill the gaps. Tide gauges are also subject to factors that can complicate the interpretation of local sea level changes, namely subsidence (sinking land) or isostatic rebound (rising land due to melting glaciers). The IPCC 5th Assessment Report featured three estimates of global sea level rise[6]: from Church and White[13], Jevrejeva[14], and Ray and Douglas[15]. Two additional SLR datasets – Hay et al.[16] and Dangendorf et al.[17] – have been published in recent years.

All five of these datasets are shown in the figure 5 below (coloured lines), along with satellite altimeter measurements (in black) after 1993.

Recently, there has been some debate around whether the current rate of SLR exceeds that experienced back in the 1940s. Three of the five datasets (Dangendorf, Hay, and Church and White) suggest that the current rate of sea level rise – as measured by accurate satellite altimeters – is around 50% faster than was experienced in the 1940s. The Ray and Douglas dataset suggests that current rates of SLR measured by satellite altimeters are modestly above the 1940s peak, while one of the five – Jevrejeva – suggests that the current rate of SLR is below that of the 1940s. However, even the authors of the Jevrejeva dataset suggest in their accompanying paper that a longer view of sea level – from 1800 to present – still suggests that “the rate of sea level rise is increasing with time”[14].

There is also evidence of accelerating SLR over the post-1993 period when high-quality satellite altimetry data is available. According to the 2018 State of the Climate report[18], acceleration in SLR during the post-1993 period is around 0.1mm each year; this means that the rate of SLR is increasing by 1mm per year each decade.

For more details, see my discussion of sea level rise acceleration at Carbon Brief.","Satellite measurements, which started in 1993, show a clear acceleration in sea level [19]. Also, if we go further back in time, tide-gauge observations show that sea levels are persistently accelerating since the 1960s[4], and overall, the observed sea-level rise during the 20th century is higher than during any other century over the last 3000 years[20,21].","[Comment from a previous evaluation of a similar claim]
This is literally the opposite of what a growing body of recent evidence has shown. Research actually shows that rates of global sea level rise have accelerated in recent years[19], and estimates regarding the upper end of plausible further sea level rise over the coming century have actually increased considerably as the non-linear contribution by continental ice sheets comes into clearer focus[22]. So, if anything, sea level rise is becoming more of a problem than previously thought.",,”The extent of global fires has been trending significantly downward.”,"This statement is accurate but misleading. The vast majority of fires globally are purposefully set for agricultural clearing, and these have declined in recent years. Conflating all fires with forest and wildfires is not helpful in understanding changing drivers of fire risk.

A 2014 study suggests that in the tropics climate change may have also reduced the area burned over the past 50 years, due, in part, to wetter conditions[23]. However, they find that climate change has likely increased fire risk in the high latitudes and mid-latitudes over recent decades.

Hotter and drier conditions have been a major factor in the increase in areas burned by wildfires in many regions – such as the western US – in recent years. For example Williams et al. (2019) found that in California, “nearly all of the increase in summer forest‐fire area during 1972–2018 was driven by increased VPD [vapor pressure deficit]” driven by climate change[24]. Earlier work by Abatzoglou and Williams (2016) found that fuel aridity – driven by observed warming and drying – was the major driver of enhanced fire activity in the Western US[25].

For more details, see my Carbon Brief analysis of the role of climate change in US wildfires.","[Comment from a previous evaluation of a similar claim]
Overall trends in area burned globally are strongly driven by decreases in intentional agricultural burning in tropical areas, which is not related to climate change. In regions where non-agricultural fires occur naturally (including the western United States[24-26], eastern Australia[27], and the Siberian Arctic[28], there is strong evidence that climate change has already increased the severity and extent of wildfire[29].","[Comment from a previous evaluation of a similar claim]
The observed decline in global average area burned has been misused numerous times to support false claims about the role of climate change in wildfire trends. Climate change as well as human activities affect global fire activity (see here for a summary and update on Doerr and Santin, 2016[8]).
The overall global decrease is mostly driven by less fire in what used to be more extensive savannahs and grasslands and is largely due to the human driven removal of flammable vegetation. In quantitative terms, fire in those grassy ecosystems account for around 70% of the total global area burnt, so the reduction in fire activity here outweighs the increase in burned area that we are seeing in other parts of the world over the last two decades where fires have greater impacts such as Canada, parts of the USA or Siberia.
In other words, where humans have not converted flammable landscapes to less or-non flammable landscapes by removing or changing the vegetation, warming temperatures are, overall, associated with an increase in fire activity. A very thorough global analysis of trends and fire knowledge overall has been made by Bowman et al. in 2020[9].","Fires are local events whose regional patterns of intensity and frequency fit well into risk-based calibrations. They can also be perfect examples of a new troubling tendency in which several types of impacts attributed to climate change show up at the same place at the same time, feeding on each other combining forces to produce still greater extremes – something that long-term trends of one type of climate change impact simply cannot explain.
Take, for example, the 2020 California fire experience. Only three of the state’s largest 20 fires (in terms of acres burned) had burned prior to 2000, but nine of the biggest 10 have occurred since 2012. That is, moving toward the next decade, extreme fires were becoming more likely and more intense. In 2017, 9,270 fires burned a record 1.5 million acres.

The Mendocino Complex fire the next year became the “largest wildfire in California history.” And then came 2020. A new largest fire in California history, the Complex fire, started in August of 2020. Soon after came the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th largest in history. By October 3, these five conflagrations had combined with nearly 8,000 other more “ordinary” fires to kill 31 people and burn more than four-million acres; and, on that day, all five were still burning at the same time.

Why is this happening? It is becoming clear that nature can produce combinations of influences on local environmental conditions. Many of the 2020 fires in California were caused by literally thousands of dry lightning strikes that fed into a witches’ brew of simultaneous conditions that have all been linked to global warming:

the end of a multi-year record drought
all-time record heat punctuated July, August, and much of September
widespread tinderbox stands of dead trees from multi-year and growing infestations of bark beetles
decades of normal warming that had extended the western fire season by some 75 days",”tornado frequency and severity are also not trending up; nor are the number and severity of droughts.”,"Koonin sets up a strawman in claiming that tornado frequency and severity are not trending up. The scientific consensus on this is that we simply do not have the data to determine trends in tornadoes, and what little theoretical work has been done on this suggests that severity might go up and frequency might go down, but again there is no real consensus.","[Comment from a previous evaluation of a similar claim]
There is relatively little evidence in either direction at this point in time regarding global or even regional trends in tornado frequency/intensity. This is largely due to sparse and temporally inhomogeneous historical records in the United States, and virtually non-existent records in other regions. There is some evidence of regional shifts in tornado frequency[30], and perhaps an increase in overall tornado “power” in the United States[31], but in general there is an absence of strong evidence regarding this claim.
Future projections regarding climate change and tornado risk are of somewhat low confidence, but there is evidence that atmospheric environments favorable for severe convective storms (which are the types of storms capable of producing tornadoes) may increase in the future due to climate warming[32,33].","[Comment from a previous evaluation of a similar claim]
It is not clear if climate change will make U.S. tornadoes worse or more frequent. The observational record does not show any significant change in the frequency of U.S. tornadoes in the last 60 years but there is a tendency that more tornadoes occur during big outbreak days[34] and there are spatial shifts in the occurrence of tornadoes[30]. Whether these changes are related to climate change is, however, unclear.",,” the number and severity of droughts are also not trending up.”,"[Comment from a previous evaluation of a similar claim]
Observed spatial trends in global hydroclimate over the past century have been consistent with those expected from human influence in the climate system[35]. In many mid-latitude and subtropical regions, this has indeed included an increase in the frequency/intensity of drought[36,37]–but in other regions (such as the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes), this includes an increase in moisture availability and decrease in drought (as expected from climate model simulations). Therefore, it doesn’t really make sense to make blanket statements regarding overall global drought trends, since only some places are expected to get drier (and others wetter) in a warming climate.",,,,“Humans have had no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past century”,"This statement is flat out wrong. In the first place, the theoretically predicted trends would not have been detectable in the sparse and noisy hurricane record until recently, and in fact they HAVE recently been detected. The most up-to-date research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences demonstrates an increase in the proportion of hurricanes that become major hurricanes (Category 3-5) globally, supporting theoretical predictions that date back to 1987 (see figure below)[38].","[Comment from a previous evaluation of a similar claim]
While there remains no strong evidence for an increase in tropical cyclone (hurricane) frequency on a global basis, there is evidence that the most intense tropical cyclones are indeed becoming stronger in terms of maximum wind speeds and minimum central pressure[38] and are producing more extreme rainfall[39].
In fact, these trends are consistent with predictions regarding tropical cyclone behavior due to global warming: there is a strong expectation that the maximum potential intensity of hurricanes will increase due to rising ocean temperatures, even as the overall frequency of such storms does not change greatly or perhaps even decreases[40].",,,"”Global crop yields are rising, not falling.”","While global crop yields are rising, this does not constitute evidence that climate change is not adversely affecting agriculture. IPCC estimates are that increased heat and drought resulting from anthropogenic warming will slow the rate of yield growth, not reverse it[6]. Given a growing population and rising incomes, this will place increasing strain on the global food supply. A recent paper by Ortiz-Bobea et al. (2021) found that anthropogenic warming since 1961 removed the equivalent of 7 years of productivity growth[7]. The effect is substantially more severe in warmer regions such as Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. Moreover, the authors concluded that “Global agriculture has grown more vulnerable to ongoing climate change”.","This statement implies that people are claiming global crop yields are falling, which is false. it also is a logical fallacy to say that if things aren’t causing a net decrease then it isn’t a concern. One could say the economy is larger than it was 30 years ago, so nothing hurting the economy is a concern. Or global health is better, so a pandemic is no big deal.",,,”The net economic impact of human-induced climate change will be minimal through at least the end of this century.”,"It is impossible to support a statement like this because economic damages are very dependent on unpredictable investments in adaptation and because sectoral coverage of the aggregate economy is woefully incomplete. A much more honest statement should read something like this from the IPCC Fifth Assessment: “there is low to medium confidence in attribution of climate change influence on a few sectors… Risks of global aggregate impacts are moderate for additional warming between 1°C to 2°C compared to 1986–2005… Aggregate economic damages accelerate with increasing temperature (limited evidence, high agreement) but few quantitative estimates have been completed for additional warming around 3°C.”
Since 2014, more comprehensive studies have offered still incomplete portraits of the correlations between distributions of net economic damage (not just fitted values) along alternative global development pathways and increases in global mean temperature[41]. See figure below :",,,,"”while global atmospheric CO2 levels are obviously higher now than two centuries ago, they’re not at any record planetary high—they’re at a low that has only been seen once before in the past 500 million years.”","This statement is incorrect. CO2 levels were lower than today’s at every glacial maximum for the last 800,000 years[42], as revealed by ice core records (see Figure 8 below).

For times before ice cores (>800,000 years) CO2 levels have to be inferred less directly from geochemical or biological proxies. These proxies have larger uncertainties associated with them than direct measurements or ice cores. Still, today’s levels are thought to be similar to those for the Pliocene and late Miocene, 2-10 million years ago. Of course polar ice caps were much smaller and sea levels much higher when CO2 was as high as it is now.

Going farther back atmospheric CO2 concentrations becomes less certain, but probably it was higher than present during much of the long warm period prior to Antarctic glaciation beginning 34 million years ago and going back to the last major ice age in the Carboniferous, about 300 million years ago[43].","This statement is misleading. Yes, atmospheric CO2 levels have been much higher than they are now in the VERY DISTANT geological past. But 500 million years ago the sun was dimmer than today, and high CO2 levels compensated for low irradiance. As the sun has become brighter over the history of our planet, CO2 levels in general have fallen, keeping our planet habitable[44]. So statements like “record planetary high” are meaningless. What’s meaningful is that at over 400 parts per million, the atmosphere today has a carbon dioxide level that Earth hasn’t seen in the last 2-5 million years, and climates at that time were warmer than today, ice sheets were smaller, and sea level was higher. Various scenarios for fossil-fuel burning take us above 1000 ppm in the next several decades, a level not seen for over 50 million years and at a time without ANY significant ice sheets on the planet and a much warmer climate (at least 10°F warmer on a global average).","The fact that CO2 levels have been higher in the past[45] should not be used as evidence that humans are not changing the climate or that we should not be concerned about our near future. Statements like the one above are common for climate skeptics, but they widely miss the mark for two main reasons:

If we continue on our current trajectory, global temperatures will soon reach levels not experienced since the time when ice sheets (like on Antarctica and Greenland) were absent. This was a “very” different Earth, and one humans have no experience living in.

The “rate” of climate change is faster than all documented climate change events in the geologic record. The fastest rates of change that we know about (in thousands of years) are associated with mass extinctions. Our current rate of change is hundreds of years. This is scary and does not bode well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pat Michaels, former president of the American Association of State Climatologists, says, “It's warmed up around one degree Celsius since 1900, and life expectancy DOUBLED … yet [if] that temperature ticks up another half a degree … the entire system crashes? That's the most absurd belief.""

Climatology Professor David Legates adds, “In twelve years it’ll be 12 more years.”

The 3 scientists argue that even if the planet warms by 5 degrees, humans can adjust. We already have. People in Holland did.

Holland is a low-lying country.  Much of it is below sea-level. So many years ago, the Dutch built dikes to prevent flooding. Michaels says, “Are you telling me that the people in Miami are so dumb that they’re just going to sit there and drown?”

“You acknowledge though the water is rising?” asks Stossel.

Legates interjects, “Yes, the water has been rising for approximately 20,000 years.”

Another myth they bust: government action today will save us.

“The Obama’s administration’s model projects that the amount of global warming that would be saved [by the US] going to ZERO emissions tomorrow … would be 14 hundredths of a degree Celsius,” says Michaels.

It wouldn’t stop global warming but: “You’ll sure have an impoverished dark country.” he continues.

“Global warming is why hurricanes are getting worse” and the idea that “carbon dioxide is a pollutant that just does harm” are two other myths the scientists debunk.

Stossel concludes by asking, “Are they right? It’s hard to believe they are when so many serious people are so worried. I wish there were a real debate! Why won’t the other side debate?”",very_low,"Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",301,"The video was published by John Stossel on YouTube in November 2019 and reposted on Facebook in April 2021. The video comments on statements made about climate change by environmental activists and politicians that can be misleading. However, speakers in the video rely on several inaccurate claims and use imprecise language that misleads viewers about the scientific understanding of climate change, according to scientists who reviewed the video.
For instance, the claim that sea levels have been rising for 20,000 years, made by David Legates, a Professor and former assistant secretary of commerce for NOAA nominated by the Trump administration, is imprecise and misleading, as it implies sea levels have continued rising since then and current sea level rise is just a continuation of past natural fluctuations. But the causes of the global warming event that explains sea level rise at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago are different from those that explain sea level rise now. In the last 6,000 years, global sea level was stable (see figure 1 below). Ocean volumes remained nearly constant until an increase in the rate of sea-level rise 100–150 years ago, with no oscillations in global sea level exceeding ∼15–20 cm from 6,000 to 150 years before present[1].

In the video, Patrick Michaels, a former professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia, claims that “hurricanes and other storms” are not “getting worse” and that “there is no relationship between hurricane activity and the surface temperature of the planet”. But what does science tell us about how global warming might affect hurricanes? Research shows that climate scientists don’t necessarily expect an increase in the frequency of all hurricanes with global warming, but instead an increase in hurricane risk. Specifically, scientists expect that “sea level rise accompanying the warming will lead to higher storm inundation levels” and that the global proportion of hurricanes that reach very intense (category 4–5) levels will increase, as described in Knutson et al. (2020)[2,3]. Scientists also expect increased precipitation rates in hurricanes[4].

Kerry Emanuel, Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has extensively studied hurricanes intensity, indicates that indeed “the most up-to-date research…demonstrates an increase in the proportion of hurricanes that become major hurricanes (Category 3-5) globally”[3] (read his full comment below). In the video, Michaels misleads viewers by cherry-picking a single measure of hurricane activity and ignoring the broader corpus of scientific research that demonstrates the expected increase in risks related to hurricanes.

Another claim Stossel makes in the video is that CO2 doesn’t harm or threaten the food supply because it helps plants grow faster and that CO2 “helps feed the world”. This claim also relies on cherry-picking some effects of CO2 on plants, while completely ignoring others. Climate Feedback previously evaluated this claim and found it to be misleading (see here and here). Like other nutrients, CO2 is necessary for plant growth and increased levels of atmospheric CO2 have led to vegetative greening in some regions of the world. However, to assess the overall impact of human CO2 emissions on agriculture, one cannot solely consider the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations on plant growth. Instead, one must evaluate all of the effects of increased CO2 and climate change on plants, since the Earth is not a controlled greenhouse environment.

As explained below by Sara Vicca, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Antwerp, elevated CO2 levels warm the planet, thereby generating a cascade of effects, including altered precipitation patterns and more frequent and intense extreme weather events such as heatwaves and droughts. Climate change can also increase heat stress, water stress, and pest prevalence, which can reduce crop yields[5]. Thus all these effects of climate change threaten global water and food supplies[5-8].

As Patrick Brown, assistant professor at San Jose State University, and Kristie Ebi, professor at the University of Washington, describe below, higher CO2 concentrations also reduce the nutrient density of major cereal crops[5], which runs counter to the simplistic view presented in Stossel’s video that CO2 “helps feed the world” (read on for details).

In the video, Stossel complains that scientists don’t want to debate with him; however, this is not how scientific debate works. Scientific debate doesn’t primarily happen on YouTube videos or social media platforms, or through discussions between scientists and news commentators. Instead, researchers who engage in a scientific debate traditionally do so by submitting articles to academic journals. These articles present the evidence and data they have gathered to support a particular claim. These claims must stand up to scrutiny by other scientists, who evaluate the new evidence in the context of previous studies and can attempt to replicate the work or confirm or reject the results by other means. In contrast, except for rare exceptions, climate contrarian bloggers don’t conduct their own research or submit properly written accounts of their findings to academic journals, eschewing the peer review process.",,,,,"Andrew King, Research fellow, University of Melbourne","This video is misleading in so many ways it’s hard to know where to begin. For a start there’s a repeated assertion that climate “alarmists” won’t enter debate on climate change, but there are many examples of renowned climate scientists such as Gavin Schmidt, Michael Mann and David Karoly entering into debates with climate change denialists. Many scientists have found such debates to be unhelpful as they give the false impression of balance despite there being broad consensus among climate scientists that human greenhouse gas emissions have caused at least 1°C of global warming to date. In these debates, climate denialists recycle the same flawed arguments even though they have been debunked many times (see here).

On the issue of being able to adapt to 5°C of global warming, while humans are resilient to some change, we know that, especially in the developing world, capacity to adapt to climate change is limited. A slew of recent studies has demonstrated that even at 2°C of global warming the impacts of climate change would be pervasive and devastating. Many studies show that severe heatwaves, which already kill many thousands of people in the current climate, would become much more deadly even with relatively little additional global warming, let alone 5°C of warming (for example, Saeed et al. (2021)[9].

In order to adapt to global warming humans require that the planet’s ecosystems also survive, but with only another 1°C of global warming the vast majority of the world’s coral reefs would be damaged beyond recognition[10]. Severe heat-induced bleaching and ocean acidification, both of which are linked to human-induced climate change, are damaging the world’s reefs already[11]. Hundreds of millions of people globally rely on there being healthy coral reefs[12], but even beyond 1.5°C global warming the survival of the world’s reefs is at threat. There are many, many other ways in which going beyond another 1°C of global warming would be extremely damaging, including extreme and continued sea level rise[13], and the increased possibility of triggering major disruptions to the Earth system with irreversible consequences (for example, this Nature article). The notion that society could adapt to, or even thrive, at 5°C of global warming is fanciful.

Misinformation that masks the threats that global climate change poses has the potential to slow down our efforts to tackle this problem. It is vital that society is guided by the science and acts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so future generations don’t pay the price.","Timothy Osborn, Professor, University of East Anglia, and Director of Research, Climatic Research Unit","This video has little scientific credibility. It builds up false strawmen about climate change and then pretends to demolish them with flawed reasoning and cherry-picked statements. Here are some examples:

1. The suggestion that the evidence for climate change is not being debated is false — evidence is continually being weighed up during the research process and in scientific publications and then in scientific assessment processes such as the IPCC.

2. The claim that sea levels have been rising for 20,000 years is false. It is likely that sea levels fell slightly over the last 2,000 years until the last century when they began rising and have recently accelerated. See Barnett et al. (2019)[14].

3. The claim that because Netherlands have reduced coastal flooding means that the world could simply adapt to a global temperature rise of 5 degrees Celsius has no support at all. There is ample evidence for the colossal impacts that such an unprecedented rate of climate change would have and the evidence is that it would be overwhelmingly damaging. The evidence is summarised in the IPCC’s ‘reasons for concern’[15].","Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany","The video is mostly innuendo, tossed together with incorrect and misleading claims and impossible expectations. A clear example of a misleading statement is describing the figure below as “the water has been rising for approximately 20,000 years”, while until recently the sea level in the age we built our infrastructure was remarkably stable (see figure 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Claim: “Even if the planet warmed by 5 degrees, humans can adjust. People in Holland did… Are you telling me that people in Miami are so dumb that they are just going to sit there and drown?” … “the water has been rising for approximately 20,000 years and probably will continue” “but we can adapt, like Holland has.”","[Comment from a previous evaluation of a similar claim]
False. Comparison of long tide gauge records and multi-centennial to millennial scale sea-level reconstructions from the same region indicates that the rate of rise during the instrumental period (since ~1850 CE) was significantly faster than it was during the late Holocene (the 4000–2000 years prior to ~1850 CE). The data demonstrate that an acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise occurred[16].","From approximately 20,000 years ago to approximately 4,000 years ago, there was a very large rise in sea level (approximately 125 meters or 410 feet) that occurred as the Earth emerged from the last glacial maximum (due to orbital changes). The fact that this occurred is largely irrelevant to the question of how much disruption multi-meter sea level rise (See figure below from Oppenheimer et al., 2019)[17] over the next several centuries will inflict on our current society.

It is of course the case that various adaptation options are on the table (see figure below from Oppenheimer et al., 2019)[17].

The appropriate question is whether it costs more (in the broadest sense of the word cost) to reduce CO2 emissions or by continuing to emit indefinitely and choosing only adaptation. There are sufficient fossil fuels available to completely melt the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets and raise global sea levels approximately 60 meters or 200 feet[18]. This would represent an astronomical cost much larger than the cost to transition to a near-zero emissions energy system[19]. Thus, relying 100% on adaptation fails the cost-benefit test in the long term.",,,"Claim: “the alarmists say hurricanes and other storms are getting worse. No they aren’t. You can take a look at all the hurricanes around the planet, we can see them since 1970 thanks to global satellite coverage and we can measure their power and we can add up their power. And there is no significant increase whatsoever. There is no relationship between hurricane activity and the surface temperature of the planet.”","The most up-to-date research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences demonstrates an increase in the proportion of hurricanes that become major hurricanes (Category 3-5) globally, supporting theoretical predictions that date back to 1987 (see figure below)[3].

As explained in a previous review, the latest consensus papers published in 2019 by Knutson et al. show a strong consensus that tropical cyclones will become more intense (but not necessarily more frequent) as the climate warms[2]. There is also a unanimous consensus that tropical cyclones will produce more rain, and in places with sufficient rain measurements, there is strong evidence for heavier rain events[2].","While there are no substantial trends in the global frequency of total hurricanes, major hurricanes or accumulated cyclone energy over the past few decades[20], it would be premature to say that there is no relationship between global mean surface temperature and global hurricane activity (broadly defined). For instance, know that there is a stronger relationship between surface temperature and hurricane rain rates than there is between surface temperature and hurricane wind speeds.

The IPCC 2019 summarizes hurricane (or tropical cyclone, TC) projections going forward in the following paragraph: “Tropical cyclones (TCs) projections for the late 21st century are summarised as follows: 1) there is medium confidence that the proportion of TCs that reach Category 4-5 levels will increase, that the average intensity of TCs will increase (by roughly 1-10%, assuming a 2°C global temperature rise), and that average TCs precipitation rates (for a given storm) will increase by at least 7% per degree Celsius of sea surface temperature warming, owing to higher atmospheric water vapour content, 2) there is low confidence in how global TC frequency will change, although most modelling studies project some decrease in global TC frequency and 3) sea level rise will lead to higher storm surge levels for the TCs that do occur, assuming all other factors are unchanged (very high confidence).”[21]",,,Claim: ”The Obama administration’s model projects that the amount of global warming that would be saved if we were going to go to zero emissions tomorrow (which would put us back to the stone age) would be 0.14°C. So no real effect on the climate.”,"This is a number corresponding to the United States acting in isolation. The United States currently represents about 14% of annual new CO2 emissions. So of course, eliminating only that portion of emissions will not solve the problem.

However, if all the governments in the world were to act in coordination to bring emissions down to near zero, then global temperatures will stop increasing. The amount of global warming avoided from going to zero emissions globally (compared to burning all fossil fuels) is closer to 8 degrees Celsius which equates to approximately 22 degrees Fahrenheit over land. So global programs to limit emissions make an enormous difference.

This is exactly why this process is mediated through entities like the United Nations – because it is a collective action problem that requires international cooperation.",,,,"Claim: “The idea of carbon dioxide being pollution that just does harm and threatens the food supply is a myth. If you are really concerned about the plants, more carbon dioxide makes them not just grow faster but also makes them more water efficient. CO2 is a greenhouse gas but it also helps feed the world.”","The claim is misleading. Plants need CO2 to grow and they often grow better when the CO2 concentration increases. However, this fact is often abused to claim that increasing CO2 concentrations is mainly positive, while it also has several adverse effects. Increasing CO2 causes ocean acidification, which negatively affects marine life and threatens to disrupt the marine food web. And of course elevated CO2 warms the planet, thereby generating a cascade of effects from melting of glaciers and sea level rise to altered precipitation patterns and increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves and droughts. These in turn threaten water and food supplies, and as climate change progresses, this is also likely to undo much of the beneficial effect that CO2 has on plant growth[5-8].","It is true that increases in atmospheric CO2 make photosynthesis more efficient and have resulted in ‘greening’ trends observable from space. See, for example, the IPCC statement below[7]. “Globally, greening trends have increased over the last 2-3 decades by 22-33%, particularly over China, India, many parts of Europe, central North America, southeast Brazil and southeast Australia (high confidence). This results from a combination of direct and indirect factors (i.e. CO2, fertilisation, extended growing season, nitrogen deposition […])”

However, this CO2 fertilization effect is just one of a myriad of influences on crop productivity and quality. Global crop models take into account many potential changes (including the fertilization effect from CO2) and tend to indicate that the net effect of increased CO2 (including its climate affects) will cause yields to decrease[5]: “At the global scale, Iizumi et al. (2018) used a counterfactual analysis and found that climate change between 1981 and 2010 has decreased global mean yields of maize, wheat, and soybeans by 4.1, 1.8 and 4.5%, respectively, relative to preindustrial climate, even when CO2 fertilisation and agronomix adjustments are considered.”[22] Also, increased atmospheric CO2 tends to decrease the nutritional quality of crops[5,22].","Higher CO2 concentrations reduce the nutrient density of major cereal crops, including wheat and rice. At CO2 concentrations expected later this century, protein declines about 10%, micronutrients about 5%, and B-vitamins about 30%[23]. This matters because there are more than 2 billion people worldwide with micronutrient deficiencies (Micronutrient Deficiency – Our World in Data). This is significantly higher than the numbers of people who are food insecure. Estimates of the numbers of people potentially affected are in the hundreds of millions.

[The idea that increased CO2 so far is helping feed the world is an exaggeration as explained by Professor Philip Robertson in a previous review:]","In general, CO2 has had a positive effect on crop growth, but it’s impossible to separate historical effects from the greater effects of genetics and nitrogen and other inputs. However, it’s generally considered to be a fraction of those. We know better future effects because we have CO2 fertilization experiments in the field comparing present to future CO2 levels. Those experiments suggest that corn may have about a 1% gain [because of increased CO2] and soybeans 3-4 times that. However, these gains will almost certainly be offset by yield declines associated with the temperature increases caused by elevated CO2, which are well known.

Historically, it’s worth noting that we had elevated CO2 long before we had the green revolution, and crop yields didn’t increase much until the green revolution. You can see this in graphs of average US corn yields from 1900.",Claim: “It is not the case that we “have twelve years to act”,"I agree with the sentiment that there is very weak evidence that crossing 1.5°C represents some unique tipping point into catastrophe.

This claim is made in regards to a 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report[24]. That report was on the impacts associated with global warming of 1.5°C (2.7°F) above preindustrial levels as well as the technical feasibility of limiting global warming to such a level. In 2018, the year 2030 was 12 years away and 2030 was deemed the earliest year in which the 1.5°C threshold could be crossed.

The media coverage of the report did often portray it as saying we have 12 years (until 2030) to act on climate else catastrophe would ensue but the report did not actually make such claims.

The report was not tasked with defining a level of global warming which might be considered to be catastrophic (or any other alarming adjective). Rather, the report was tasked with evaluating the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C (2.7°F) above preindustrial levels, and comparing these to the impacts associated with 2.0°C (3.6°F) above preindustrial levels as well as evaluating the changes to global energy systems that would be necessary in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

To summarize, the IPCC’s literature review found that impacts of global warming at 2.0°C are worse than at 1.5°C[24]. There was no claim by the IPCC that we have 12 years to avoid catastrophe. Therefore, I do not take issue with the Facebook video portraying this framing as a myth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Destruction of the Amazon forest very likely contributes to global warming, as accurately described in The National Geographic article",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/destruction-of-the-amazon-forest-very-likely-contributes-to-global-warming-as-accurately-described-in-the-national-geographic-article/,First study of all Amazon greenhouse gases suggests the damaged forest is now worsening climate change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/amazon-rainforest-now-appears-to-be-contributing-to-climate-change,"The Amazon rainforest is most likely now a net contributor to warming of the planet, according to a first-of-its-kind analysis from more than 30 scientists.

For years, researchers have expressed concern that rising temperatures, drought, and deforestation are reducing the capacity of the world’s largest rainforest to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and help offset emissions from fossil-fuel burning. Recent studies have even suggested that some portions of the tropical landscape already may release more carbon than they store.

But the inhaling and exhaling of CO2 is just one way this damp jungle, the most species-rich on Earth, influences the global climate. Activities in the Amazon, both natural and human-caused, can shift the rainforest’s contribution in significant ways, warming the air directly or releasing other greenhouse gases that do.

Drying wetlands and soil compaction from logging, for example, can increase emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. Land-clearing fires release black carbon, small particles of soot that absorb sunlight and increase warmth. Deforestation can alter rainfall patterns, further drying and heating the forest. Regular flooding and dam-building releases the potent gas methane, as does cattle ranching, one chief reason forests are destroyed. And roughly 3.5 percent of all methane released globally comes naturally from the Amazon’s trees.

Yet no team had ever tried to assess the cumulative impact of these processes, even as the region is being rapidly transformed. The research, supported by the National Geographic Society and published today in Frontiers in Forests and Global Change, estimates that atmospheric warming from all of these sources combined now appears to swamp the forest’s natural cooling effect.

“Cutting the forest is interfering with its carbon uptake; that’s a problem,” says lead author Kristofer Covey, a professor of environmental studies at New York’s Skidmore College. “But when you start to look at these other factors alongside CO2, it gets really hard to see how the net effect isn’t that the Amazon as a whole is really warming global climate.”

The damage can still be reversed, he and his colleagues say. Halting global emissions from coal, oil, and natural gas would help restore balance, but curbing Amazon deforestation is a must, along with reducing dam building and increasing efforts to replant trees. Continuing to clear land at current rates appears certain to make warming worse for the entire world.

“We have this system that we have relied on to counter our mistakes, and we have really exceeded the capacity of that system to provide reliable service,” says co-author Fiona Soper, an assistant professor at McGill University.

A complicated ledger
The same richness that makes the Amazon so wonderfully biodiverse, home to tens of thousands of insects per square mile, makes understanding it extremely hard. Shimmering green leaves suck CO2 from the sky, converting it through photosynthesis into carbohydrates that end up in woody trunks and branches as trees grow. In trees and carbon-rich soils, the Amazon stores the equivalent of four or five years worth of human-made carbon emissions, up to 200 gigatons of carbon.

But the Amazon is also super wet, with floodwaters rising dozens of feet a year across the forest floor. Microbes in those drenched soils make methane, which is 28 to 86 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2. Trees act like smokestacks, channeling that methane to the atmosphere.

Meanwhile, moisture from the Atlantic Ocean that falls as rain gets sucked up by plants, used for photosynthesis, and exhaled by leaves through the same pores that take up CO2. Back in the atmosphere, it falls as rain again.

Humans complicate these natural cycles not just through climate change but through logging, reservoir-building, mining, and agriculture. Deforestation in Brazil has exploded in recent years, hitting a 12-year high in 2020, increasing nearly 10 percent from the year before.

Some of these processes draw down greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, while others cause the gases to rise, and they all influence one another. But until recently, no had attempted to understand that balance. “It’s this system of interacting parts, and they’re all measured in different ways, on different time scales, by different people,” Soper says.


What’s clear is that the forest has been changing fast and in alarming ways. Rain now falls in massive bursts more frequently than it once did, triggering record floods. Droughts come more often and, in some areas, last longer. Trees that fare better in wet places are being outcompeted by tall, drought-tolerant species. Illegally set fires are on the rise again. About 5.4 million acres burned in 2019, an area roughly the size of New Jersey.

So, in 2019, the National Geographic Society brought Covey, Soper, and a team of other Amazon experts together to begin trying to dissect how all of these pieces fit together. They didn’t take new measurements—they looked for new ways to analyze existing data with an eye toward a comprehensive picture.

Looking beyond CO2
While the results include some uncertainty, they make clear that focusing on a single metric—CO2—simply doesn’t paint an accurate picture. “As important as carbon is in the Amazon, it’s not the only thing that’s going on,” says Tom Lovejoy, a senior fellow in biodiversity with the United Nations Foundation, who has worked in the Brazilian Amazon for decades. “The only surprise, if you can call it that, is how much more there is when you add it all up.”

Resource extraction, damming rivers, and the conversion of forest for soybean and livestock production all alter the natural systems in a variety of ways. But most serve to warm the climate. Methane is a particularly important player. While the largest sources of methane are still from natural forest processes, the Amazon’s capacity to take up carbon used to do far more to offset its methane  emissions. Humans have diminished that capacity.

Rob Jackson, an earth systems scientist at Stanford University and a leading expert on global greenhouse emissions, considers the new research a worthwhile contribution. “The Amazon is vulnerable, and we tend to get tunnel vision about one greenhouse gas alone,” he says.


Patrick Megonigal, associate director of research at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, agreed. “What the authors do that’s important is to expand the conversation beyond carbon dioxide, which is what 90 percent of public conversation is centered around,” he says. 

“CO2 is not a lone actor. When you consider the whole cast of other characters, the outlook in the Amazon is that the impacts of human activities will be worse than we realize.”

Many questions remain. The biggest for Megonigal is one that Lovejoy also worries about: How do all of these factors influence the local Amazon climate? That’s important because the Amazon supplies much of its own moisture, with a single water molecule cycling through the forest five or more times as moist air moves from the Atlantic west over the continent.

A recent analysis by Lovejoy and Carlos Nobre, a climate scientist with the University of São Paulo's Institute for Advanced Studies, suggests that rising deforestation might so alter the flow of that moisture that it could push large stretches of the Amazon toward a permanent transition to a drier woodland savanna. The duo believes that tipping point could be reached if as little as 20 to 25 percent of the rainforest is cleared.

That would spell big trouble for the climate, substantially reducing even more the forests’ potential to scrub the skies of some of our fossil-fuel emissions. By the Brazilian government’s own measure, forest clearing already tops 17 percent.

What happens in Brazil (and neighboring countries in the Amazon) affects the whole world. In the United States, a group of environmental leaders from four previous presidential administrations, both Democratic and Republican—Bush senior, Clinton, Bush junior, and Obama—recently called on President Joe Biden to demand that Brazil’s government reduce deforestation. They urged Biden to use trade with the U.S. as leverage.

Brazil and the U.S. are currently in negotiations.",high,"Accurate, Insightful",55,"The National Geographic article discusses findings from a study published in March 2021 by Covey et al. and partly funded by the National Geographic Society[1]. This study assessed the role of the Amazon rainforest in global climate change, taking into account all non-carbon dioxide (CO2) climate drivers, such as methane, nitrogen oxide, black carbon, and evapotranspiration, among others. The article received more than 8,000 interactions on Facebook, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. Scientists who reviewed this article described it as insightful and accurate overall, however, they note a few minor points of confusion and some places that lacked context.
The recent study explored how non-CO2 climate drivers respond to local changes (deforestation, dam construction, and cattle ranching) and global changes (warming and drying of soil, wetlands, and biomass). The authors concluded that current warming from non-CO2 drivers, especially methane and nitrogen oxide, in the Amazon Basin “largely offsets—and most likely exceeds—the climate service provided by atmospheric CO2 uptake”, as accurately described in the National Geographic article. The Amazon rainforest plays a key role in slowing the pace of global warming as it absorbs large quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

However, as David Armstrong McKay noted below, the article’s original headline claimed that the Amazon forest no longer stores carbon, which is inaccurate as the reviewer explains below. The original photo caption also didn’t clarify that greenhouse gas emissions are primarily driven by human disturbance. Both the headline and photo captions were updated to address these issues.

Another minor inaccuracy pointed out by a reviewer is the claim that scientists haven’t studied the balance between carbon storage and loss in the Amazon forest. A previous study, based on satellite measurements, concluded that tropical forests are losing more carbon than they store globally[2].

Finally, as David Armstrong McKay noted below, the article lacks some context by overlooking the scientific debate related to the difficulty of comparing the contributions of short-lived climate forcers, such as methane, and long-lived climate forcers, such as CO2. When calculating the global warming potential of each gas, the overall net effect on climate may be different depending on the time scale considered, as discussed in the study, but not in the article.
The most commonly used averaging period is 100 years, but some prefer to average over a 20 years period, which prioritizes gases with shorter lifetimes. For example methane has a residence time in the atmosphere of about a decade. Its global warming potential is 28 times more than CO2 when its effects are averaged over 100 years, but up to 84 times more when averaged over 20 years.

According to the study, among the 18 emissions scenarios considered, only three showed a cooling effect of the Amazon, whereas the others point to warming of the atmosphere. The cooling effect is obtained only when the global warming potential of non-CO2 gas is calculated over a 100 years time period.",,,,,"Ana Maria Yañez Serrano, Postdoctoral Researcher, Ecological and Forestry Applications Research Center","The article is good overall, although there are two small issues. First, the title seems to overestimate the results. The scientific study the National Geographic article is based on cannot account for all of the climate forcers, as there are no Amazon basin wide estimates (as clearly stated in the study). This drawback could potentially change the overall warming effect, and therefore the title seems to exaggerate. However, it is true that to look at the climatic effect of the Amazonian rain forest, one should not only look at CO2. Second, when the article says the moisture respired by plants falls as rain again, one should say only 50% falls as rain again, according to Zemp et al. (2017)[3]. When the article says: “But until recently, no one had attempted to understand that balance”, I’m not sure if the author is claiming that the study authors are the only ones who assessed this balance, as Scott et al., 2018 conducted the first global approach taking into account Amazonia[4].","Richard Houghton, Senior Scientist Emeritus, Woodwell Climate Research Center","Baccini et al. (2017)[2]. Based on satellite-measurement of carbon stocks, we could already conclude that the forests of Brazil and Latin America were losing more carbon than they were accumulating. However, the Baccini et al. study did not specifically quantify Amazonian forests, and did not consider other greenhouse gases.

The main contribution of this new study is that the forests of the Amazon basin are adding to climate change, not helping to slow it. And the conclusion is based on a comprehensive analysis of several greenhouse gases.","David Armstrong McKay, Researcher, Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University","Overall this is an informative article, for the most part accurately reporting the findings of a recent review[1]. However, the original headline and photo caption (since updated) suggested that the Amazon is “no longer storing carbon for our planet” – which is inaccurate given the 150-200 billion tonnes of carbon the rainforest is still estimated to store and recent observations showing that in most years carbon storage in undisturbed areas is for the moment still growing (Hubau et al., 2020)[5]. The headline and caption also didn’t initially make it clear enough that the higher emissions are primarily driven by human disturbance rather than natural feedbacks to climate change.

The difference between disturbance-driven emissions and natural feedbacks is an important point to be clear on because several steadily worse milestones – a net warming feedback from across the whole Amazon due to direct human disturbances, undisturbed areas transitioning from carbon sinks to sources due to climate change, and a deforestation or warming-induced ‘tipping point’ beyond which a large-scale regime shift to savannah becomes inevitable – are often conflated in popular discussion of climate change and the Amazon rainforest. While this review suggests the former may be close or passed, undisturbed rainforest may take another couple of decades to become a persistent carbon source[5] and the ‘dieback’ tipping point could occur beyond 20-40% deforestation (vs. ~17% now) or ~4°C of global warming[6,7]. If the Amazon had become a net warming forcing, but this was still human-driven, then this means this may still be reversible by mitigating disturbance, whereas a transition to net positive feedbacks from undisturbed rainforest would not be easily reversible.

Although the increased focus on non-carbon dioxide forcings in the Amazon is welcome, it is also not mentioned in this article that part of the reason for the mainstream focus on carbon is that other forcing agents, such as methane, tend to be quite short-lived, reducing their long-term effect and making carbon storage the dominant factor for long-term climate change. There is some debate too over the ideal timescale and accounting method for comparing the contribution of short-lived climate forcers to carbon dioxide, but in contrast to the study, the article does not get into the issue of timescales and how it could affect the study’s conclusion. As a result, the article still lacks some extra context on forcing timescales and why some other climate scientists might disagree with the overall conclusion on this basis.

The updated article does a good job overall though at conveying the uncertainties discussed in the review, making it clear that net warming due to the Amazon is not yet confirmed, and also illustrates the Amazon’s biogeochemical complexity and the many ways it can interact with climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Atlantic ocean circulation system is slowing down, as accurately described in The New York Times article",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/atlantic-ocean-circulation-system-is-slowing-down-as-accurately-described-in-the-new-york-times-article/,"In the Atlantic Ocean, Subtle Shifts Hint at Dramatic Dangers",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/02/climate/atlantic-ocean-climate-change.html,"IT’S ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST RIVERS you will never see, carrying some 30 times more water than all the world’s freshwater rivers combined. In the North Atlantic, one arm of the Gulf Stream breaks toward Iceland, transporting vast amounts of warmth far northward, by one estimate supplying Scandinavia with heat equivalent to 78,000 times its current energy use. Without this current — a heat pump on a planetary scale — scientists believe that great swaths of the world might look quite different.

Now, a spate of studies, including one published last week, suggests this northern portion of the Gulf Stream and the deep ocean currents it’s connected to may be slowing. Pushing the bounds of oceanography, scientists have slung necklace-like sensor arrays across the Atlantic to better understand the complex network of currents that the Gulf Stream belongs to, not only at the surface, but hundreds of feet deep.

“We’re all wishing it’s not true,” Peter de Menocal, a paleoceanographer and president and director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said of the changing ocean currents. “Because if that happens, it’s just a monstrous change.”

The consequences could include faster sea level rise along parts of the Eastern United States and parts of Europe, stronger hurricanes barreling into the Southeastern United States, and perhaps most ominously, reduced rainfall across the Sahel, a semi-arid swath of land running the width of Africa that is already a geopolitical tinderbox.

The scientists’ concern stems from their understanding of thousands of years of the prehistoric climate record. In the past, a great weakening or even shutdown of this arm of the Gulf Stream seems to have triggered rapid changes in temperatures and precipitation patterns around the North Atlantic and beyond.

The northern arm of the Gulf Stream is but one tentacle of a larger, ocean-spanning tangle of currents called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC. Scientists have strong evidence from ice and sediment cores that the AMOC has weakened and shut down before in the past 13,000 years. As a result, mean temperatures in parts of Europe may have rapidly dropped to about 15 degrees Celsius below today’s averages, ushering in arctic like conditions. Parts of northern Africa and northern South America became much drier. Rainfall may even have declined as far away as what is now China. And some of these changes may have occurred in a matter of decades, maybe less.

The AMOC is thus a poster child for the idea of climatic “tipping points” — of hard-to-predict thresholds in Earth’s climate system that, once crossed, have rapid, cascading effects far beyond the corner of the globe where they occur. “It’s a switch,” said Dr. de Menocal, and one that can be thrown quickly.

Which brings us to the cold blob. Almost everywhere around the world, average temperatures are rising — except southeast of Greenland where a large patch of the North Atlantic has become colder in recent years.

In short, the cold blob may signal that the northern arm of the Gulf Stream no longer arrives with the same strength to the North Atlantic. That a warming atmosphere has, paradoxically, cooled one part of the world.

The science remains relatively new, and not everyone agrees the AMOC is actually slowing. But in both scientific modeling of climate change and in the prehistoric record, a North Atlantic cooling presages a shutdown of the current. “One of the hallmarks of a shutdown is this cold blob,” says Dr. de Menocal. “The cold blob is a big deal.”

IN 1513, THE SPANISH EXPLORER Juan Ponce de León noticed something bizarre off the coast of today’s Florida: Relentless currents pushing his ships backward, overpowering the winds blowing them forward. He became the first European to describe the Gulf Stream. Benjamin Franklin finally mapped it in the late 1700s — he named it the “Gulf Stream” — by measuring changes in water temperature on a return trip from England.

Over the 20th century, oceanographers came to realize that the northern branch of the Gulf Stream was part of a gigantic loop of water, with warm surface water flowing north and colder water returning south, deep below the surface. This was the network of currents that scientists now call the AMOC.

The system was driven by North Atlantic water that, as it lost heat to the atmosphere and grew dense, sank to the ocean’s depths, pulling warmer surface water northward. In the middle part of the century, oceanographer Henry Stommel elucidated the physics of how the AMOC could change. His insight was that, depending on the balance of heat and salinity, the sinking effect—called “overturning”—could strengthen, or weaken, or maybe stop completely.

In the 1980s, Wallace Broecker, a geochemist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, pounced on that idea.

Colleagues studying ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet were seeing evidence of strange climatic “flickers” in the past. As Earth warmed from the deep freeze of the last ice age, which peaked around 22,000 years ago, temperatures would rise, then abruptly fall, then rise again just as swiftly. Dr. Broecker theorized this was caused by stops and starts in what he called the ocean’s “great conveyor belt” — the AMOC.

The clearest example began about 12,800 years ago. Glaciers that had once covered much of North America and Europe had retreated considerably, and the world was almost out of the deep freeze. But then, in just a few decades, Greenland and Western Europe plunged back into cold. Temperatures fell by around 10 degrees Celsius, or 18 degrees Fahrenheit, in parts of Greenland. Arctic-like conditions returned to parts of Europe.

The cold snap lasted perhaps 1,300 years — before reversing even more abruptly than it began. Scientists have observed the sudden changes in the pollen deposited at the bottom of European lakes and in changes in ocean sediments near Bermuda.

This forced a paradigm shift in how scientists thought about climate change. Earlier, they had tended to imagine creeping shifts occurring over many millennia. But by the late 1990s, they accepted that abrupt transitions, tipping points, could occur.

This didn’t bode well for humanity’s warming of the atmosphere. Dr. Broecker, who died in 2019, famously warned: “The climate system is an angry beast and we are poking it with sticks.”

WHY DID THE AMOC shut down? A leading theory is that meltwater from retreating glaciers emptied into the North Atlantic or Arctic oceans. Freshwater is lighter than saltwater, and the sudden influx of more buoyant water could have impeded the sinking of denser, saltier water — that critical “overturning” phase of the AMOC.

Today we don’t have massive glacial lakes threatening to disgorge into the North Atlantic. But we do have the Greenland ice sheet, which is melting at the upper end of projections, or about six times faster than in the 1990s. And according to one study, the subpolar North Atlantic recently became less salty than at any time in the past 120 years.

There’s little agreement on cause. Changes in wind patterns or currents may be contributing, as could greater rainfall. But Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer with the University of Potsdam in Germany, suspects that, similar to what happened some 12,800 years ago, meltwater from Greenland is beginning to slow the AMOC.

In 2014, a remarkable project launched in the North Atlantic. An array of sophisticated sensors were moored to the ocean floor between Newfoundland, Greenland and Scotland. They’re starting to provide an unprecedented view of the currents that shape the Atlantic.

In 2015, Dr. Rahmstorf and his colleagues published a seminal paper arguing that the AMOC had weakened by 15 percent in recent decades, a slowdown they said was unprecedented in the past 1,000 years. He and his colleagues recently published another paper that used additional reconstructions of sea temperature around the North Atlantic, some going back 1,600 years, to determine that the recent slowdown began with the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, then accelerated after 1950.

Other scientists have also presented different evidence of a slowdown. The South Atlantic has become saltier in recent decades, according to a study by Chenyu Zhu at Ocean University of China and Zhengyu Liu at Nanjing Normal University, suggesting that more of the salt that once traveled north with the AMOC now remains in the tropics, producing what they call a “salinity pile-up.”

And Christopher Piecuch of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution recently argued that the Gulf Stream along Florida’s coast, also called the Florida current, has weakened. He found this by measuring the differences in sea level across the Gulf Stream. Earth’s rotation deflects flowing water to the right; this causes the two sides of the current to have slightly different sea levels — and the faster the current, the greater the difference. Tide gauge measurements going back 110 years indicate that this contrast has declined, Dr. Piecuch found, particularly in the past two decades. This suggests the current has slowed.

For Dr. Rahmstorf, these lines of evidence bolster the argument that the AMOC is slowing. In his view, the change is occurring right on schedule. “The long-term trend is exactly what was predicted by the models,” he said.

A 2019 report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a synthesis of the most significant climate research worldwide, says that while the AMOC will “very likely” weaken later this century, collapse is “very unlikely.” Yet Dr. Rahmstorf worries about the unknowns in a system that scientists understand can rapidly shift between different states.

He points out that, in IPCC jargon, “very unlikely” translates to a probability of less than 10 percent. But if a nuclear reactor in your neighborhood had a less-than-10-percent likelihood of blowing up, he asked, “would you be reassured?”

“We still don’t know how far away this threshold is where it could break down altogether,” he said. If we limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times — a goal of the Paris agreement among nations to fight climate change — a shutdown is unlikely, he thinks. “But for unmitigated warming,” which is the world’s current trajectory, “I think there’s increasing risk where we make AMOC so weak it goes over the edge and collapses.”

“There will be a lot of surprises if we disturb climate that much,” he said. “It’s not at all predictable how bad things will be.”

Scientists also emphasize that the ultimate consequences of that weakening remain unclear. That’s in part because the world is in such uncharted territory. In the past, Europe became drastically cooler when the current shut down, but today any cooling might ultimately be muted or possibly canceled out by continued global heating.

But if past is prologue, a drastically altered AMOC could certainly shift rainfall patterns, scientists said, making parts of Europe and Northern Africa drier, and areas in the Southern hemisphere wetter. Changing ocean currents might affect marine ecosystems that people rely on for food and livelihood.

A changing Gulf Stream could also accelerate sea-level rise along parts of the Atlantic coast of the United States. In 2009 and 2010, when the stream inexplicably weakened by 30 percent, the Northeast saw seas rise at a rate unprecedented in the entire roughly 100-year record of tide gauges.

And if water in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic becomes warmer because that heat is no longer shunted north, the expanding reservoir of energy could strengthen hurricanes, something that scientists at the National Oceanography Centre in the United Kingdom argue is already happening. Hurricanes derive their energy from heat in the water.

Finally, in a perverse twist, a shutdown of the AMOC could exacerbate global heating. The ocean absorbs nearly one-third of human carbon dioxide emissions. But the sinking of salty, dense water — the overturning portion of the AMOC — is critical to that absorption. So, if the AMOC stops or greatly slows, and that water stops sinking, the accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere could accelerate.

THEN THERE ARE THOSE CONSEQUENCES that fall in the category of “global weirding.”

Scientists at the U.K.’s National Oceanography Centre have somewhat counterintuitively linked the cold blob in the North Atlantic with summer heat waves in Europe. In 2015 and 2018, the jet stream, a river of wind that moves from west to east over temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere, made an unusual detour to the south around the cold blob. The wrinkle in atmospheric flow brought hotter-than-usual air into Europe, they contend, breaking temperature records.

“That was not predicted,” said Joel Hirschi, principal scientist at the centre and senior author of the research. It highlights how current seasonal forecasting models are unable to predict these warm summers. And it underscores the paradox that, far from ushering in a frigid future for, say, Paris, a cooler North Atlantic might actually make France’s summers more like Morocco’s.

Even so, Dr. Hirschi takes a wait-and-see stance on whether the AMOC is actually slowing. “I have great respect for what Dr. Rahmstorf is doing. And it may well be spot on in the end,” he says. “But I’m afraid the data, the really robust data, is not there.”

Susan Lozier, a physical oceanographer and dean at the College of Sciences at Georgia Tech, also has her doubts about whether the AMOC is currently slowing. At issue, she says, is how scientists infer changes in the AMOC. We can directly measure many aspects of the ocean, such as temperature (it’s warming), oxygen levels (they’re declining), even how stratified it has become (more so). “There are very strong signals in the ocean of climate change,” she said.

But most studies on the AMOC don’t measure the “conveyor belt” directly. Instead, they use proxies to infer that the overturning has changed.

Such inference can be problematic when considering changes that occur over short time frames, says Dr. Lozier, because the changes observed could have other causes. Consider that cold blob in the North Atlantic, she said. Dr. Rahmstorf and others see it as evidence of a weakening Gulf Stream, but Dr. Lozier notes that shifts in wind patterns or how storms move over the ocean could also underlie the phenomenon. “There are other ways to explain it,” she said. “A lot of our conceptual understanding of AMOC is in isolation of other things going on in the ocean.”

Direct measurement of the AMOC only began relatively recently. A line of sensors between the Bahamas and the Canary Islands, called Rapid, was installed in 2004. A second sensor array, spanning the North Atlantic from Canada to Greenland to Scotland and called Osnap, went live in 2014. (Dr. Lozier is the international project lead for Osnap.)

Neither project has operated long enough to produce clear trends, in Dr. Lozier’s view. What they have shown, though, is lots of natural variability. In 2009 and 2010, for example, the AMOC weakened — “people were like, ‘Oh my God, this is happening,’” she said — only to pick right back up again over the following years.

They’ve also revealed a system of currents that’s far more complex than once envisioned.

Dr. Broecker’s old schematics of the AMOC posit a neat warm current flowing north along the western edge of the Atlantic and an equally neat cold current flowing back south below it. In fact, says Dr. Lozier, that deeper current is not confined to the western edge of the Atlantic, but rather flows southward via a number of “rivers” that are filled with eddies. The network of deep ocean currents is much more complicated than once envisioned, in other words, and figuring out how buoyant meltwater from Greenland might affect the formation of cold deepwater has become more complicated as well.

This is the place scientists currently find themselves in. They suspect the AMOC can work like a climate switch. They’re watching it closely. Some argue that it’s already changing, others that it’s too soon to tell.

“There’s no consensus on whether it has slowed to date, or if it’s currently slowing,” said Dr. Lozier. “But there is a consensus that if we continue to warm the atmosphere, it will slow.”","very_high, high",Insightful,471,"The article published in The New York Times discusses findings from a study published in February 2021 that reconstructed the evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), an ocean circulation system that strongly influences Earth’s climate[1]. The AMOC redistributes heat on the planet as warm, surface water flows northward and cold, deep water flows southward. The article received more than 60,000 interactions on Facebook, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. Scientists who reviewed the article described it as insightful and accurate overall, however, they note a few minor points of confusion.
The recent study, among others, found that the AMOC started weakening during the 19th century and, in recent decades, reached its weakest state in over a millennium[1]. The slowdown of the AMOC can influence the climate by changing temperature and precipitation patterns, as accurately described in the article.

However, the article conflates the long-term warming hole or “cold blob” with the shorter-term 2015 North Atlantic cold anomaly. As the reviewers explain below, the ‘cold blob’ and the 2015 cold anomaly have different timescales and different underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the “cold blob” may be caused by a weakening of the AMOC, as discussed in the article, whereas the more recent cold anomaly appears to be caused by successive winters with extreme heat loss.

A reviewer also suggested that the article could be more clear about the distinctions between the Gulf Stream and the AMOC. The Gulf Stream refers to a warm, Atlantic ocean current that stretches from the Gulf of Mexico along the eastern U.S. Whereas the AMOC describes a network of currents at the surface, subsurface, and deeper levels of the ocean.",,,,,"Dan Jones, Physical Oceanographer, British Antarctic Survey","This article is well-written, and the visuals are outstanding. It is a very strong piece of science communication. That being said, there is at least one error. The author mistakenly conflates the long-term warming hole with the shorter-term North Atlantic cold anomaly. The two phenomena have very different timescales and are likely driven by different mechanisms. The long-term warming hole that is the focus of the NYT article may have been driven by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) slowdown as discussed, but the 2015 cold anomaly that was linked to European heat waves was a shorter-term phenomena that was likely caused by successive winters with extreme heat loss, as opposed to an AMOC slowdown.

Indeed, in the study by Duchez et al. that was linked to in the NYT article, the authors state “It is important to distinguish between this long-term warming hole and the short term 2015 cold anomaly that is the focus of our study.”[2] Unfortunately, the authors of the NYT article missed this distinction and conflated the two phenomena. To be fair, this is an easy mistake to make! Many of our own colleagues have confused the two phenomena at first glance.

The article has awesome graphics and good selection of quotes, although it would be very nice to have the comments from the lead author of the article (L. Caesar). The article has very good, up-to-date references. Some minor comments:
1) As was already pointed by Dan Jones on twitter, they mixed the decadal-scale cold blob and the short-term subpolar North Atlantic 2015 cold anomaly.
2) In the article sometimes the distinction between the Gulf Stream and AMOC is not very clear. It’s true that sometimes the AMOC is called the Gulf Stream System, but because the AMOC is a network of currents, we should keep in mind that Gulf Stream and AMOC are not synonyms. There are more currents in the AMOC and they are not only in the surface-subsurface layer.","Stefan Rahmstorf, Professor, Potsdam University","The article provides a very good and credible overview of recent scientific findings regarding the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and nicely covers science history all the way back to discoveries in the 16th Century.

One minor comment, it describes our recent study as providing “reconstructions of sea temperature around the North Atlantic, some going back 1,600 years”, whilst what we mostly provided are proxy data series for AMOC strength from the sediments at the bottom of the Atlantic, most of which are unrelated to temperature. But that is just one sentence in an otherwise great article.","Didier Swingedouw, Researcher, CNRS (French National Center for Scientific Research)","Generally speaking, the article is sound and has numerous sources of scientists to equilibrate the debate. There are only a few things that are maybe exaggerated and not clearly explained in my opinion, e.g.: The estimate that the AMOC has weakened by 15% is not in Rahmstorf et al. (2015)[4], but in Caesar et al. (2018)[5]. Also, the sentence “Hurricanes derive their energy from heat in the water” is a bit misleading when referring to mid-latitude storms. The fact that a weakening AMOC might enhance their probability is mainly due to strengthening of equator-pole temperature gradient. Consensus is low on the paper cited in the article. Why not refer to the IPCC chapter 6.7 special report on extremes, abrupt changes, and managing risks in the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate instead to find consensus on potential climatic impacts?[6]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Scientists at the U.K.’s National Oceanography Centre have somewhat counterintuitively linked the cold blob in the North Atlantic with summer heat waves in Europe.

"Breitbart article makes numerous false claims about the impacts of climate change, based on Global Warming Policy Foundation post",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-article-makes-numerous-false-claims-about-the-impacts-of-climate-change-based-on-global-warming-policy-foundation-post-delingpole-goklany/,Study Disputes That Earth Is in a ‘Climate Emergency’,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2021/02/07/delingpole-study-disputes-earth-climate-emergency/,"There is no “climate emergency”, according to a study for the Global Warming Policy Foundation by independent scientist Dr Indur Goklany.

Goklany concludes:

While climate may have changed for the warmer:

• Most extreme weather phenomena have not become more extreme, more deadly, or more destructive

• Empirical evidence directly contradicts claims that increased carbon dioxide has reduced human wellbeing. In fact, human wellbeing has never been higher

• Whatever detrimental effects warming and higher carbon dioxide may have had on terrestrial species and ecosystems, they have been swamped by the contribution of fossil fuels to increased biological productivity. This has halted, and turned around, reductions in habitat loss

The report will make hugely depressing reading for all the prominent environmental activists — from the Pope and Doom Goblin Greta Thunberg to the Great Reset’s Klaus Schwab — who have been pushing the “climate emergency” narrative. It is an article of faith for the globalist elite and their useful idiots in the media, in politics, in business, and the entertainment that the world is on course for climate disaster which only radical and costly international action can prevent.

But Goklany’s report — Impacts of Climate Change: Perception & Reality — claims there is little if any evidence to support the scare narrative.

At the end, Goklany provides a table, setting out all the scaremongering claims made by environmental groups — and then comparing them with observed reality. Only one of the claims stands up, according to the study — weather has been getting slightly warmer:

More hot days and fewer cold days — Yes

Cyclones/hurricanes more intense or frequent — No

Tornadoes increase and become more intense — No

Floods more frequent and more intense — No

Droughts more frequent and intense — No

Area burned by wildfire increasing — No (area peaked in mid-19th century)

Cereal yields decreasing — No (they have tripled since 1961)

Food supplies per capita decreasing — No (increased 31 per cent since 1961)

Land area and beaches shrinking, coral islands submerged — No. (Marginal expansion)

None of the doom-mongering claims made about a decline in human welfare stands up, either, according to the study.

Access to cleaner water has increased; mortality from ‘Extreme Weather Events’ has declined by 99 per cent since the 1920s; fewer people are dying from heat; death rates from climate-sensitive diseases like malaria and diarrhoea have decreased (since 1900 malaria death rates have declined 96 per cent); hunger rates have declined; poverty has declined (GDP per capita has quadrupled since 1950 even as CO2 levels have sextupled); life expectancy has more than doubled since the start of industrialisation; health adjusted life expectancy has increased; global inequality has decreased in terms of incomes, life expectancies and access to modern-day amenities; the earth is green and more productive; habitat lost to agriculture has peaked due to fossil fuel dependent technologies.

It will be hard for green activists to dismiss Goklany as a “denier”. His credentials as a climate expert are impeccable. He was a member of the U.S. delegation that established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and helped develop its First Assessment Report. He subsequently served as a U.S. delegate to the IPCC, and as an IPCC reviewer.

Goklany says:

Almost everywhere you look, climate change is having only small, and often benign, impacts. The impact of extreme weather events ― hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts ― are, if anything, declining. Economic damages have declined as a fraction of global GDP. Death rates from such events have declined by 99% since the 1920s. Climate-related disease has collapsed. And more people die from cold than warm temperatures.

Even sea-level rise — predicted to be the most damaging impact of global warming — seems to be much less of a problem than thought, according to to the study’s findings.

Goklany says:

A recent study showed that the Earth has actually gained more land in coastal areas in the last 30 years than it has lost through sea-level rise. We now know for sure that coral atolls aren’t disappearing and even Bangladesh is gaining more land through siltation than it is losing through rising seas.

In his report, Goklany destroys many of the green movement’s shibboleths, including the notion that fossil fuels are bad for the planet. Not only, he suggests, has their CO2 contributed to “global greening” — “contrary to prevailing wisdom, tree cover globally has increased by over 2 million km2 between 1982 and 2016, an increase of 7 per cent” — but they provide the fertilisers and pesticides which simultaneously feed the planet and reduce the amount of land required for agriculture:

Thus, nitrogen fertilisers and carbon dioxide fertilisation have together increased global food production by 111 per cent. In other words, fossil fuels are responsible for more than half of global food production. Without them, food would be scarcer, and prices higher (assuming all else, including food demand, stays constant). To maintain the food supply, croplands would have to more than double, to at least 26 per cent of the world’s land area (ex-Antarctica). Adding in pastureland, the human footprint on the planet would increase to 51.2 per cent of the world. In other words, fossil fuels have saved 13.8 per cent of the non-frozen parts of the world from being converted to agriculture.

At the beginning, he quotes a number of climate doom-mongers, including the Pope. According to the Pope:

The effects of global inaction are startling…Around the world, we are seeing heat waves, droughts, forest fires, floods and other extreme meteorological events, rising sea levels, emergencies of diseases and further problems that are only premonition of things far worse, unless we act and act urgently.

Maybe it’s time the Pope looked at some actual evidence…",very_low,"Cherry-picking, Inaccurate, Misleading",2307,"The article was published by Breitbart as well as dozens of other blogs, such as Climate Change Dispatch, Principia Scientific, Climate Depot, and Technocracy News. It is repeating a series of claims made in a blog post from the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), a political advocacy organization, which has published misinformation in the past. Scientists who reviewed the article found that it includes several inaccurate claims and cherry-picks information in a way that misleads readers about the scientific understanding of climate change.
Specifically, it states, “Most extreme weather phenomena have not become more extreme, more deadly, or more destructive”. Contrary to this claim, the IPCC reports and numerous scientific studies demonstrated that global warming increases the intensity of many types of extreme weather events, as the scientists explain below[1-6]. In addition, some extreme weather events, such as heat waves and intense rainfall events, are becoming more common and the trend is expected to continue, as described in a previous Climate Feedback review.

The article is built on a series of misrepresentations of the expected consequences of climate change, a technique known as a straw man argument. For instance, the author presents an assumption that climate change will increase drought globally and then refutes this non-existent expectation of climate science. As explained by Dr. Swain below, “it doesn’t really make sense to make blanket statements regarding overall global drought trends, since only some places are expected to get drier (and others wetter) in a warming climate”.

The article also deliberately ignores multiple factors that affect some phenomena to argue against the influence of climate on them. For instance, while fatality due to weather events has either remained constant or declined over time for some types of weather events[7], this is primarily due to improvements in warning and evacuation systems and has little to do with climate change, as the reviewers explain below.

Contrary to the article, climate change has caused some extreme weather events to be more destructive, as scientists explained in a previous review. For example, global warming is causing the oceans to increase in temperature, more moisture in the atmosphere, and sea-level to rise, leading to more extreme precipitation and damage from tropical storms and hurricanes[4,5]. The area burned by wildfires in the western US has also increased significantly due to climate change (see figure below).

The article also makes several misleading claims about the impacts of nitrogen and carbon dioxide fertilization on food production. Carbon dioxide has increased plant growth in some regions of the world, but these effects are often limited by nutrient availability and can saturate over time[9,10]. Global warming is also damaging crop yields and slowing plant growth under some circumstances, and these effects are expected to continue in the future[11-13], as the reviewers explain below.

It is also misleading to call the GWPF post published by Dr. Indur Goklany a “study”, as it does not include any original research nor was it peer-reviewed or published by a reputable scientific organization. Furthermore, Goklany is an electrical engineer, not a climate scientist, who hasn’t published any peer-reviewed research in at least the past decade on the topics he wrote about in the GWFP post.",,,,,"Daniel Swain, Climate Scientist, University of California, Los Angeles","This article uses a single poorly-sourced, non-peer reviewed report as a basis for making numerous misleading and in multiple instances demonstrably false claims regarding climate change and its global implications.","Kerry Emanuel, Professor of Atmospheric Science, MIT","The article is mostly inaccurate and uniformly misleading. For example, in declaring that hurricane frequency is not increasing, it neglects to mention that there was never a consensus prediction that the frequency of all hurricanes would increase, or in stating that weather-related deaths are decreasing fails to mention that the reasons for that have nothing to do with climate change but rather with rapidly improving warnings and preparedness.","Ana Bastos, Group Leader, Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry",This is a biased and purposely misleading article that contradicts evidence-based scientific literature. The authors did not care to cross-check the claims made by Mr. Goklany nor to set them in the broader context of the scientific evidence about climate change and impacts (e.g. IPCC reports)[1].,"Ryan Sriver, Associate Professor, University of Illinois","The article’s scientific credibility is very low. The author cherry-picks data, makes broad generalizations and characterizations based on incomplete or flimsy reasoning, and repeatedly misinterprets technological and economic progress in justifying false claims and misinformation minimizing global warming impacts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,“according to a study for the Global Warming Policy Foundation”,"It is important to note that the purported “study” that is the subject of this article is not actually a study in any meaningful sense of the word. It is written by a single author who is not a physical or climate scientist, contains no previously unpublished data, and has not been peer-reviewed.","This is not a “study”. It is a single-author, non-peer reviewed opinion piece that cherry-picks, misinterprets and conflates previous findings.",,,"“Most extreme weather phenomena have not become more extreme, more deadly, or more destructive.”","There is an extensive and growing body of evidence showing that many kinds of extreme weather have increased in magnitude and/or frequency as the climate has warmed. Evidence is strongest regarding increases in extreme heatwaves and extreme precipitation events[14], but there is also extensive evidence regarding increasing intensity of other physical event types such as droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes (especially in specific regions). Indeed, there is now an entire sub-field of climate science, known as “extreme event attribution,” devoted to understanding how climate change is affecting the occurrence and intensity of extreme weather-related events[15].","Globally, the leading causes of mortality from weather phenomena during the period 1981-2020, in order, are drought, tropical cyclones, heat waves, floods, and convective storms. For most of these, when normalized by population, there are either no significant trends or downward trends[7]. In most, if not all, cases, this is attributable to improved emergency management. For example, there have been large decreases in tropical cyclone fatality thanks to far better warning, more and better evacuations, and in some places like Bangladesh, the massive construction of evacuation shelters[16].

Weather is taking fewer lives, but when one looks at damage the story is quite different. Since the early 1970s there has been a 380% increase in global weather-related damage normalized each year by world domestic product. Some of this is demographic; for example, there has been a 200% increase in coastal population, but much of the rest is owing to worse weather disasters, as measured by damage.

From a strictly meteorological perspective, the latest consensus papers published in 2019 by Knutson et al. show a strong consensus that tropical cyclones will become more intense (but not necessarily more frequent) as the climate warms[4], and a paper published by Kossin in 2020 shows that the fraction of high intensity tropical cyclone observations has been increasing (see figure below)[17].

There is also a unanimous consensus that tropical cyclones will produce more rain, and in places with sufficient rain measurements, there is strong evidence for heavier rain events[4]. There is also strong evidence for an increase in the incidence of drought in some regions[1].

In a nutshell, deaths from extreme weather events are indeed decreasing but this is because of improving warnings, evacuations, and shelters, mostly in the developing world. There is strong evidence that weather events globally are becoming more destructive and more extreme[1].",,,"“Empirical evidence directly contradicts claims that increased carbon dioxide has reduced human wellbeing. In fact, human wellbeing has never been higher”","The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide does not directly affect human health, but it does directly cause increased global temperature and ocean acidification, and both of these are having major detrimental effects on human and ecosystem wellbeing.","Carbon dioxide increase does not directly affect human well being, but the main process responsible for increasing CO2 is also responsible for air pollution that does directly affect human health[18,19].

In addition, many environmental consequences from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and global warming have heavy costs in terms of human lives and life quality, for example heatwaves, famines due to drought, increase/expansion in infectious diseases[20,21].",,,There are “More hot days and fewer cold days”,This is essentially the only scientifically accurate claim I can discern in the entire article.,,,,”Cyclones/hurricanes [are not] more intense or frequent”,"While it is true that there remains no strong evidence for an increase in tropical cyclone (hurricane) frequency on a global basis, there is evidence that the most intense tropical cyclones are indeed becoming stronger (in terms of maximum wind speeds and minimum central pressure[17] and are producing more extreme rainfall[5].

In fact, these trends are consistent with predictions regarding tropical cyclone behavior due to global warming: there is a strong expectation that the maximum potential intensity of hurricanes will increase due to rising ocean temperatures, even as the overall frequency of such storms does not change greatly or perhaps even decreases[4].",,,,“Tornadoes [are not] increas[ing] and becom[ing] more intense”,"There is relatively little evidence in either direction at this point in time regarding global or even regional trends in tornado frequency/intensity. This is largely due to sparse and temporally inhomogeneous historical records in the United States, and virtually non-existent records in other regions. There is some evidence of regional shifts in tornado frequency[22], and perhaps an increase in overall tornado “power” in the United States[23], but in general there is an absence of strong evidence regarding this claim.

Future projections regarding climate change and tornado risk are of somewhat low confidence, but there is evidence that atmospheric environments favorable for severe convective storms (which are the types of storms capable of producing tornadoes) may increase in the future due to climate warming[24,25].",,,,"”Droughts [are not] more frequent and intense”

","Observed spatial trends in global hydroclimate over the past century have been consistent with those expected from human influence in the climate system[26]. In many mid-latitude and subtropical regions, this has indeed included an increase in the frequency/intensity of drought[27,28]–but in other regions (such as the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes), this includes an increase in moisture availability and decrease in drought (as expected from climate model simulations). Therefore, it doesn’t really make sense to make blanket statements regarding overall global drought trends, since only some places are expected to get drier (and others wetter) in a warming climate.",,,,There has been no increase in the area burned by wildfire; the area peaked in the mid-19th century,"This is highly misleading, as it conflates different types of fire (many of which are not wildfires to begin with). Overall trends in area burned globally are strongly driven by decreases in intentional agricultural burning in tropical areas, which is not related to climate change.

In regions where non-agricultural fires occur naturally (including the western United States[e.g., 29-31], eastern Australia[32], and the Siberian Arctic[33], for example) there is strong evidence that climate change has already increased the severity and extent of wildfire[34].","The statement that “Area burned by wildfire increasing — No (area peaked in mid-19th century)” is misleading in its implication that climate change is not making wildfires worse or more extreme and deadly. The overall global decrease is mostly driven by less fire in what used to be more extensive savannahs and grasslands and is largely due to the human driven removal of flammable vegetation. In quantitative terms, fire in those grassy ecosystems account for around 70% of the total global area burnt, so the reduction in fire activity here outweighs the increase in burned area that we are seeing in other parts of the world over the last two decades where fires have greater impacts such as Canada, parts of the USA or Siberia.

In other words, where humans have not converted flammable landscapes to less or-non flammable landscapes by removing or changing the vegetation, warming temperatures are, overall, associated with an increase in fire activity. A very thorough recent global analysis of trends and fire knowledge overall is here[35].

And very importantly, associated with these regional increases, we have also seen a rise in fire impacts, for example in the number of fatalities. As reported in our wildfire trend analysis, in the period 1994-2014, an average of 71 deaths per year had been recorded in wildfire disasters recorded in the International Disaster Database[36]. Since 2015 this has risen to 122 deaths per year.

The observed decline in global average area burned has been misused numerous times to support false claims about the role of climate change in wildfire trends. Climate change as well as human activities affect global fire activity (see here for a summary and update on Doerr and Santin, 2016[36].",,,“Cereal yields [are not] decreasing”; “they have tripled since 1961”; “Food supplies per capita [are not] decreasing” — they “increased 31 per cent since 1961”,"This is also misleading because crop yield increase since the 1960s is related to the massive increase in nitrogen fertilization and agricultural industrialization. However, studies have shown that extreme events made more likely by global warming are associated with losses in crop yields[37-39] and peaks in crop prices[40].",,,,"There are no “Land area and beaches shrinking, coral islands submerged”, instead there has been “marginal expansion”","Observed expansion of beach areas is mainly due to human intervention and coastal management, not climate change.",,,,”mortality from ‘Extreme Weather Events’ has declined by 99 per cent since the 1920s”,"No reference to this claim. On the contrary, scientific attribution studies such as Mitchell et al. 2016 show clear impacts of extreme events on excessive mortality[21].",,,,”fewer people are dying from heat; death rates from climate-sensitive diseases like malaria and diarrhoea have decreased (since 1900 malaria death rates have declined 96 per cent); hunger rates have declined; poverty has declined (GDP per capita has quadrupled since 1950 even as CO2 levels have sextupled); life expectancy has more than doubled since the start of industrialisation; health adjusted life expectancy has increased”,"All of these have multiple confounding factors (e.g. technological, health and economical development) so that these changes cannot be directly linked to CO2, but also do not invalidate negative effects of climate change. As such, this statement is simply misleading.",,,,"“Almost everywhere you look, climate change is having only small, and often benign, impacts. The impact of extreme weather events ― hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts ― are, if anything, declining.”","This contradicts the evidence presented in dozens of scientific contributions, and summarized in IPCC reports[1].",This statement can be characterized as wishful thinking — contradicts all science-based evidence.,"It is misleading to state that flood magnitudes do not increase. Trend analyses of flood magnitudes in Europe have shown increases, decreases and no change depending on the location[41]. For example, increases have been observed in Ireland (during 1976–2009), Switzerland, Slovakia (for small catchments of 5–150 km2) and Norway (for rainfall-dominated catchments)[6,42-45].

Snowmelt floods, on the other hand, have been observed to decline in flood magnitude for Norway[45,46].

Rain-on-snow events (including floods caused by rain-on-snow) have been observed to increase at high elevations and decrease at low elevations, for Norway[47].

Future projections of flood magnitudes also show increases, decreases and no trends, depending on the location, catchment properties and flood-generating process. It is therefore misleading to state that flood magnitudes do not increase in the future.

Madsen et al. (2014) write: “With respect to hydrological projections of changes in flood frequency at the catchment scale, both positive and negative changes in extreme discharge are projected. Increases in peak discharges are projected for sub-basins in the Scheldt and Meuse in Flanders (Boukhris and Willems, 2008, Willems et al., 2010), for catchments in Denmark (Sunyer et al., 2010, Madsen et al., 2013), for Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg (Hennegriff et al., 2006) and Saxony-Anhalt (Hattermann et al., 2011) in Germany, for western, mid-northern and all of coastal Norway (Lawrence and Hisdal, 2011), for the Hron catchment in Slovakia (Hlavcová et al., 2007), in coastal, southern areas in Sweden (Bergström et al., 2012), and in many catchments within the UK (Reynard et al., 2001, Reynard et al., 2010, Prudhomme et al., 2003, Kay et al., 2006, Kay and Jones, 2012).”[48]",,“Death rates from such events have declined by 99% since the 1920s.”,"So mortality rates from hurricanes and tornadoes have decreased since the 1920s until now. Is this because these storms are more “benign” now than they were in the past as the author suggests, or is it because we are now much better at forecasting and preparing for them now than we were 100 years ago (before the invention of computers)?",,,,"“Even sea-level rise — predicted to be the most damaging impact of global warming — seems to be much less of a problem than thought, according to to the study’s findings.”","This is literally the opposite of what a growing body of recent evidence has shown. Research actually shows that rates of global sea level rise have accelerated in recent years[49], and estimates regarding the upper end of plausible further SLR over the coming century have actually increased considerably as the non-linear contribution by continental ice sheets comes into clearer focus[50]. So, if anything, sea level rise is becoming more of a problem than previously thought.

",,,,“A recent study showed that the Earth has actually gained more land in coastal areas in the last 30 years than it has lost through sea-level rise.”,Please provide this peer-reviewed study by a legitimate practicing environmental scientist to support this counterintuitive statement.,"This statement is false. The Earth has perhaps gained more “sandy beaches” along coastal areas according to the study cited. However, this is primarily due to coastal management, not sea-level rise. In fact, the authors of that study find large beach erosion in protected coastal areas (ie. regions without human intervention)[51].",,,“Nitrogen fertilisers and carbon dioxide fertilisation have together increased global food production by 111 per cent.”,"These are cherry-picked and highly misleading. The article cites increasing cereal yields as a reason why climate change is not a problem, but ignores the large evidence base showing that rising temperatures are damaging crop yields and slowing yield growth[11-13]. Moreover, benefits from CO2 fertilization saturate whereas damages from warming accelerate over time[9], meaning extrapolation from the historical record is not meaningful. To claim that nitrogen fertilizers are a benefit of fossil fuels is an extremely tortured logic and misleading in the extreme – synthetic fertilizers have very little to do with the question of how much to reduce energy generation from fossil fuels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“We are getting towards the end of the warm period, the peak of the warmth was about 5,000 years ago and we are heading for the next inevitable ice age,” he told Sky News host Cory Bernardi.

Professor Plimer says every occurrence of icebergs expanding and shrinking happened with “more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than now”. 

“To use the word ‘unprecedented’ shows you have expunged history and geology from your knowledge.”",very_low,"Clickbait headline, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",268,"The video published by Sky News claims that “Earth’s climate is cyclical as new study claims an ice age is coming”, garnering more than 250 views in a few days. The video features Ian Plimer, who has repeatedly made false claims about climate change in the past. Scientists who reviewed this video found that it includes numerous inaccurate claims, misrepresents the findings of the study it discusses, and uses flawed reasoning that misleads viewers about the human-caused drivers of climate change.
Specifically, the video claims that “melting icebergs in the Antarctic could trigger a chain reaction that plunges Earth into a new ice age, scientists warn”. This claim also appeared as the headline of a Daily Mail article. This claim is inaccurate and misrepresents the results of the study it is based on. The study, which was recently published by Starr et al. in Nature, explores the sequence of events that occurred during glacial periods over the past 1.5 million years[1].

Ian Hall, a climate scientist at Cardiff University and author of the Nature study the claims are based on, told Climate Feedback, “This statement ignores the key finding from our study – we find that the climate systems response to Antarctic icebergs is highly sensitive to where they melt. We specifically describe the sequence of events which occurred during past interglacial to glacial conditions over the last 1.5 million years.”

Hall also explains that the results of this study cannot be extrapolated to current and future climate conditions. “Our paper is unambiguous and not relevant for modern/future climate change in this way, and reporting it as so is fundamentally misinterpreting our findings. Our study does not say or imply that an ice age is coming.”

The video and article headline take the results of the study out of context by neglecting to mention how the study focuses on past glacial periods and how current patterns of global warming might affect future patterns of Antarctic iceberg melt.

There are natural cycles of ice ages that occur over the span of 40,000 to 100,000 years and are linked to changes in Earth’s orbit around the Sun. However, these patterns don’t explain the recent trends in global warming caused by human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases. There are numerous scientific studies and several IPCC reports that all demonstrate how human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are driving global warming, contrary to the video’s claims[2-8].",,,,,"Twila Moon, Research Scientist, University of Colorado, Boulder","This video is chock full of false and misleading information, and presented in a way to make the correct scientific information seem like a farce. For example, the direct link between human emissions of carbon dioxide and global warming is very well established[8]. The physics and chemistry of this link has been understood for well over 100 years, and science continues to affirm it. In another example, projections of the Earth’s future temperature – created through the efforts of thousands of scientists across the globe – show that the planet will continue to warm under all scenarios of continued emissions of heat-trapping gases. There will NOT be a sudden natural cooling over the coming centuries. Humans are warming the planet, and human actions will continue to be the primary control on future temperature trends for the Earth.","Peter Neff, Assistant Research Professor, University of Minnesota","This fawning, biased interview with Sky’s favorite denier missed the point of the new paper about Antarctic iceberg and freshwater forcing on ocean circulation[1]. If they’d only read the Daily Mail article about this work, they’d see this statement: “Over the past three million years the Earth has regularly plunged into ice age conditions, but at present is currently situated within an interglacial period where temperatures are warmer. However, it may not happen again in the same way, due to the impact of human-created CO2 emissions warming the world.” For Plimer to think that human activities don’t affect planetary energy balance means he possesses arrogance that far eclipses his understanding of Earth’s climate system.","Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University","The starting point of the segment is an article in the Daily Mail, which mistakenly claims scientists are now warning of an incoming ice age, in a new study[1]. The study in question does no such thing, of course (which is actually clear if you read, not even the study, but the Daily Mail article itself), but the host and his guest, Ian Plimer, are not ones to care for such details and are all too happy to seize on this misleading, sensationalist headline to then deliver the usual mix of cherry-picked, out-of-context, and flatly wrong elements that have been addressed many times before, such as “climate has varied before”, “not unprecedented”, and “it’s the sun”.","Willem Huiskamp, Postdoctoral research fellow, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research","In this video Cory Bernardi and well known climate science denier Ian Plimer deliberately misrepresent the findings of a recent article published by Starr et al. in Nature[1]. They imply that the mechanism proposed in the paper, ie., a reorganisation of the Atlantic Overturning cell due to changes in Antarctic iceberg-derived freshwater fluxes during glacial periods can somehow be applied to the present day and as a result, that a glacial period is imminent.

This is patently absurd – the described mechanism is one feedback in a series that are required for a glacial inception and cannot simply be applied in isolation to the present day climate in which we have dramatically increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2, a potent greenhouse gas.

Ian Plimer of course ignores this – claiming that climate is cyclical and that no one has ever proven anthropogenic CO2 to have driven global warming. Both claims have been extensively debunked here at Climate Feedback on previous occasions (see reviews here, here, and here), but to offer a brief refutation of the first point: The Earth’s climate is indeed cyclical over time-periods of multiple millennia and are driven primarily by the Earth’s orbital cycles. It is true that we are currently in a warm interglacial period and that up until the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, the world was gradually cooling again (see this figure by Ed Hawkins).

However, the magnitude of greenhouse gases we have emitted into the atmosphere and the rate at which we have done so has been sufficient to overpower this natural cycle and warm the Earth considerably.

Even with a slow down (which we have observed and even expect in a warming world)[9], or even shutdown of the Atlantic overturning circulation, this warming will continue as long as concentrations of greenhouse gases increase.","Dan Jones, Physical Oceanographer, British Antarctic Survey","This video features a large number of incorrect statements. Many of these statements are myths that have been debunked again and again. In the video, Plimer and the anchor suggest that climate scientists in the 1970s predicted an ice age. This is not an accurate summary of scientific thinking in the 1970s. Peterson et al. (2008) showed that global warming was a prominent hypothesis in that decade[10].

They claim that “We are getting towards the end of a warm period. The peak of the warmth was about 5,000 years ago and we are heading to the next inevitable ice age.” There is no evidence for this claim. Plimer is essentially stating, without evidence, that the climate system will continue operating just as it has for hundreds of thousands of years. This statement ignores the fact that the climate system changes that we have already observed have the fingerprints of human activity all over it (e.g., the stratosphere is cooling, which is a characteristic pattern of global warming). You cannot explain recent warming since the 1850s without including human-driven carbon dioxide emissions.

They claim, “No one has ever shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.” This is a misleading statement that ignores the entire history of climate science. We have known since the time of the US Civil War (the UK Victorian Era) that carbon dioxide acts as a greenhouse gas. If more carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere, then more energy will arrive at Earth’s surface. Adding energy to the climate system will change it; that extra energy does not simply vanish. Notably, we cannot explain warming since the 1970s using natural factors alone; we have to consider anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to explain this decadal scale warming.

Ian Plimer has strong connections to the Australian mining industry, which has a personal stake in preserving our current fossil-fuel heavy energy system. This was not disclosed during the interview, as Plimer was simply presented as a geologist.

In the interview, Plimer suggests that the Australian Bureau of Meteorology is only using relatively short records of the past few decades to understand climate change. This statement ignores how climate science operates. The scientists working at the bureau will also be familiar with the literature on long-term climate change; it is disingenuous to suggest that they somehow don’t have access to or an understanding of the data and literature on long-term climate cycles.

Plimer goes on an irrelevant rant about the education system, suggesting that anyone who disagrees with him is somehow poorly educated. This is an example of the “No true Scotsman” logical fallacy and is incorrect reasoning.","David Battisti, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington","It is old news (50+ years) that glacial cycles are due to changes in insolation (not CO2) that are due to variations in the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, and that these glacial cycles have time scales of 40,000 -100,000 years. Many of the statements in this video make it clear that the commentator (Plimer) does not understand the scientific article, which relates to a potential feedback that may operate in glacial cycles.

But the main thrust of the comments made in the interview concern whether changes in CO2 impact climate, whether humans are responsible for the increases in CO2, and the impacts of the increased CO2 on climate. The reviewer asks for 5 papers that show these links. I will simply note that the all 5 IPCC Assessment reports document the overwhelming evidence (thousands of peer reviewed papers) that: (i) CO2 is increasing due to burning of fossil fuels, that (ii) the warming of the planet seen since 1850 is much greater than can be explained by solar forcing, but it is entirely consistent with the warming expected due to the observed increase in CO2 and changes in atmospheric aerosols (also due to human activity).","Michael Lockwood, Professor of Space Environment Physics, University of Reading","The idea of an ice age being triggered by global warming appears to be an extrapolation of what happened at the end of the last ice age in an interval called the Younger Dryas. As the world emerged from the last ice age it was pitched back into this further cold interval (named after a flower that thrived in the cold throughout Europe at the time). There have been a number of theories of its origin, of which some are now generally discounted, such as a comet impact.  It is known that as the world warmed, a huge meltwater lake (Lake Agassiz) formed on the north American continent, the remnants of which today are the Great Lakes. A disruption of the Atlantic MOC (i.e. the Gulf stream) by the escaping cold, salt-free meltwater may have caused a temporary reverse in the global warming and a temporary return to ice age conditions[11].  Whatever the mechanism, it is thought such an event is likely to have been an inevitable consequence of the end of the glaciation[13]. As an analogy and predictor for what might happen because of present global warming, it is of no relevance whatsoever:  the global warming involved in causing the Younger Dryas was that at the end of an ice age – the ice sheets that melted were vast and reached down to temperate latitudes (in the UK it reached Oxford!).

The video invokes solar changes as a cause of ice ages. This is wrong. They are intimately connected by changes in Earth’s orbit around the Sun – the so called “Milankovich cycles”[13,14]. These are indeed cycles and it is certainly true that Earth will return to another ice age. It is also true that another ice age is “due” in the sense that the present interglacial (warm period), the holocene, has been unusually long. The quip about it happening on a Tuesday hides the central fallacy here. The Milankovich cycles are extremely long and what is “due” on their timescales is far, far into the future even on the timescale of anthropogenic global climate change which has been centuries (but is now rapidly turning to decades).

The video says carbon dioxide rose at the start of ice ages. This is not true. We know well how the abundances of all atmospheric gases, including CO2, changed during ice ages from analysis of air bubbles in ice sheets and dating when that ice formed[15]. Carbon dioxide fell during the ice ages – not because it had any causative role in forming the ice age (as explained, above they are caused by changes in Earth’s orbital characteristics), rather, because colder water can store more carbon dioxide and because much carbon dioxide became locked into the ice and no longer took part in the carbon cycle exchanges between the atmosphere and the oceans and biosphere.  We know this was a response and not a cause because the CO2 changes lag, not precede, the temperature changes.

Lastly, asking for 5 papers that show that anthropogenic carbon dioxide is causing global warming reveals a complete failure of understanding of the science – indeed of science in general.  It is like asking for 5 papers that prove that a pain in your stomach, head or chest is due to cells on your body in which the cell division (which is part of the normal replacement and replication procedure in growth and repair) has gone into overdrive: in other words, what we refer to in a shorthand as a cancer.  Our knowledge of cancer and its causes does not rest on 5 papers, nor can it be summed up in 5 papers. It rests on thousands and thousands of papers which cancer experts knit together into a coherent understanding. It is exactly the same with climate change science.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Cardiff University has released a study on the ice ages, It claims that icebergs melting in the Antarctic may actually trigger a reaction that plunges Earth into an ice age.”",This statement ignores the key finding from our study – we find that the climate systems response to Antarctic icebergs is highly sensitive to where they melt. We specifically describe the sequence of events which occurred during past interglacial to glacial conditions over the last 1.5 million years.,"The authors of the study did not say that – as the Daily Mail notes itself. Paleoclimate scientists understand that the cyclical ice ages of the last million years or so are linked to small, cyclical changes in the Earth’s orbit, but the exact mechanistic details are not fully understood: the new Nature paper that the Daily Mail reports on, suggests a role for changes in the spatial patterns of iceberg melt in the inception of past ice ages. It doesn’t say current melt is going to trigger a new ice age: as the Daily Mail itself writes, “The impact of human-created CO2 emissions could make the Southern Ocean too warm for Antarctic icebergs to reach, bringing an end to this 1.6 million year cycle of ice ages starting with melting icebergs, study authors warned.” So, kind of the opposite actually. So the article headline is plain wrong, and so is the premise of the Sky News segment.",,,“But I thought alarmists were telling us that our approach to climate was leading us into believing that we’re the direct cause of global warming and we’re all going to boil and now we’re saying the ice age is coming again.”,"Our paper is unambiguous and not relevant for modern/future climate change in this way, and reporting it as so is fundamentally misinterpreting our findings. In fact, in the press release for the study, we emphasise that our findings are specifically related to natural “Milankovitch” cycles in orbital forcing, however with current human greenhouse-gas emissions and increasing global temperatures, the Southern Ocean is likely too warm for icebergs to be transported as described in the paper and melt in the regions necessary for the chain of events we highlight to be triggered. Our study does not say or imply that an ice age is coming. It does emphasise the importance of understanding iceberg trajectories and melt patterns in developing the most robust predictions of their future impact on ocean circulation and climate.",,,,"“What’s going on is cycles – we’re getting towards the end of a warm period, the peak of the warmth was about 5000 years ago, and we are heading for the next
inevitable ice age.”","“What’s going on is cycles” is at least a reference to our paper. However, the paper does not deal with modern (post-industrial) climate timescales. The statement by Ian Plimer is not supported by the majority of scientific evidence regarding the duration of the ‘present interglacial’. Plimer here is lacking an understanding of the concept of thresholds. It is well established that the onset of a glacial period has only ever, and can only ever, occur when atmospheric CO2 is below a certain threshold. When atmospheric CO2 concentration is too high, the orbital forcing which favours an ice age is simply not enough to cause an ice age. For example, a study by Archer and Ganapolski (2005) found that no glacial inception will occur with atmospheric CO2 concentrations above 400 ppm[16]. Tzedakis et al. (2012) go on to show that under the current orbital configuration, a CO2 concentration of below pre-industrial levels would be required for an ice age to begin[17]. Hypothetically, if atmospheric CO2 was lower than around 240 ppm, we might have seen the inception of an ice age develop at some point over the coming several millennia. However, as we approach atmospheric CO2 concentrations of double this, caused by human greenhouse-gas emissions, the scientific consensus is clear: we are not currently heading for an ice age.

Regarding the “5000 year cooling trend” alluded to by Plimer, it is important to recognise that this is still an active area of research. Whether the Holocene was characterised by a long-term cooling or warming trend is a more complex question than this comment suggests. It is in fact likely that different temperature trends prevailed over different regions[18]. Whilst Holocene climate variability is an interesting exercise in our understanding of the climate system, it is important to remember that regardless of whether there was a long-term cooling or warming trend over the Holocene, the warming we have experienced since the industrial era is unprecedented in its rate – this is not part of some long-term trend, it is very clearly an anthropogenic perturbation of the climate system.","It’s true that we are in an interglacial period, the Holocene, which, prior to the abrupt warming of the past century, had been warmest around 6000 years ago, as far as paleo-climate scientists can reconstruct. However, owing to recent man-made warming, there’s every indication that current temperatures are now on par with the warmest temperatures of even that period[19], and they will continue to increase because of greenhouse gas emissions, to a level (for instance, +3 degrees compared to pre-industrial temperatures) probably not seen in the last couple million years. So we are not headed into an ice age any time soon.

In fact, a study in Nature showed that, even without man-made CO2 emissions and warming, the next orbitally-driven ice age would probably not have happened before another 50,000 years (which is a bit unusually long)[20]; and given current man-made warming, now it won’t happen for another 100,000 years[19,20].",,,"“We’ve had 6 major ice ages, during which we’ve had glaciations and warmer periods – all of that happened before humans were on planet earth.”","It is not clear where Plimer got the number 6 from here. Using a conservative definition of an ice age, there have been at least 10 in the last 1 million years, with over 50 since the development of a substantial northern hemisphere ice sheet[21].","Causes of past climate fluctuations are relatively well understood, paced by slight changes in Earth’s orbit around the sun (Milankovitch cycles). That human emissions of greenhouse gases are currently trapping heat and warming the planet is accepted fact. Our activities now exert more control on Earth’s climate than orbital variations, and will override any coming ice age based on orbitally-induced decreases in the amount of incoming solar radiation.",,,“Every single major ice age started when we had more CO2 in the atmosphere than now.”,"Again, it is not clear where this claim comes from, it is simply not supported by any existing records of atmospheric CO2 over the Pleistocene[22,23]. The highest CO2 concentration recorded in ice core records (0 – 800 thousand years ago) is around 300 ppm[22]; the highest Pleistocene CO2 reconstructed using geochemical proxies (boron isotopes) is similar, around 300ppm[23]. Indeed, over the past 23 million years, CO2 has never reached atmospheric concentrations as high as today, maxing out at around 350 ppm during the mid-Miocene[24].",,,,"“No-one has ever shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming. If you think it has been shown, please give me the 5 scientific papers that show
this.”","Among the vast scientific literature on this topic, the following 5 papers are a good starting point:

How do we know that the increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations are from humans burning
fossil fuels? The Suess effect[2,3]. How do we know that this CO2 drives global warming? Our understanding of the physics of radiative forcing date back at least to the work of Svente Arrhenius (1859 – 1927). This is not a contentious topic in the modelling of Earth’s climate system. From the simple to the sophisticated, our models of the climate system are unequivocal[4], as are the geological data[5,6].","This rhetorical and, frankly, absurd point by Ian Plimer (and others) has been addressed before in other reviews. Yes, there is no one silver bullet argument, but multiple lines of evidence. In a way it’s a akin to a murder trial: sure, there is no one videotape absolutely “proving” that CO2 killed the victim, but we know CO2 was there, had the means and the motive (it’s a greenhouse gas), there’s even partial eye witness account (showing the increase in greenhouse effect in observations)[7], there is DNA evidence (~climate modeling shows CO2 explains the warming well) and all the other possible suspects (sun, volcanoes, etc) have solid alibis. So the case has been solved for a while now[7].","This is an easily verified falsehood. Plimer should be aware of work by Australian colleagues at the Commonwealth Science and Industrial and Research Organization (CSIRO) that shows how carbon dioxide emissions have rapidly increased in the last 150 years, using Antarctic ice and bubbles of old air trapped inside (locked in as snowflakes trap air between their fingers and are buried). The Law Dome research site in Antarctica is a keystone in our understanding of the atmospheric carbon budget going back the last 2000 years. I was a leader of the most recent scientific expedition to this important location, and can verify that the work of Plimer’s fellow Australian’s at this site is world class (see here). Not only is a ~40% increase in carbon dioxide observed in the last 150 years, but the stable isotope of carbon, 13-C has declined over that period. That definitively indicates that the carbon dioxide being emitted comes from a source depleted in 13-C, which provides clear evidence for attribution of industrial period carbon dioxide variations to human activity (fossil fuel hydrocarbons are depleted in 13-C). See figure 6 of Rubino et al., 2013 below[25].","Plimer goes on to make absurd arguments based on common cultural tropes and lines of division, suggesting that those living in cities and having “very little outdoor experience.” This has nothing to do with one’s understanding and experience of climate and has no relevance to the science of climate change and the unprecedented warmth that Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology reports year after year. Given our understanding of the factors at play, it is clear that human emissions of greenhouse gases is trapping excess heat in the atmosphere, causing warming that is particularly impacting Australia by way of extreme drought and severe fires. Australia’s temperature has been rapidly rising since this new anthropogenic warming emerged in the last ~century. The climate of the deep past is immaterial here, as this time is not analogous to the working of Earth’s climate system today, as any geologist would know if they were properly educated at a modern, degree-granting institution of higher education.",“Most of [the cycles in climate] are driven by… the sun.”,"This is again, easily disproven. Solar variability does not exert warming that matches observed temperature increases.

Guardian article on Arctic methane emissions claiming “a new climate feedback loop may have been triggered” lacks important context,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-article-on-arctic-methane-emissions-lacks-important-context-jonathan-watts/,"Sleeping giant' Arctic methane deposits starting to release, scientists find",http://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/27/sleeping-giant-arctic-methane-deposits-starting-to-release-scientists-find,"Scientists say they have found evidence that frozen methane deposits in the Arctic Ocean have started to be released over a large area of the continental slope off the East Siberian coast, the Guardian can reveal.

High levels of the potent greenhouse gas have been detected down to a depth of 350 metres in the Laptev Sea near Russia, prompting concern among researchers that the discovery could have “serious climate consequences”.

The slope sediments in the Arctic contain a huge quantity of frozen methane and other gases – known as hydrates. Methane has a warming effect 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years. The United States Geological Survey has previously listed Arctic hydrate destabilisation as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change.

The international team onboard the Russian research ship R/V Akademik Keldysh said most of the bubbles were currently dissolving in the water but methane levels at the surface were four to eight times what would normally be expected and this was venting into the atmosphere.

“At this moment, there is unlikely to be any major impact on global warming, but the point is that this process has now been triggered. This East Siberian slope methane hydrate system has been perturbed and the process will be ongoing,” said the Swedish scientist Örjan Gustafsson, of Stockholm University, in a satellite call from the vessel.

The scientists – who are part of a multi-year International Shelf Study Expedition – stressed their findings were preliminary. Methane seeps detected in the past were found to be historic, but the expedition believes these are new based on an earlier study showing movement of the subsea permafrost between the early 1980s and 2015. The scale of methane releases will not be confirmed until they return, analyse the data and have their studies published in a peer-reviewed journal.

But the discovery of potentially destabilised slope frozen methane raises concerns about the potential impact on the speed of global heating.

The Arctic is considered ground zero in the debate about the vulnerability of frozen methane deposits – which have been called the “sleeping giants of the carbon cycle” - in the ocean, and if releases were to exceed a tipping point it could increase the speed of global heating.

With the Arctic temperature now rising more than twice as fast as the global average, the question of when – or even whether – they will be released into the atmosphere has been a matter of considerable uncertainty in climate computer models.

The 60-member team on the Akademik Keldysh believe they are the first to observationally confirm the methane release is already under way across a wide area of the slope about 600km offshore.

At six monitoring points over a slope area 150km in length and 10km wide, they saw clouds of bubbles released from sediment.

At one location on the Laptev Sea slope at a depth of about 300 metres they found methane concentrations of up to 1,600 nanomoles per litre, which is 400 times higher than would be expected if the sea and the atmosphere were in equilibrium.

Igor Semiletov, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who is the chief scientist onboard, said the discharges were “significantly larger” than anything found before. “The discovery of actively releasing shelf slope hydrates is very important and unknown until now,” he said. “This is a new page. Potentially they can have serious climate consequences, but we need more study before we can confirm that.”

The most likely cause of the instability is an intrusion of warm Atlantic currents into the east Arctic. This “Atlantification” is driven by human-induced climate disruption.

The latest discovery potentially marks the third source of methane emissions from the region. Semiletov, who has been studying this area for two decades, has previously reported the gas is being released from the shelf of the Arctic – the biggest of any sea.

For the second year in a row, his team have found crater-like pockmarks in the shallower parts of the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea that are discharging bubble jets of methane, which is reaching the sea surface at levels tens to hundreds of times higher than normal. This is similar to the craters and sinkholes reported from inland Siberian tundra earlier this autumn.

Temperatures in Siberia were 5C higher than average from January to June this year, an anomaly that was made at least 600 times more likely by human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. Last winter’s sea ice melted unusually early. This winter’s freeze has yet to begin, already a later start than at any time on record.",low,"Clickbait headline, Lack of context",2918,"This article “‘Sleeping giant’ Arctic methane deposits starting to release, scientists find” was published in The Guardian in October 2020, and has received more than 150,000 interactions on social media, according to CrowdTangle. The article is based on interviews with scientists aboard a research vessel in the Arctic, but their research is preliminary and has not been published.
Scientists who reviewed the article explained that it presents some sensational claims and lacks important context. It is not known whether the methane released from the seafloor in this location of the Laptev Sea represents a new or changing release, contrary to the article’s claim, “concern among researchers that a new climate feedback loop may have been triggered that could accelerate the pace of global heating.” It is also not known how much of that methane is reaching the atmosphere, as methane is often dissolved in the seawater and oxidized in these deep settings[1].

In some ocean regions where temperature and pressure conditions allow, methane produced by the slow decay of organic matter in seafloor sediments can be trapped in icy deposits called “methane hydrates”. Such deposits can release localized plumes of methane gas bubbles, which have been observed in a number of locations, including the Laptev Sea. Methane hydrates are a focus of careful study due to concerns that they could thaw in warming waters, leading to an increasing release of carbon into the atmosphere that could contribute to additional global warming.

Many sites of methane plumes are only newly discovered and lack long-term measurements, which makes it difficult to determine whether they are increasing. Dating techniques applied to some plumes near Svalbard, however, revealed that they are several thousand years old[2]. Sources of methane emissions cannot be assumed to be new simply because they are being observed for the first time.

One method for evaluating trends in these methane seeps is to study global methane emissions and estimate the various sources. This work has shown that, through 2017, Arctic methane emissions do not appear to have increased over the past two decades[3,4], meaning these seeps are not currently having a significant impact on climate change. The largest human-caused emissions of methane come from agriculture, waste management, and fossil fuels, while natural methane emissions are dominated by wetlands (see figure below).

The Guardian article notes that this data is preliminary and the work has not yet been submitted for peer review. One of the scientists involved is also quoted explaining that, “At this moment, there is unlikely to be any major impact on global warming.” But the article also emphasizes the claim that “the discovery of potentially destabilised slope frozen methane raises concerns that a new tipping point has been reached that could increase the speed of global heating.”

Additional context would help readers better understand the significance of the reported methane observations and their relationship to climate change.",,,,,"Frans-Jan W. Parmentier, Associate Professor, Lund University & University of Oslo","This article’s claim that methane deposits in the Arctic Ocean are starting to be released, awakening a “sleeping giant”, cannot be supported by the limited observational data. Besides, even if these newly found seeps are increasing, they are located too deep in the ocean to have a significant impact on the concentration of methane in the atmosphere.

First of all, a newly discovered source is not the same as a changing source. Second, these findings are not unexpected nor the first of their kind in the Arctic. Gas hydrates are commonly found along continental slopes at depths where high pressures and low temperatures allow for their existence. The presence of hydrates to the west of high-arctic Svalbard is well-known[5]. These hydrates have been studied extensively and occur at a similar depth as the recent findings reported by the Guardian. This makes for an ideal comparison to understand what’s going on in the Laptev Sea.

The gas hydrates near Svalbard have been venting methane for at least 3,000 years, induced by geological processes rather than global warming[2], while methane release varies with the seasons[6]. Similar processes may be at play for the gas hydrate deposits found in the Laptev Sea. This underlines the need to monitor methane seeps over a long time period before rushing to the conclusion that they are increasing due to recent climate change. Model studies show that the impact of climate change on gas hydrates will be a slow process, over timescales from centuries up to a millennium[7,8].

Most importantly, the ocean is an efficient filter for methane when the water is more than 100 m deep[1]. When bubbles rise up towards the surface, methane quickly dissolves into the ocean water and is removed through oxidation[1,9]. Since the hydrates near Svalbard and in the Laptev Sea are located below a depth of 300 m, they are unlikely to influence atmospheric concentrations—even when they start to destabilize. Although the article in the Guardian acknowledges that most methane dissolved into the ocean water, the researchers also report that “methane levels at the surface were four to eight times what would normally be expected and this was venting into the atmosphere”. Elevated methane levels are not uncommon in the ocean, also near Svalbard[9]. More than a thousand gas seeps have been documented along the coast of Svalbard[10] (just six were reported by the recent expedition in the Laptev Sea). Despite the widespread release of methane into the ocean off the coast of Svalbard and extensive monitoring with land-based, ship-based and airborne methods, no significant impact on the atmosphere has been found[11]. In fact, the small amount of methane that is released at hotspots is offset by an enhanced uptake of CO2 in the same area[12].

It should be noted that the researchers interviewed by the Guardian have previously suggested very high emissions from the shallower parts of the Laptev Sea and nearby seas[13], where methane can escape to the atmosphere in larger quantities. However, three independent studies that tried to confirm those results showed that those estimates were overestimated by about a factor of five[14,15,16]. While high methane concentrations have been detected near seeps in the Laptev Sea[17], these elevated concentrations are highly localized, which makes them less important at the regional scale[14].

The article in the Guardian grossly exaggerates a small source that is unlikely to increase, while using frightening metaphors of the awakening of a “sleeping giant”. This draws attention away from genuine feedbacks in the Earth system such as the release of carbon from permafrost thaw, the deterioration of global ecosystems, and the rapid loss of sea ice. Anthropogenic methane emissions are roughly 50 to 70 times larger than emissions from the Arctic Ocean, and we can compensate for Arctic methane release by reducing anthropogenic emissions with present-day technology[18]. That’s the real giant that we can and should tackle, rather than hypothetical sea monsters.","Ben Poulter, Research Scientist, NASA","The article claims that frozen methane, stored in ocean sediments in the Arctic, has become destabilized and is being emitted to the atmosphere. The article generally overlooks the fact that 1) the methane emitted from the sediments does not escape to the atmosphere because it is oxidized in the water column, 2) the methane fluxes the research crew are measuring have been detected in previous cruises and are not an indicator of a rapid change, and 3) this work has been disputed previously through independent studies using atmospheric, or top-down, constraints to measure the Arctic methane budget.","Paul Overduin, Senior Scientist, Alfred Wegener Institute","The words “starting” and “triggering” tacitly assume that the beginning of a process was observed (i.e., that has not taken place until now). The article provides no evidence to support this assumption. “Triggering” connotes a small impulse leading to an explosive result—this word choice is not neutral, but highly suggestive.

The article then softens the claim of a new release/source relevant to climate: “…most of the bubbles were currently dissolving…”, “…findings were preliminary” and “…will not be confirmed until they return”.

The article then goes on to contradict the assumption of “starting”: methane emissions have been observed before (“the third source of methane emissions from the region”, “previously reported the gas is being released”, “second year in a row”). No differentiation is provided between previous and current observations.

Important context is omitted: such methane emissions are observed at many locations on Arctic slopes and could be expected at this location. Currently, Arctic methane sources are a small contribution to atmospheric methane. The source of the methane observed in this story is of central importance in judging whether it is sensitive to climate change or likely to be large enough to affect climate. Only one mention of the source is made: “gas hydrate”, without any background.

This is a very understudied part of a region that is most strongly affected by climate change. It is tremendously challenging for science to fund research and every new observation is of value and should be analyzed thoroughly and soberly, in context.","David Archer, Professor, University of Chicago","Putting these new methane emissions into a global context, they are much smaller than emissions fluxes from tropical wetlands, the main natural source. This means that unless Arctic methane fluxes blow up by a factor of 100 or more, they won’t play a huge role in global warming. I was relieved by the first quote in the article, beginning “At this moment, there is unlikely to be any major impact on global warming…,” but I was less happy with a later quote, “Potentially they can have serious climate consequences, but we need more study before we can confirm that.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article by The Daily Caller oversimplifies drivers of wildfires and downplays role of climate change,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-by-the-daily-caller-oversimplifies-drivers-of-wildfires-and-downplays-role-of-climate-change-chris-white/,"Wildfires Will Become Worse Thanks To Decades-Old Liberal Policies, Says Fire Expert Who Predicted Uptick In Blazes",https://dailycaller.com/2020/09/13/california-oregon-wildfires-land-management-climate-change/,"Former President Bill Clinton made a significant change to federal land management nearly 30 years ago that created the conditions necessary for massive wildfires to consume portions of the West Coast, according to one fire expert who predicted the problem years ago.
Shortly before leaving office in 2001, Clinton limited the ability of the United States Forest Service to thin out a dense thicket of foliage and downed trees on federal land to bring the West into a pristine state, Bob Zybach, an experienced forester with a PhD in environmental science, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. The former president’s decision created a ticking time bomb, Zybach argues.
“If you don’t start managing these forests, then they are going to start burning up. Thirty years later, they are still ignoring it,” said Zybach, who spent more than 20 years as a reforestation contractor. He was referring to warnings he made years ago, telling officials that warding off prescribed burns in Oregon and California creates kindling fuelling fires.
Such rules make it more difficult to deploy prescribed burns, which are controlled burns designed to cull all of the underbrush in forests to lessen the chance of massive fires, Zybach noted. Years of keeping these areas in their natural state result in dead trees and dried organic material settling on the forest floor, turning such material into matchsticks soaked in jet fuel during dry seasons, he said.
Zybach’s comments come as wildfires continue churning through parts of California, Oregon, and Washington, media reports show. Fires have killed 26 people in West Coast states since August, including 19 people in California, and have culminated in more than half-a-million people evacuating Oregon, a number representing roughly 10% of the state’s overall population.
Roughly 100 massive fires are blazing Saturday in the West, including 12 in Idaho and nine in Montana, the National Interagency Fire Center said Saturday. All told, the wildfires have churned through more than 4.5 million acres in 12 states. (RELATED: Wildfires, Blackouts And High Gas Prices: Californians Fight Familiar Foes Amid Pandemic)
Shortly before leaving office, Clinton introduced the Roadless Rule that restricted the use of existing roads and construction of new roads on 49 million acres of National Forest, making it difficult for officials to scan the land for the kind of kindling that fuels massive conflagrations.
The move was part of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP), a resolution adopted by Clinton in 1994 to protect forests from being over-logged.
Ten years before Clinton’s rule, the Fish and Wildlife Service placed the northern spotted owl on the Endangered Species Act, forcing the Forest Service to adopt a new policy that resulted in a greater reduction in timber harvests. The amount of timber removed from federal lands plummeted, according to data accumulated in 2015 by the Reason Foundation.
An average of 10.3 billion feet of timber was removed each year from Forest Service land between 1960 and 1990, the data show. Those numbers dropped between 1991 and 2000 and continued dropping — an average of only 2.1 billion feet of timber was removed from the land between 2000 and 2013, according to the data. That’s an 80% decline.
“They’ve gone and left hundreds of thousands of acres of burnt timber, a fire bomb waiting to happen, standing in place because the black back woodpecker prefers that habitat,” Zybach said. “It’s great for lawyers, but it’s bad for people who breathe air or work in the woods.”
“The prescribed burns are an ancient form of management for keeping the fuels down so these events don’t happen,” Zybach added, referring to Native American Indians who used controlled burns to ward away pests and prevent wildfires from licking their homes.
The Clinton administration’s plan to turn forests in the West into pristine land free of human interference risked fueling “wildfires reminiscent of the Tillamook burn, the 1910 fires and the Yellowstone fire,” Zybach, who is based in Oregon, told Evergreen magazine in 1994, when the NWFP came into effect.
Western Oregon had one major fire above 10,000 acres between 1952 and 1987, reports show. The Silver Complex Fire of 1987 snapped that streak after torching more than 100,000 acres in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness area, killing rare plants and trees the federal government sought to protect from human activities.
Fire Experts Agree: Prescribed Burns Are Critical 
Overzealous fire suppression across California are helping to build up wildland fuels, which contribute to wildfires, according to Tim Ingalsbee, a fire ecologist who began a career in the 1980s as a wildland firefighter. The solution is “to get good fire on the ground and whittle down some of that fuel load,” he told ProPublica in August.
“It’s just … well … it’s horrible. Horrible to see this happening when the science is so clear and has been clear for years. I suffer from Cassandra syndrome,” Ingalsbee said, referring to the Cassandra Syndrome, a Greek metaphor people use when they believe their valid warnings are not heeded.
“Every year I warn people: Disaster’s coming. We got to change. And no one listens. And then it happens.”
Other experts have made similar arguments in the past. (RELATED: Decades Of Mismanagement Turned US Forests Into ‘Slow-Motion Time Bombs’)
Overgrown grasslands, forests, and woodlands contributed to California wildfires in 2017, Sasha Berleman, a fire ecologist, told High Country News that year. “I’m more certain than ever that there’s a lot we can do between now and the next time this happens to make it so that the negative consequences to people are nowhere near as dramatic,” she said.
The devastating fires that ran through California’s wine country in October of 2017 killed 42 people and destroyed nearly 7,000 buildings, High Country News noted.
The solution might be easier said than done. Nearly 20 million acres in California, or an area about the size of Maine, will need to experience controlled burns to limit catastrophic wildfires, a January study from Nature Sustainability found.
Blaming Climate Change
Former President Barack Obama suggested in a tweet Thursday that California’s wildfires are a result of climate change.
“The fires across the West Coast are just the latest examples of the very real ways our changing climate is changing our communities,” Obama wrote in a tweet that included pictures showing how soot and ash from the wildfires are turning San Francisco’s sky bright orange.
Obama isn’t the only prominent Democrat tying the fires to global warming.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, published a tweet Saturday that read: “The proof of the urgency of the climate crisis is literally in the air around us.” Schumer included a link to a Sept. 10 article from CBS blaming climate change for the fires.
Zybach is not convinced. “The lack of active land management is almost 100 percent the cause,” he told the DCNF, noting that climate change has almost nothing to do with fire kindling gathering across the forest floors. Other researchers share his skepticism.
“Global warming may contribute slightly, but the key factors are mismanaged forests, years of fire suppression, increased population, people living where they should not, invasive flammable species, and the fact that California has always had fire,” University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Mass told TheDCNF in 2018.
Mass’s critique came as Mendocino Complex Fire was spreading across California on its way to becoming the largest wildfire in the state, engulfing more than 283,000 acres.
EDITOR’S NOTE: A previous version of this article stated that an average of 10 million feet of timber was removed each year from Forest Service land between 1960 and 1990. The actual number was 10,3 billion. The article has been updated to reflect the change. ",low,"Biased, Clickbait headline, Misleading",247,"The article in The Daily Caller claims that land management practices enacted during the Clinton administration “paved the way for future debilitating wildfires.” The article received over 45,000 interactions on Facebook as of 28 Sept 2020, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. The article also appears on other media outlets, including The Daily Signal, The Stream, and Citizens Journal. Scientists who reviewed this article found that the article oversimplifies the complex drivers of wildfires in the western US and misleads readers by stating that land management practices enacted during the Clinton administration are the almost exclusive cause of severe wildfires today.
Specifically, the article states, “Former President Bill Clinton made a significant change to federal land management nearly 30 years ago that created the conditions necessary for massive wildfires to consume portions of the West Coast.” While land management practices, such as fire suppression do influence wildfire behavior, these practices were implemented long before the Clinton administration.

In the US, federal forest-fire management began in 1886 with the creation of the National Parks[1]. Forest reserves, which are now known as “National Forests,” were established a few years later, and in 1905, Gifford Pinchot became the first head of the United States Forest Service. As described in Stephens and Ruth (2005), “under his direction a national forest-fire policy was initiated. The suppression of forest fires dominated early forest policy.”[1]

This legacy of fire suppression in the US has persisted for more than a century, leading to an accumulation of trees and woody debris that fuels intense wildfires[2]. Contrary to these practices, many forested ecosystems in the western US are adapted to frequent, low-level, low-intensity fires[3]. Forest management practices, such as thinning and prescribed burns, can reduce fuel loads and the risk of severe wildfires, writes Valerie Trouet, an associate professor at the University of Arizona. However, other forest management practices, such as logging post-wildfire, can hinder tree regeneration and increase fire risk by increasing fuel loads (see figure below)[4].

In addition to forest management practices, human-caused climate change is a key driver of wildfire severity[2,5,6]. Specifically, climate change is causing warmer and drier conditions that increase the amount of dry vegetative fuel and total area burned during wildfires in the western US. As described in Abatzoglou and Williams (2016), “human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984,” (see figure below)[5].

These data and trends contrast with multiple claims in the article, including “‘The lack of active land management is almost 100 percent the cause,’ he told the DCNF, noting that climate change has almost nothing to do with fire kindling gathering across the forest floors,” and “‘Global warming may contribute slightly, but the key factors are mismanaged forests, years of fire suppression, increased population, people living where they should not, invasive flammable species, and the fact that California has always had fire,’ University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Mass told TheDCNF in 2018.”

Forest management policies, climate change, an increase in the number of people living close to wildlands, and numerous other factors influence the behavior of wildfires in the western US. While the article acknowledges the importance of forest management policies, it overlooks the role of climate change and other important drivers of wildfires, creating an oversimplified narrative that misleads readers.",,,,,"Zeke Hausfather, Director of Climate and Energy, The Breakthrough Institute","The causes of the increase in burned area in the western US in recent decades – and the record-setting fires of 2020 – are complex, driven by a mix of a changing climate, a 100-year legacy of overzealous fire suppression in forests adapted for frequent low-level fires, more people living in highly flammable wildland urban interface areas, and at times a counterproductive role of some environmental regulations. However, this article glosses over much of this complexity, presenting a simple but misleading narrative that land management rules enacted by the Clinton administration set the stage for the destructive fires we are experiencing today.

In reality, the large fuel build up we have seen in some western forests dates from well before the Clinton administration. Restrictions on logging only play a minor role, as most forests were not regularly logged and traditional logging is not a particularly effective form of fuel management. Large, mature trees are at relatively low fire risk; the problem is smaller pre-commercial trees and undergrowth that can allow fires to burn hotter and reach into the canopy of larger trees. Cutting down mature trees in many cases exacerbates the growth of denser and less fire-resistant replacement vegetation. Thinning of smaller trees, brush removal, and controlled burns are the most effective means of fuel reduction, and historically the timber industry has had little involvement in these activities.

At the same time, it is quite clear that a changing climate has played a large role in increasing fuel aridity and making conditions ripe for the severe fires we are experiencing today. The recent Fourth National Climate Assessment suggested that up to half the increase in burned area since the 1980s can be attributed to changing climate conditions, and recent work finds a clear link between climate change and increased burned area in the California Sierras[2,5,6]. While some uncertainties remain, this article highlights voices that are unrepresentative of the growing consensus among both climate and wildfire scientists on the role of climate in recent wildfire activity.

It is clear that we need improved forest management – more thinning of pre-commercial trees, brush removal, and controlled burns – to reduce fuel loading in western US forests and make up for the US Forest Service’s misguided legacy of fire suppression. And there are certainly cases where environmental rules have gotten in the way of effective forest management and need to be streamlined. But blaming the increase in fire activity solely on environmental regulation is a misrepresentation that minimizes other important factors and ignores the complex history of forest management in the western US.","Logan Berner, Assistant Research Professor, Northern Arizona University","The article paints recent fires in the western US as stemming from “Liberal” legislative efforts during the 1990s to protect old forests from unsustainable logging rather than from climate change. A large body of scientific research shows that year to year variability in regional burned area is strongly affected by summer air temperatures (see figure below).
Rising regional temperatures exponentially increase the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VDP), which causes forests to become drier and more flammable, contributing to the conflagrations currently observed in the region[5]. Other factors also contribute to this current problem, such as more people living and playing in urban-proximate forests, as well as a century of fire suppression leading to fuel accumulation in dry forests with historically frequent fire[1,2]. Nevertheless, climate change is a key driver of recent increases in fire activity across the western USA[2,5,6].","Amber Kerr, Researcher, Agricultural Sustainability Institute, University of California, Davis","This article’s focus on criticizing liberal policies in general and President Clinton in particular does not do justice to this highly complex issue. Fire suppression in western forests has been pursued in earnest for roughly a century, long predating Clinton’s terms as president. Likewise, the 1973 Endangered Species Act (protecting the spotted owl and other forest-dwelling species) was signed by a Republican president. Policymakers of all affiliations have worsened (or failed to solve) the West’s difficult wildfire problems.

The article does make some valid points, such as the fact that decades of fire suppression has created a dangerous disequilibrium in western forests with massive fuel loads of crowded trees and dense brush. The article is also on the right track in mentioning that logging could have (and may yet still) play a role in reducing this fuel load. But, like most of the article, this argument is oversimplified. Logging strategies differ depending on whether the goal is profit, fire prevention, wildlife habitat, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, many of the fire-prone areas in question are too rugged and remote for any commercially viable logging operation.

The article’s statements about prescribed burns are generally correct but incomplete. Prescribed burning is now (belatedly) recognized as a crucial management tool that has been underutilized due to bureaucratic obstacles and lack of incentives. Unfortunately, it is not possible to fix the problem by immediately and drastically increasing annual prescribed burn acreage. Many forests are now too dense; prescribed burns would become infernos that destroy human life and property, leaving a charred wasteland instead of a clean forest floor. Although there is no clear way out of this conundrum, fire experts are actively working on it. Native American controlled burning techniques are receiving an overdue resurgence of interest[8].

The most problematic part of the article is the climate change section. It misleadingly says that “climate change has almost nothing to do with fire kindling gathering across the forest floors.” True, but that is not the point. Climate change dries out the fuel and increases air temperatures, making fires more likely to start, more likely to spread, and more likely to reach catastrophic intensities. This seems to be what happened when the Creek Fire in Fresno County suddenly exploded into a conflagration during the record-breaking heat wave of 6 Sep. 2020. Climate change may also gradually kill trees via direct effects (temperature, drought) or indirect effects (pests, pathogens), creating an even more flammable landscape.

Experts do debate the relative contribution of poor forest management vs. climate change in creating the significant positive trend in acreage burned and numbers of large fires in recent decades in the West[9]. It’s not a simple or homogenous question, because fires in some forest types are more “fuel-limited” while fires in other forest types are more “climate-limited”[3]. But most peer-reviewed studies on this topic have identified climate change as an important factor over broad swaths of Western land area and vegetation types. For example, Abatzoglou and Williams (2016) estimated that climate change has already roughly doubled the acreage of forest fires in the Western US (comparing 1984-2015 to historical background levels)[5]. This trend is expected to accelerate: Littell et al. found that by 2040, “statistical climate‐fire models project large increases in area burned,” ranging from 43% to 240%, for the large majority of Western vegetation types. (Fuel-limited vegetation types, a minority of the total, were not expected to burn more)[10].

In conclusion, this Daily Caller article addresses an important topic in a superficial way, making some reasonable arguments but glossing over important details. The dismissal of climate change as a contributing factor to Western wildfires contradicts the best available evidence and appears to be politically rather than scientifically motivated.","Anthony LeRoy Westerling, Associate Professor, University of California, Merced","1) The article neglects the voluminous literature that connects increased frequency of large fires, increased area burned, and increased fire severity to climate.

2) The article focuses on one ecosystem type (seasonally dry mixed conifer forests with mixed severity fire regimes) where the impact of climate change has been exacerbated by fuel accumulation due to fire suppression, and misleadingly conflates this one factor with the increase in large fire frequency, size and severity across the region in a diverse array of ecosystems that are not affected by fire suppression in the same way.  It ignores that fire is increasing throughout the region, regardless of whether it is burning in ecosystems that have been changed by fire suppression or not. Many of the largest fires that are directly impacting communities in California and around the West are not burning in these seasonally dry forests.

3) The article conflates the effects of prescribed fire with the effects of logging on fuels. It ignores the fact that past logging focused on larger diameter trees, which are more profitable, rather than the removal of small diameter trees.  Removing small diameter trees while leaving large diameter mature trees can enhance seasonally dry forests’ resilience to fire and other climate change impacts, and result in greater stability of their stored carbon, but is not usually profitable without significant public subsidies.  Logging that maximizes removal of the most profitable timber can increase long term fire risk[4].

4) The article ignores the fact that spotted owls became endangered because most of their old growth habitat had already been logged over. Today, the challenge is to get mechanical fuels treatments and prescribed fire onto the landscape at scale in ways that can enhance the resilience of owls and other species’ habitat to climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bob Zybach,"Bob Zybach works at the Heartland Institute, a conservative think-tank. According to PBS Frontline, “Few entities have worked harder to instill doubt in American minds about the science of climate change than the Heartland Institute.”",,,,Those numbers dropped between 1991 and 2000 and continued dropping,The drop really began around 1988 (see figure below)[11].,,,,"They’ve gone and left hundreds of thousands of acres of burnt timber, a fire bomb waiting to happen, standing in place","The suggestion here seems to be that burned areas should have been salvage logged to reduce the risk of future fire. A seminal study from southern Oregon found that salvage logging not only reduced seedling establishment, but importantly increased fine and coarse fuels on the ground, likely increasing fire risk[4].",,,,"Zybach is not convinced. “The lack of active land management is almost 100 percent the cause,” he told the DCNF, noting that climate change has almost nothing to do with fire kindling gathering across the forest floors. Other researchers share his skepticism.","This statement is misleading. While climate change might not strongly affect the accumulation of “fire kindling,” it plays a huge role in how dry and flammable forests become during summer. A recent study published in the prestigious Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences found:

“Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984.”",,,,Global warming may contribute slightly,"Again, Abatzoglou and Williams (2016) show that “Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984.”[5]

Fuel aridity alone can explain about 75% of the year to year variability in burned area across the West and climate change is causing large parts of the region to become more arid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article by CNN exaggerates study’s implications for future Greenland ice loss with “point of no return” claim,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-by-cnn-exaggerates-studys-implications-for-future-greenland-ice-loss/,"Greenland's ice sheet has melted to a point of no return, according to new study",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/14/weather/greenland-ice-sheet/index.html,"Greenland's ice sheet has melted to a point of no return, and efforts to slow global warming will not stop it from disintegrating. That's according to a new study by researchers at Ohio State University.
""The ice sheet is now in this new dynamic state, where even if we went back to a climate that was more like what we had 20 or 30 years ago, we would still be pretty quickly losing mass,"" Ian Howat, co-author of the study and a professor at Ohio State University, said.
Greenland's ice sheet dumps more than 280 billion metric tons of melting ice into the ocean each year, making it the greatest single contributor to global sea level rise, according to Michalea King, the lead author of the study and researcher at Ohio State University.
The ice loss has been so massive in recent years, she said, that it has caused a measurable change in the gravitational field over Greenland.
Ice melting in Greenland contributes more than a millimeter rise to sea level every year, and that's likely to get worse. Sea levels are projected to rise by more than 3 feet by the end of the century, wiping away beaches and coastal properties.
Coastal states like Florida, and low-lying island nations are particularly vulnerable. Just 3 feet of sea level rise could put large areas of coastline underwater. Forty percent of the US population resides in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea level rise.
""There's a lot of places, like in Florida especially, where one meter alone would cover a lot of existing land areas,"" King said. ""And that's exacerbated when you get storms and hurricanes and things like that, that then cause extra surge on top of a higher baseline.""
The study also found that the ice sheet is retreating in rapid bursts, leading to a sudden and unpredictable rise in sea levels, making it difficult to prepare for the effects.
The study used four decades of satellite data to measure changes in Greenland's ice sheet. The authors found that after 2000, the ice sheet shrank so rapidly that replenishing snowfall would not keep up with the rate of melting from parts of the glacier newly exposed to warmer ocean water, even if climate change were reversed.
Entire coasts of ice are retreating at once due to climate change, Howat said, adding that all 200 glaciers that make up the Greenland ice sheet have been observed retreating within the same episode.
Even though the retreat of the Greenland Ice sheet likely cannot be reversed, it's just the first in a series of tipping points. If climate change continues at this rate, the rate of melting will get much worse.
""We've passed the point of no return but there's obviously more to come,"" Howat said. ""Rather than being a single tipping point in which we've gone from a happy ice sheet to a rapidly collapsing ice sheet, it's more of a staircase where we've fallen off the first step but there's many more steps to go down into the pit.""
",low,Exaggerating,351,"The article in CNN discusses findings from a study published August, 2020 that analyzes trends of ice discharge from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past three decades[1]. Reports on this study were also published by Reuters and Phys.org, receiving over 200,000 interactions on Facebook across the three articles, according to CrowdTangle. Scientists who reviewed this article found that many claims regarding ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and sea level rise are accurate. However, reviewers state that the headline misinterprets results from the study, potentially misleading readers about the future rate of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet. The article also overlooks the role of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions in the rate of future ice loss and sea level rise from the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Over the past several decades, the Greenland Ice Sheet has lost mass due to surface meltwater runoff and ice discharge resulting from global warming[1,2]. This loss of ice is a significant contributor to global sea level rise, as the Greenland Ice Sheet holds an equivalent of 7.2 m of sea level[2]. Estimates of the amount of melted ice dumped into the ocean from the Greenland Ice Sheet as well as its contributions to sea level rise were accurately reported in the CNN article. However, the study the article is based on does not model future rates of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet nor does it conclude that the ice sheet has passed the “point of no return,” as claimed in the CNN headline.

Specifically, the observational study examines rates of ice discharge (losses from icebergs and melting on the coast) from the Greenland Ice Sheet on a decadal scale over the past 34 years[1]. Between 1985 and 2018, there was a net loss of 4,200 Gt of mass from the Greenland Ice Sheet, in part due to ice discharge. The average rate of ice discharge from 2007 – 2018 was 14% greater than the average rate from 1985-1999 (see figure below).

The study authors also calculated the retreat of glacier fronts across all regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet, as quantified by front position and ice thickness (see figure below).

As described by the reviewers below, the CNN article also overlooks the role of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions in altering the future rate of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet as well the consequences for global sea level rise. For example, one study found that under a low-emissions scenario (RCP 2.6) the Greenland Ice Sheet will lose 8-25% of its present-day mass over the long-term, compared to a loss of 72-100% under a high-emissions scenario(RCP 8.5)[2].",,,,,"Stefan Rahmstorf, Professor, Potsdam University","While most of this article is correct, I have to give it a low credibility rating because the attention-grabbing headline conclusion is not supported by the study the article is about: “Greenland’s ice sheet has melted to a point of no return, and efforts to slow global warming will not stop it from disintegrating.”

What the paper actually finds is well described in its press release: “Even if humans were somehow miraculously able to stop climate change in its tracks […] the ice sheet would continue to shrink for some time.”[1]

The key phrase here is “for some time”. Based on the study, I conclude that the time scale meant here is decades, maybe a century. However, complete loss of the ice sheet would take about a millennium even with unmitigated warming, and the process which decides over the complete ice loss is surface melt—not the ice discharge by glaciers flowing into the ocean at the margins of the ice sheet, which the study is about. When the ice sheet shrinks, it will withdraw further and further from the coast and ice discharge into the ocean will become less important. This is shown by model simulations that continue all the way until complete ice loss.

The study reported on here is an observational study looking at ice flow changes in the past decades, not a model projection for future ice loss. It does not provide evidence about the eventual fate of the Greenland ice sheet. The impression given by many media articles, namely that the Greenland ice sheet is already doomed to be lost completely, is not supported by the evidence in the paper. While the concern about Greenland ice loss is certainly very serious and justified, the conclusion that it is already doomed is an over-interpretation of the results of this study.","Twila Moon, Research Scientist, University of Colorado, Boulder","The article correctly notes most measurements and facts and figures. However, it fails to provide nuance in critical areas regarding how quickly ice may be lost, whether this is a new scientific insight, and the role of human climate action in determining the future of Greenland ice loss (and associated sea level rise).","Luke Trusel, Assistant Professor, Pennsylvania State University","Greenland ice sheet melt and its discharge of ice into the ocean has increased over the last few decades, making it one of the largest contributors to global sea level rise. This is important and concerning, and there’s a clear human fingerprint on Greenland ice sheet mass trends. The referenced study by King and coauthors represents important new observations of Greenland’s mass loss and the large increases that have recently occurred[1].

However, the CNN article’s suggestion that Greenland has passed a tipping point is not well established. For example, a paper published in Nature Climate Change in 2018 by Pattyn and coauthors found that the tipping point (that is, the point where potentially irreversible change is set in motion) would be in the neighborhood of 1.5 to 2°C warming above pre-industrial[3]. We’re close, but not quite there yet.

In my opinion, the most important point that is missing in the article is that our emissions trajectories *right now and in the next few decades* are critical for determining the rates and magnitudes of mass loss and sea level contributions from the Greenland ice sheet. Lower emissions mean a lower likelihood of reaching a tipping point, as well as lower amounts of warming in the atmosphere and ocean. Less warming means lower rates of mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet and enables greater opportunity for humans to respond to changing sea levels[3].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"melted to a point of no return, and efforts to slow global warming will not stop it from disintegrating","While the Greenland ice sheet is certain to shrink further even without further warming, it is not at all clear whether it has crossed the point where it will be lost completely. The new study by King et al. has not examined this issue and does not say anything about it[1]. Neither does their press release, which states: “Even if humans were somehow miraculously able to stop climate change in its tracks […] the ice sheet would continue to shrink for some time.” It does not say “until it’s gone.”","It is correct that there is no longer a reasonable scenario in which the Greenland Ice Sheet is fully stabilized or gains significant ice. However, this statement ignores the very important matter of how quickly ice is lost. An excellent recent study by Aschwanden et al. demonstrates what a dramatic difference there is in ice loss under a low emissions scenario v. a high emissions scenario[2]. The critical matter right now (which has already been understood by glaciologists for some time) is not whether or not we lose ice from Greenland but how quickly ice is lost.",,,dumps more than 280 billion metric tons of melting ice into the ocean each year,"Yes, this is accurate. The Greenland Ice Sheet began consistently losing ice year-after-year around the turn of the 21st century and this number is close to the recent average for annual ice loss.",,,,greatest single contributor to global sea level rise,"Scientists may quibble over this. Glaciologists usually divide Earth’s ice into 3 categories: Greenland Ice Sheet, Antarctic Ice Sheet, all other glaciers/ice caps. The amount of ice lost annually from Greenland is now very similar to that lost each year from the “all other glaciers/ice caps” category.",,,,it has caused a measurable change in the gravitational field over Greenland,"Measuring changes in gravity is one important method used to determine how much ice is lost (or gained). There actually does not need to be a large change in ice mass for it to create a measurable change in the gravitational field. So it is a bit misleading to suggest that “measurable change in the gravitational field” is synonymous with “massive” ice loss. It is not. But it IS true that Greenland has lost a lot of ice in recent years. In fact, 2012 and 2019 both set records for ice loss within the historical record.",,,,Sea levels are projected to rise by more than 3 feet by the end of the century,"This is only true under a very high global warming scenario (about 4 °C global warming by 2100). For a mitigation scenario in line with the Paris agreement, experts expect a likely range of 30-65 cm rise by 2100 (relative to 1986–2005). See Horton et al. 2020[4].",,,,"Coastal states like Florida, and low-lying island nations are particularly vulnerable. Just 3 feet of sea level rise could put large areas of coastline underwater",This is a completely valid concern. Rising seas already cause major problems and this will get ever worse during the course of this century. The question of whether the Greenland Ice Sheet is doomed to disappear completely in the end or eventually stabilizes at a smaller size concerns the very long term; it has no bearing on what happens in this century.,"It’s useful to note that sea levels will not rise the same everywhere. Some coastal locations will experience much more or less sea level rise than the global average. For example, the U.S. Gulf Coast will experience more sea level rise than the global average.",,,"the ice sheet is retreating in rapid bursts, leading to a sudden and unpredictable rise in sea levels, making it difficult to prepare for the effects","I do not agree with this statement. Ice sheet edge retreat is not a direct measure of ice mass loss. Even if ice edge retreat happens in bursts, we cannot determine from that measure how much total ice will be lost each year. Also, sea level rise is the result of a combination of changes that include land ice melt, ocean heat causing ocean volume to increase, and local vertical land motion. I would argue that the current spread in future projections of sea level rise is not highly influenced by Greenland glacier retreat rates.",,,,Entire coasts of ice are retreating at once due to climate change,Correct. There is widespread retreat of the ice edge around all of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Article by Michael Shellenberger mixes accurate and inaccurate claims in support of a misleading and overly simplistic argumentation about climate change,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-by-michael-shellenberger-mixes-accurate-and-inaccurate-claims-in-support-of-a-misleading-and-overly-simplistic-argumentation-about-climate-change/,"On Behalf Of Environmentalists, I Apologize For The Climate Scare",http://archive.is/fH58q,"On behalf of environmentalists everywhere, I would like to formally apologize for the climate scare we created over the last 30 years. Climate change is happening. It’s just not the end of the world. It’s not even our most serious environmental problem. 
I may seem like a strange person to be saying all of this. I have been a climate activist for 20 years and an environmentalist for 30. 
But as an energy expert asked by Congress to provide objective expert testimony, and invited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to serve as Expert Reviewer of its next Assessment Report, I feel an obligation to apologize for how badly we environmentalists have misled the public.
Here are some facts few people know:
Humans are not causing a “sixth mass extinction” 
The Amazon is not “the lungs of the world”
Climate change is not making natural disasters worse
Fires have declined 25% around the world since 2003
The amount of land we use for meat — humankind’s biggest use of land — has declined by an area nearly as large as Alaska
The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California
Carbon emissions have been declining in rich nations for decades and peaked in Britain, Germany and France in the mid-seventies
Adapting to life below sea level made the Netherlands rich not poor
We produce 25% more food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter
Habitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change
Wood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels
Preventing future pandemics requires more not less “industrial” agriculture
I know that the above facts will sound like “climate denialism” to many people. But that just shows the power of climate alarmism. 
In reality, the above facts come from the best-available scientific studies, including those conducted by or accepted by the IPCC, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and other leading scientific bodies. 
Some people will, when they read this imagine that I’m some right-wing anti-environmentalist. I’m not. At 17, I lived in Nicaragua to show solidarity with the Sandinista socialist revolution. At 23 I raised money for Guatemalan women’s cooperatives. In my early 20s I lived in the semi-Amazon doing research with small farmers fighting land invasions. At 26 I helped expose poor conditions at Nike factories in Asia. 
I became an environmentalist at 16 when I threw a fundraiser for Rainforest Action Network. At 27 I helped save the last unprotected ancient redwoods in California. In my 30s I advocated renewables and successfully helped persuade the Obama administration to invest $90 billion into them. Over the last few years I helped save enough nuclear plants from being replaced by fossil fuels to prevent a sharp increase in emissions 
Until last year, I mostly avoided speaking out against the climate scare. Partly that’s because I was embarrassed. After all, I am as guilty of alarmism as any other environmentalist. For years, I referred to climate change as an “existential” threat to human civilization, and called it a “crisis.” 
But mostly I was scared. I remained quiet about the climate disinformation campaign because I was afraid of losing friends and funding. The few times I summoned the courage to defend climate science from those who misrepresent it I suffered harsh consequences. And so I mostly stood by and did next to nothing as my fellow environmentalists terrified the public.
I even stood by as people in the White House and many in the news media tried to destroy the reputation and career of an outstanding scientist, good man, and friend of mine, Roger Pielke, Jr., a lifelong progressive Democrat and environmentalist who testified in favor of carbon regulations. Why did they do that? Because his research proves natural disasters aren’t getting worse. 
But then, last year, things spiraled out of control. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said “The world is going to end in twelve years if we don’t address climate change.” Britain’s most high-profile environmental group claimed “Climate Change Kills Children.” 
The world’s most influential green journalist, Bill McKibben, called climate change the “greatest challenge humans have ever faced” and said it would “wipe out civilizations.” 
Mainstream journalists reported, repeatedly, that the Amazon was “the lungs of the world,” and that deforestation was like a nuclear bomb going off.
As a result, half of the people surveyed around the world last year said they thought climate change would make humanity extinct. And in January, one out of five British children told pollsters they were having nightmares about climate change.
Whether or not you have children you must see how wrong this is. I admit I may be sensitive because I have a teenage daughter. After we talked about the science she was reassured. But her friends are deeply misinformed and thus, understandably, frightened. 
I thus decided I had to speak out. I knew that writing a few articles wouldn’t be enough. I needed a book to properly lay out all of the evidence. 
 And so my formal apology for our fear-mongering comes in the form of my new book, Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All. 
It is based on two decades of research and three decades of environmental activism. At 400 pages, with 100 of them endnotes, Apocalypse Never covers climate change, deforestation, plastic waste, species extinction, industrialization, meat, nuclear energy, and renewables.
Some highlights from the book:
Factories and modern farming are the keys to human liberation and environmental progress 
The most important thing for saving the environment is producing more food, particularly meat, on less land 
The most important thing for reducing air pollution and carbon emissions is moving from wood to coal to petroleum to natural gas to uranium 
100% renewables would require increasing the land used for energy from today’s 0.5% to 50% 
We should want cities, farms, and power plants to have higher, not lower, power densities
Vegetarianism reduces one’s emissions by less than 4%
Greenpeace didn’t save the whales, switching from whale oil to petroleum and palm oil did
“Free-range” beef would require 20 times more land and produce 300% more emissions
Greenpeace dogmatism worsened forest fragmentation of the Amazon
The colonialist approach to gorilla conservation in the Congo produced a backlash that may have resulted in the killing of 250 elephants
Why were we all so misled?
In the final three chapters of Apocalypse Never I expose the financial, political, and ideological motivations. Environmental groups have accepted hundreds of millions of dollars from fossil fuel interests. Groups motivated by anti-humanist beliefs forced the World Bank to stop trying to end poverty and instead make poverty “sustainable.” And status anxiety, depression, and hostility to modern civilization are behind much of the alarmism
Once you realize just how badly misinformed we have been, often by people with plainly unsavory or unhealthy motivations, it is hard not to feel duped. 
Will Apocalypse Never make any difference? There are certainly reasons to doubt it. 
The news media have been making apocalyptic pronouncements about climate change since the late 1980s, and do not seem disposed to stop. 
The ideology behind environmental alarmsim — Malthusianism — has been repeatedly debunked for 200 years and yet is more powerful than ever.
But there are also reasons to believe that environmental alarmism will, if not come to an end, have diminishing cultural power. 
The coronavirus pandemic is an actual crisis that puts the climate “crisis” into perspective. Even if you think we have overreacted, Covid-19 has killed nearly 500,000 people and shattered economies around the globe.
Scientific institutions including WHO and IPCC have undermined their credibility through the repeated politicization of science. Their future existence and relevance depends on new leadership and serious reform.
Facts still matter, and social media is allowing for a wider range of new and independent voices to outcompete alarmist environmental journalists at legacy publications. 
Nations are reorienting toward the national interest and away from Malthusianism and neoliberalism, which is good for nuclear and bad for renewables.
The evidence is overwhelming that our high-energy civilization is better for people and nature than the low-energy civilization that climate alarmists would return us to. 
And the invitations I received from IPCC and Congress late last year, after I published a series of criticisms of climate alarmism, are signs of a growing openness to new thinking about climate change and the environment.
Another sign is the response to my book from climate scientists, conservationists, and environmental scholars. ""Apocalypse Never is an extremely important book,” writes Richard Rhodes, the Pulitzer-winning author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb. “This may be the most important book on the environment ever written,” says one of the fathers of modern climate science Tom Wigley.
“We environmentalists condemn those with antithetical views of being ignorant of science and susceptible to confirmation bias,” wrote the former head of The Nature Conservancy, Steve McCormick. “But too often we are guilty of the same.  Shellenberger offers ‘tough love:’ a challenge to entrenched orthodoxies and rigid, self-defeating mindsets.  Apocalypse Never serves up occasionally stinging, but always well-crafted, evidence-based points of view that will help develop the ‘mental muscle’ we need to envision and design not only a hopeful, but an attainable, future.”
That is all I that I had hoped for in writing it. If you’ve made it this far, I hope you’ll agree that it’s perhaps not as strange as it seems that a lifelong environmentalist, progressive, and climate activist felt the need to speak out against the alarmism. 
I further hope that you’ll accept my apology.",low,"Cherry-picking, Misleading",6747,"The article by Michael Shellenberger was published in full or in part in various media outlets, including Forbes, Zero Hedge, Breitbart, PJ Media, The Daily Wire, The Australian, and Quillette. The article has been shared more than 200,000 times on social media since it was published, according to Buzzsumo. Forbes unpublished the article on the same day it was published for violating editorial guidelines around self-promotion. In the article, Shellenberger, who is promoting a new book, outlines a series of claims about climate change. As the reviewers describe below, several of these claims are accurate or partially accurate. However, others are inaccurate and mislead readers by lacking context and cherry-picking data while overlooking other relevant scientific studies.
Specifically, Shellenberger claims that “climate change is not making natural disasters worse.” As the reviewers describe below, this claim is inaccurate and contradicts reports from the IPCC as well as numerous scientific studies linking anthropogenic climate change to temperature extremes, drought, precipitation patterns, and wildfires[1-4].

Shellenberger also claims that “Humans are not causing a ‘sixth mass extinction’”. This categorical statement misrepresents the discussion happening in the scientific community. Scientific evidence clearly shows that human activities are driving global species extinctions, and these extinctions are expected to accelerate with continued global warming[5-12]. According to the IPBES, “degradation of the Earth’s land surface through human activities is negatively impacting the well-being of at least 3.2 billion people, pushing the planet towards a sixth mass species extinction.”[10] The IPBES 2018 report also states, “It has been proposed that we are in a sixth mass extinction of the Earth’s species, following five others in the past 540 million years[5,13,14]. There are an accumulating number of studies that almost universally support this conclusion, although often with caveats owing to the paucity of data.” As described in Ceballos et al. (2015), “conservatively almost 200 species of vertebrates have gone extinct in the last 100 years.”[5] This result contrasts with the estimated background extinction rate, which would take approximately 10,000 years for 200 vertebrate species to go extinct. So clearly, the possibility that human activities are causing a mass extinction is being actively discussed by scientists, both with regards to current conditions and future trends, including global warming that is expected to accelerate species extinction rates[10,12].

Scientists who reviewed this article also noted several misleading claims about wildfires, including “fires have declined 25% around the world since 2003,” and “The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California.” Although global burned area declined ~25% from 1998-2015, this is driven in part by non-climatic factors, such as clearing land for agriculture[15,16]. By conflating purposefully set fires and wildfires as well as climatic and non-climatic factors driving these fires, the claim relies on flawed reasoning to suggest that wildfires are not affected by climate change. These claims also contradict scientific studies showing that anthropogenic climate change has increased fire risk in the western U.S. and Canada[17-19].

The reviewers who analyzed this article rated its overall credibility to be low. In their comments below, the scientists evaluate many of these claims and describe how they are inaccurate or mislead readers by contradicting available evidence or using scientific data out of context.",,,,,"Zeke Hausfather, Director of Climate and Energy, The Breakthrough Institute","Shellenberger’s article promoting his new book “Apocalypse Never” includes a mix of accurate, misleading, and patently false statements. While it is useful to push back against claims that climate change will lead to the end of the world or human extinction, to do so by inaccurately downplaying real climate risks is deeply problematic and counterproductive.

Shellenberger’s claims that climate plays no role in natural disasters and wildfires fly in the face of a large peer-reviewed scientific literature showing clear links between climate change and extreme heat events, drought, and extreme rainfall as well as links between hotter and drier conditions and wildfire areas burned in many regions of the world[1-4].

Shellenberger also falls into the trap of seeing a single technology (nuclear) as the one true solution to climate change, and mistakenly sees denigrating other clean energy technologies as the best way to promote it. The real world involves messy trade-offs and uncertainties, and decarbonization will involve a range of different technological solutions across industries and geographies rather than a single panacea.

For more details on each, see my comments below.","Stefan Doerr, Professor, Swansea University","The article argues that society has been misled about causes and consequences of climate change, which has led to “climate alarmism.” The author advocates that we should be less concerned about climate change than many environmentalists argue. Whilst the latter is relative depending on how concerned an individual is and which specific (and perhaps extreme) view this aligns with, some of the supporting statements in the article related to wildfire are (i) inaccurate for key facts supporting argumentation, or (ii) omit important information that leads to flaws in the conclusions.

“Climate change is not making natural disasters worse”.

This is incorrect for wildfires. Several global climate trends promote fire: increased temperature, frequency, intensity and/or extent of heatwaves, droughts and extreme winds. This is very well established and summarised in the IPCC (2014) report[1,2].

“Fires have declined 25% around the world since 2003″.

It is correct that the total global area burned has OVERALL declined over the last decades, BUT this is incorrectly used to argue that climate change is not affecting wildfires. The overall decrease is largely due a substantial reduction in flammable vegetation in African grasslands arising from human land use changes. Climate change has led to an increase in area burned in regions where fires burn more intensely and have a greater impact (e.g. western USA and Canada)[18,19]. This is omitted, leading to a false perception.

“The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California”.

Partially correct[17], but the assertion that the climate change related factors outlined above do not also contribute to increasingly “dangerous fires” is fundamentally flawed. It is comparable to suggesting that smoking alone and not obesity is responsible for an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Both factors are clearly important.
","Daniel Swain, Climate Scientist, University of California, Los Angeles","The article presents a mix of out-of-context facts and outright falsehoods to reach conclusions that are, collectively, fundamentally misleading. The author claims to reference specific sources, including “the IPCC, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), [and] the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).” However, the author’s claims are broadly unsupported by any of these authoritative bodies[1].","Gerardo Ceballos, Professor, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","This is not a scientific paper. It is intended, I guess, to be an article for the general public. Unfortunately, it is neither. It does not have a logical structure that allows the reader to understand what he would like to address, aside from a very general and misleading idea that environmentalists and climate scientists have been alarmist in relation to climate change. He lists a series of eclectic environmental problems like the Sixth Mass Extinction, green energy, and climate disruption. And without any data nor any proof, he discredits the idea that those are human-caused, severe environmental problems. He just mentions loose ideas about why he is right and the rest of the scientists, environmentalists, and general public are wrong. Being objective, this is a really bad article. It will cause confusion among the public—perhaps that is his idea.

He indicates, with no data, that we are not in the Sixth Mass Extinction. I will explain here why he is wrong. For a long time, we have been aware that our activities have caused the extinction of many species. The case of the dodo, the first human-caused extinction in modern times (1600 AD) is relatively well-known for the general public[5]. In the last decade, there has been a plethora of scientific studies that have carefully analyzed the current extinction rates and have compared them with the natural or background rates occurring in the last million years[6-8]. Evolution of life proceeds as a dynamic balance of the extinction and speciation processes. While some species become extinct others are generated by speciation events. Under normal times, when Earth is not suffering a global catastrophe, the normal extinction rate is called the “background extinction rate.” However, in the last 600 million years life has experienced 5 mass extinctions, where most species on Earth have disappeared. These mass extinctions were each caused by a natural catastrophe, such as a meteorite, or happened over thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, causing the extinction of 70 to 90% of all living species.

In 2015, I showed with my colleagues from the National Autonomous University of Mexico and Stanford University that we have entered the Sixth Mass Extinction (see figure below)[5].

The 543 species of vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes) that were lost over the last 120 years would have become extinct in 10,000 years under the background extinction rates prevailing in the last million years. In other words, in the last century we lost in one year the same number of species that would have been lost in 100 years!

We and other scientific groups have also shown that the extinction crisis is more severe because hundreds of millions of populations of animals and plants have disappeared in the last 40 years[5-9].

Those extinctions are accelerating, threatening the ecosystems that support life on Earth. If the current extinction crisis continues unchecked, we will lose entire ecosystems and the critical services they provide, including the proper combination of the gases of the atmosphere that make life on Earth possible, provision of fresh water, pollination and pest and disease control[8].","Jennifer Francis, Senior Scientist, Woods Hole Research Center","Many statements are half-truths or based on cherry-picked information. Some are outright false. For example, it’s ludicrous to state “climate change is not making natural disasters worse.” An abundant and rapidly growing body of peer-reviewed scientific research identifies numerous ways that climate change is increasing the likelihood and intensity of various extreme weather events, exacerbating coastal flooding, and destroying ecological systems[1,2,6,18,19].

“Humans are not causing a ‘sixth mass extinction’”

An exceptionally rapid loss of species is occurring and expected to continue. Climate change is not the only factor responsible—pollution, habitat deterioration, over fishing and hunting, and invasive species are also contributing. Human fingerprints are all over these factors[5-14].

“Climate change is not making natural disasters worse”

This statement is refuted by numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies[1-4]. While disasters related to non-climate-change events (such as volcanoes, earthquakes, tsunamis) have not increased in frequency, those associated with climate change have tripled in frequency since the 1980s (see figure below).

“Fires have declined 25% around the world since 2003”

This is true in terms of a global average, mainly because forests have been cut down and replaced with agricultural land and because of fire suppression activities[15]. Some areas, however, are experiencing more frequent, larger, and more damaging fires—such as the U.S. western states, Alaska, northern Canada, and northern Eurasia[18,19]. This statement is misleading at best.

“Carbon emissions are declining in most rich nations and have been declining in Britain, Germany, and France since the mid-1970s”

This is true, but it’s in large part because high-emission industries have been moved to developing countries. Global carbon emissions are still increasing steadily (see figure below).

“The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California”

Both factors are contributing to increased fires[16].","Ryan Sriver, Associate Professor, University of Illinois","First off, it is largely an opinion piece and many of the claims are unverifiable or written in a way that is misleading, such as: “Fires have declined 25% around the world since 2003”. What exactly does this mean, the number of fires, duration, area burned, etc.?

Another such misleading claim is “Climate change is not making natural disasters worse”. Again, what natural disasters is the author referring to with this blanket statement, and what time frame, the last 5 years, 20 years, 100 years? The claim is vague and misleading in particular for climate and weather extremes. Temperature and precipitation extremes are getting worse with global warming leading to more severe and widespread heatwaves and drought[1-4]. This is well documented in the community assessments and observations, such as the 4th National Climate Assessment[20]. In addition, oceans are getting warmer and the atmosphere is wetter, which—combined with global sea-level rise—is making the flooding and precipitation damages from tropical cyclones and hurricanes more severe[1,2,21,22].

Finally, there is essentially no mention of arguably the biggest risk of climate change: sea-level rise!  The only statement I see is the claim: “Adapting to life below sea level made the Netherlands rich not poor.” This statement acknowledges that sea-level rise is indeed happening and that adaptation will make nations better off economically. Statements such as these are dangerous and misleading. Sea-level rise poses a major threat to coastal communities with global socio-economic implications, and we are already seeing the negative impacts in more frequent and severe flood events in the US. These damages will only worsen as the polar ice sheets continue to melt, with potentially catastrophic effects on coastal cities and ecosystems, real estate markets, insurance industries, human migration, and national security.","Kerry Emanuel, Professor of Atmospheric Science, MIT","In his article, Michael Shellenberger claims that “climate change is not making natural disasters worse”. This begs the question of what exactly is meant by “natural disasters”, but no matter how one defines them, this statement is patently false.

Let us assume that Shellenberger is defining natural disasters as deaths from events that could conceivably have a climate connection, such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes. In the period between 1900 and 2020, global deaths from these disasters have declined steeply. There is little question about why this has happened, and it is the immensely gratifying effects of greatly improved warnings, evacuations, and resilience. For example, in Bangladesh, where a single storm killed as many as 500,000 people in 1970, the government and non-governmental organizations have built many emergency evacuations shelters that have saved arguably millions of people in subsequent cyclones that have been meteorologically as bad or worse.

If there is a climate change signal, it would appear as a lessening of this happy trend toward decreased fatalities, but it would be very difficult if not impossible to extract such a signal. We do not know from this data whether climate change is decreasing the rate of decline of deaths from natural disasters or not.

If, on the other hand, we look at economic damage, normalized by world domestic product, the signal is equally clear but in the other direction….damages from weather-related natural disasters have been increasing greatly. One could plausibly argue that this is because of a global migration toward risky coastal regions, and so it is not unequivocal that this increase is owing to climate change.

The cleanest way to look at climate effects on natural phenomena is to look at the phenomena themselves. Here there is strong and mounting evidence that climate change is increasing precipitation extremes (floods and droughts), conditions for wildfires, and the incidence of strong hurricanes[1,2].

Whichever way one looks at it, Shellenberger’s statement is not defensible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,as an energy expert…invited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to serve as Expert Reviewer of its next Assessment Report,This credential sounds much more impressive than it actually is. Anyone who wants to can sign up as an expert reviewer for the IPCC.,,,,The Amazon is not “the lungs of the world”,"While this phrase was inaccurately spread in some news stories earlier this year, climate scientists – and the majority of activists – have never claimed this to be the case.

There is, however, a real danger that a combination of logging and climate change could transition much of the Amazon to a savannah-like ecosystem this century[23,24].",,,,Climate change is not making natural disasters worse,"On the whole, this claim is incorrect. While there are clearly certain types of natural disasters unaffected by climate change (earthquakes and volcanic activity, for example), and certain kinds of disasters for which there is an absence of evidence regarding a detectable influence from climate change (tornadoes, for example), there is a long and growing list of extreme event/disasters types regarding which the scientific literature strongly supports links to climate change. These include, but are not limited to: extreme heatwave intensity and frequency, drought intensity, wildfire extent and severity, and the flood hazards associated with tropical cyclones/hurricanes (both from oceanic storm surge and freshwater flooding associated with heavy precipitation).","This is patently false. While there are some types of natural disasters with no (volcanoes, earthquakes) or very limited (tornadoes) climate links, others such as extreme heat events, droughts, and extreme rainfall have clear attribution to climate changes.

The US National Academy of Science published a report in 2016 on the role of climate change in extreme events that is quite helpful in understanding where linkages are – and are not – well understood[2]. This figure from the report shows our understanding and attribution of climate change impacts on extreme events, by event type.","I cannot speak to this specific statistic, but I emphasize that it is largely irrelevant in context and certainly misleading, since it conflates both climate and non-climate related factors.

There are strong links between climate change and wildfire extent and severity in many regions globally. It’s less clear whether there are links between climate change and wildfire frequency, but that’s not really the relevant metric here. Instead, climate change is clearly modulating the characteristics of wildfire in many regions—broadly increasing the dryness and flammability of vegetation, and allowing fires to become more intense and to burn more extensive areas.","This statement is accurate but misleading. The vast majority of fires globally are purposefully set for agricultural clearing, and these have declined in recent years. Conflating all fires with forest and wildfires – as Shellenberger does – is not helpful in understanding changing drivers of fire risk.

A 2014 study in the Journal of Geophysical Research by Dr. Jia Yang at Auburn University and colleagues suggests that in the tropics climate change may have also reduced the area burned over the past 50 years, due, in part, to wetter conditions[25]. However, they find that climate change has likely increased fire risk in the high latitudes and mid-latitudes over recent decades.

Hotter and dryer conditions have been a major factor in the increase in areas burned by wildfires in many regions – such as the western US – in recent years.",The amount of land we use for meat — humankind’s biggest use of land — has declined by an area nearly as large as Alaska,"This statement is accurate (according to FAO data) and represents an important decoupling of land use and livestock production in spite of increasing global meat consumption – though some of the reduction is offset by increased land use for agricultural crops for animal feed.

That said, there are large climate impacts of meat consumption apart from land use, and growing meat consumption is still driving deforestation in areas like the Amazon even as overall pasture use shrinks. So while peak pasture is certainly a positive thing, it does not translate into notable reductions in emissions to-date, as emissions from land use changes have remained largely unchanged. It does not – as Shellenberger seems to suggest – in any way indicate that climate change is a less serious problem than commonly thought, just that it’s possible to mitigate our impacts by changing practices and technologies.",,,,"The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California","This is misleading and incorrect as stated. While the legacy of 20th century forest management policies, as well as urban incursion into the wildlands, are indeed relevant in some areas, research has shown that such non-climate factors cannot account for the enormous increase in area burned by wildfire both in the broader American West and California specifically.

In fact, drying of vegetation due to climate change is responsible for about half of the observed increase in western U.S. forest fire area burned over the past several decades[18]. More specifically in California, observed warming and drying more than doubled the occurrence of extreme fire weather conditions between 1979 and 2018—a trend that is attributable to human-caused climate change[19].","Here Shellenberger sets up a false dichotomy. All three factors – buildup of vegetation due to fire suppression, more people living in the wildland-urban interface, and hotter and dryer conditions have contributed to severe wildfires in regions like the western US in recent years.

For example, there is a strong year-to-year relationship between fuel aridity – driven by hotter and dryer conditions – and area burned in the western US.

A 2016 study showed that climate change is responsible for over half the increase in fuel aridity (drier fuel load), and has doubled the cumulative forest area burned[18]. Rising average global temperatures have led to higher spring and summer temperatures, which in turn have led to earlier spring snowmelt. Further, there is evidence that climate change is causing winter rains to come later in autumn, and stop earlier in spring[26,27]. This is extending the area and time periods in which forests become combustible, and in parts of California, fire season is now 50 days longer than in 1979[28,29].",,,"Carbon emissions are declining in most rich nations and have been declining in Britain, Germany, and France since the mid-1970s","This claim substantially overstates the long-term success that rich countries have had in decarbonizing their economies. Rich nations as a whole (using OECD nations as the grouping of rich countries) emit 25% more CO2 today than they did in the mid 1970s. While a number of countries (Germany, France, UK) do emit less today than in the 1970s, their experience is not generalizable to rich countries as a whole.

These calculations also do not include emissions associated with increased consumption of goods produced in places like China, which matters quite a bit in recent decades.

OECD emissions as a whole have declined around 10% since 2007, with 18 (of 37) OECD countries experiencing sustained reductions in emissions. This is encouraging progress, and shows that absolute decoupling (growing economy with falling emissions) is possible – even taking changes in consumption-based emissions into account.",,,,Wood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels,"Shellenberger is correct here that burning wood in cookstoves in the developing world is terrible for the climate, human health, and nature. Replacing it with fossil fuels – or even better, grid-connected electricity – is an important step in reducing indoor air pollution and black carbon emissions.

To the extent that modern biomass is used to replace fossil fuels for electricity generation, it is quite controversial and opposed by most environmental advocates. It also represents only a small fraction of the clean energy added globally each year – the vast majority of which is from solar, wind, and nuclear.",,,,Preventing future pandemics requires more not less “industrial” agriculture,"There is broad agreement in the epidemiological and virological studies of zoonoses that the most important factor in the development of new zoonotic diseases is land-use change.

To the extent that agricultural intensification reduces pressure on wildlands, it can help reduce risk of future pandemics.",,,,"As a result, half of the people surveyed around the world last year said they thought climate change would make humanity extinct.

Article in The Guardian misleads readers about sensitivity of climate models by narrowly focusing on single study,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-in-the-guardian-misleads-readers-about-sensitivity-of-climate-models-by-narrowly-focusing-on-single-study-jonathan-watts/,"Climate worst-case scenarios may not go far enough, cloud data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/13/climate-worst-case-scenarios-clouds-scientists-global-heating,"Worst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds, scientists have said.

Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed, and experts said the projections had the potential to be “incredibly alarming”, though they stressed further research would be needed to validate the new numbers.

Modelling results from more than 20 institutions are being compiled for the sixth assessment by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is due to be released next year.

Compared with the last assessment in 2014, 25% of them show a sharp upward shift from 3C to 5C in climate sensitivity – the amount of warming projected from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from the preindustrial level of 280 parts per million. This has shocked many veteran observers, because assumptions about climate sensitivity have been relatively unchanged since the 1980s.

“That is a very deep concern,” Johan Rockström, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said. “Climate sensitivity is the holy grail of climate science. It is the prime indicator of climate risk. For 40 years, it has been around 3C. Now, we are suddenly starting to see big climate models on the best supercomputers showing things could be worse than we thought.”

He said climate sensitivity above 5C would reduce the scope for human action to reduce the worst impacts of global heating. “We would have no more space for a soft landing of 1.5C [above preindustrial levels]. The best we could aim for is 2C,” he said.

Worst-case projections in excess of 5C have been generated by several of the world’s leading climate research bodies, including the UK Met Office’s Hadley Centre and the EU’s Community Earth System Model.

Timothy Palmer, a professor in climate physics at Oxford University and a member of the Met Office’s advisory board, said the high figure initially made scientists nervous. “It was way outside previous estimates. People asked whether there was a bug in the code,” he said. “But it boiled down to relatively small changes in the way clouds are represented in the models.”

The role of clouds is one of the most uncertain areas in climate science because they are hard to measure and, depending on altitude, droplet temperature and other factors, can play either a warming or a cooling role. For decades, this has been the focus of fierce academic disputes.

Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out. But in the past year and a half, a body of evidence has been growing showing that the net effect will be warming. This is based on finer resolution computer models and advanced cloud microphysics.

“Clouds will determine humanity’s fate – whether climate is an existential threat or an inconvenience that we will learn to live with,” said Palmer. “Most recent models suggest clouds will make matters worse.”

In a recent paper in the journal Nature, Palmer explains how the new Hadley Centre model that produced the 5+C figure on climate sensitivity was tested by assessing its accuracy in forecasting short-term weather. This testing technique had exposed flaws in previous models, but in the latest case, the results reinforced the estimates. “The results are not reassuring – they support the estimates,” he wrote. He is calling for other models to be tested in a similar way.

“It’s really important. The message to the government and public is, you have to take this high climate sensitivity seriously. [We] must get emissions down as quickly as we can,” he said.

The IPCC is expected to include the 5+C climate sensitivity figure in its next report on the range of possible outcomes. Scientists caution that this is a work in progress and that doubts remain because such a high figure does not fit with historical records.

Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols.

“This figure has the potential to be incredibly alarming if it is right,” she said. “But as a scientist, my first response is: why has the model done that? We are still in the stage of evaluating the processes driving the different response.”

While acknowledging the continued uncertainty, Rockström said climate models might still be underestimating the problem because they did not fully take into account tipping points in the biosphere.

“The more we learn, the more fragile the Earth system seems to be and the faster we need to move,” he said. “It gives even stronger argument to step out of this Covid-19 crisis and move full speed towards decarbonising the economy.”",low,"Cherry-picking, Exaggerating, Misleading",846,"The article in The Guardian misleadingly claims that the latest generation of climate models are more sensitive to carbon emissions than scientists previously thought. Instead, reviewers of this article state that the best estimate of climate sensitivity, or the amount that global temperature rises in response to increased CO2, remains within the range presented in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report[1]. Some updated climate models have exhibited higher climate sensitivities, but research so far suggests that is unlikely to be accurate.

Several reviewers stated that the article is based on one model that showed high climate sensitivity (described in a news commentary in Nature[2,3]), while overlooking the model’s limitations. As the reviewers explain below, the model performed well in short-term forecasts, but did not accurately simulate the global warming trend over the last century (see figure below)[4].

Although the article in the Guardian mentions that scientists are still evaluating this model, the headline and introduction mislead readers by stating that “climate worst-case scenarios may not go far enough,” and that projections of the future “may need to be revised.” These claims overstate scientific confidence in the new models. More broadly, the article overlooks other climate models and scientific research on climate sensitivity and how it is influenced by clouds[5-7].",,,,,"Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of Exeter","Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is a very important topic of great interest, but also complex and still subject to considerable uncertainty and ongoing research. The article does recognise the uncertainty in the latest models and quotes a leading scientist in this regard, but the headline and first two sentences overstate the scientific confidence and give the impression of a more substantial update to scientific understanding than is actually the case. The caveat in the second sentence reads as if the high ECS in the new models is provisionally accepted and merely needs further checking, rather than being something that the modellers are not yet sure about either way. The article is not clear on the uncertainty in the previous estimates of ECS and gives the impression that there was previously a fairly precise estimate of “around 3°C”, but in fact that was already fairly uncertain, as explained by the IPCC[1]. The latest research would be more accurately characterised as still not yet ruling out high climate sensitivity that was previously thought possible but relatively unlikely, rather than suggesting that high climate sensitivity is now more likely than previously believed.","Mark Richardson, Research Associate, Colorado State University/NASA JPL","This article’s main theme is broadly accurate. Many new climate models, which better fit satellite cloud measurements, have a high value of “climate sensitivity.” It includes important doubts about how “such a high figure does not fit with historical records”.

Technical errors like confusing the national origin of a model and the description of a provided percentage don’t affect these main conclusions.

Readers should be aware that this article is slanted to the “shock” and “surprise” of these results and misses context from past work, such as the uncertainty ranges provided in past UN climate reports. However, the article is clear about these being mostly model results, reports how only around a quarter of these new models show very high sensitivity, and mentions the counterbalance of evidence from the historical record. Taken together I mark this article as “accurate”, with elements that are “exaggerating” and “imprecise/unclear”.","Reto Knutti, Professor, ETH Zürich","The main problem with this Guardian article is not incorrect statements, but that it is cherry picking one single result, misinterpreting it, surround it by strong quotes from people who have no expertise in that area, thereby painting a doomsday scenario (“modelling suggests climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than thought”) that is highly misleading and completely unsupported by the evidence.

The oversimplification is in two steps, the first in a Nature comment on the original paper[3]. Here Tim Palmer is incorrect in saying that the results of the original paper “support the estimates [for climate sensitivity]”[2,3]. The fact that the new high climate sensitivity model does well on six hour forecasts does not imply a) that the model is fine in general, and does not imply b) that it is the only model that is capable of doing that. The relationship between short-term forecasts and climate feedbacks is not demonstrated, and the evidence from hundreds of other papers on the topic is ignored.

On a) the agreement on short-term forecasts simply means that this model is doing this particular thing well. However, this particular model is one of the two worst in simulating the warming over the past 40 years. It shows basically no warming globally until 1980 or 1990, even cooling over land, and a massive surge after about 1990[4]. The details are likely complicated, but are probably related to too-strong feedbacks (high climate sensitivity), compensated by too strong aerosol cooling until 1990, a hypothesis put forward ages ago in energy balance models. Indeed the Guardian piece mentions that, but only briefly at the end.

On b) as pointed out by others, nobody has demonstrated that the high sensitivity is related to short-term forecast skill in these newer models. Everything is different in the new model, so the improvement may have come from some other change. One would have to demonstrate that many versions of that model with low climatology are doing significantly worse on short-term forecasts, and would have to demonstrate that this is also true for models from other centers.

The fact that one particular test cannot rule out a high climate sensitivity does not make it likely. It simply means that we do not know. But there are other lines of evidence that point to the canonical 2-4.5°C range. One is the recent warming since 1950 or so, the other is paleoclimate estimates, the third is process understanding and feedback estimates from cloud data and surface observations

We and others have shown recently that almost all of the high climate sensitivity models in fact tend to overestimate recent warming[5], the Met Office model being one of the two worst, and taking that into account suggests that many of the new CMIP6 models are biased high, and that future warming is similar to what it was in earlier models. While it is correct that we are seeing models with high climate sensitivity, the evidence is growing that there are issues with at least some of these models.

In summary, the Guardian article is cherry-picking a single technical paper and over-interpreting it as being relevant for the prediction of long term warming, without sufficient context on the vast amount of literature that does not support such a conclusion.
","Joeri Rogelj, Research Scholar, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)","The article correctly reports that the most recent versions of some climate models estimate more warming for a given increase in CO2 concentrations. It is also correct in highlighting that how clouds are represented in these models is the likely reason for these higher estimates. However, it does not report all the science available on this topic and its claims are thus misleading. The article suggests that the only information currently available from scientific studies is that things look much worse, and that otherwise more research is needed to understand whether this is really the case. However, available studies that have looked at what these new model projections mean have found that models with higher warming are worse in capturing global warming trends over the past decades, making their projections of very high warming less probable[4]. This is important context that was omitted from the article.","Paulo Ceppi, Lecturer, Imperial College London","The article suggests that new modelling results have led scientists to revise their understanding of the role of clouds for climate change. This is misleading. Current scientific consensus is that clouds will amplify warming, but most evidence does not point towards an extreme amplifying effect. So while extreme high warming scenarios cannot be entirely ruled out, there is no convincing evidence that the amplifying effect of clouds is stronger than we previously thought.

While the new Nature paper cited in the article is thought-provoking[2], its significance is overstated, and the paper should have been discussed in the context of other recent evidence that does not support the high-sensitivity modelling results.","Piers Forster, Professor, University of Leeds","In this article there is some science on the latest climate models and their cloud feedbacks that have been reported before. However, quotes by Rockstrom and the writer [Watts] are unsupported opinions that make misleading interpretations of the new science that warming will be worse than we thought. These claims are not supported by other lines of evidence showing our estimates of warming rates have been stable over time.","Mark Zelinka, Research Scientist, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","I would characterize the article as overstating the importance of a single result from a single model without sufficient context. A highly sensitive model might have a great-looking climatological state and perform really well on short-term weather forecasts, but even a broken clock is right twice a day. This is hyperbole of course: This is an excellent model and by no means “broken”, but it remains to be rigorously shown that this model is giving a more accurate picture of our future than what we previously thought. More generally, the consequences of continued greenhouse gas emissions are dire enough if climate sensitivity is in line with the existing scientific consensus; whether this new more sensitive model is more accurate is mostly immaterial to that fact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Worst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds, scientists have said.”",This appears to be based on the view of a scientist who was not involved in developing the new models. A quote later in the article shows that a scientist with a leading role in the latest models is much more cautious and said it needs more research before conclusions can be drawn.,"There is no consensus in the community what these would be. Different scientists have different views, so there is no standard worst-case scenario to revise, see our CCC blog.",,,“Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed”,"This statement is not correct. Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) has always been quite uncertain, and the high values in the new models are within the range previously thought possible, although relatively unlikely. A value of around 5°C in some of the CMIP6 models is outside the “likely range” of ECS assessed in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5), but it is still not in the AR5 “very unlikely” range of above 6°C[1]. The recent studies cited in this report conclude that the high ECS values cannot be ruled out by the methods used in those studies, but they do not conclude that high ECS is more likely than previously believed.",The latest models might also be over sensitive[6].,,,“25% of them show a sharp upward shift from 3C to 5C in climate sensitivity”,"It’s not clear what this statement is based on, as no source is given. Although several CMIP6 models produce an ECS above the upper end of the range of the CMIP5 models, this range was 1.2°C – 4.7°C so it is not clear where the description of a shift from 3°C to 5°C comes from.","I don’t see where this statement comes from either. The top 25% of models out now have climate sensitivity of about 4.8°C or above, so one part of this statement gives a broadly accurate summary. But several of those are new versions of models that previously had climate sensitivity quite a bit higher than 3°C, so there wasn’t a “shift” of those models.",,,"“For 40 years, it has been around 3C”","Actually the estimates of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) have long been around 1.5°C – 4.5°C, with higher values still thought possible. The IPCC 5th Assessment Report judged that there was up to a 10% chance of ECS being greater than 6°C, and the likelihood of an ECS of 5°C was assessed as less than 33% but more than 10%[1].","I completely agree with Richard Betts, and in fact the latest models agree very well with this range of ECS in general[6].",,,"“He said climate sensitivity above 5C would reduce the scope for human action to reduce the worst impacts of global heating. “We would have no more space for a soft landing of 1.5C [above preindustrial levels]. The best we could aim for is 2C,” he said.”","This is a fair interpretation of the consequences: climate sensitivity of 5°C would make it almost impossible to achieve the stated temperature targets.

But there is still plenty of evidence for climate sensitivity being in the historically likely 1.5 – 4.5°C range, so this should be kept in mind.",,,,“the EU’s Community Earth System Model”,"The Community Earth System Model is from US institutions, but it’s accurate to say that it’s from “leading research bodies” and has a high climate sensitivity.",,,,“Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out.”,"“Assume” is ungenerous—this was based on calculations using physics and the available observations. For example, in 2007 they looked at how climate model clouds affected their climate sensitivity and talked about a “very large inter-model spread”, i.e., you could get net warming or cooling, and we didn’t have the information to rule out either[8].","IPCC does not “assume”, they quantify based on observations and models. And while cloud feedbacks are uncertain, in 2013 the conclusion was already that the overall effect was likely positive (i.e., contributing to warming), specifically only 17% probability for it being negative (cooling).[1]

IPCC AR5 WG1 page 592: “Based on the preceding synthesis of cloud behaviour, the net radia­tive feedback due to all cloud types is judged likely to be positive. This is reasoned probabilistically as follows. First, because evidence from observations and process models is mixed as to whether GCM cloud feedback is too strong or too weak overall, and because the positive feedback found in GCMs comes mostly from mechanisms now sup­ported by other lines of evidence, the central (most likely) estimate of the total cloud feedback is taken as the mean from GCMs (+0.6 W m–2 °C–1). Second, because there is no accepted basis to discredit individual GCMs a priori, the probability distribution of the true feedback cannot be any narrower than the distribution of GCM results. Third, since feed­back mechanisms are probably missing from GCMs and some CRMs suggest feedbacks outside the range in GCMs, the probable range of the feedback must be broader than its spread in GCMs. We estimate a probability distribution for this feedback by doubling the spread about the mean of all model values in Figure 7.10 (in effect assuming an additional uncertainty about 1.7 times as large as that encapsu­lated in the GCM range, added to it in quadrature). This yields a 90% (very likely) range of −0.2 to +2.0 W m–2 °C–1, with a 17% probability of a negative feedback.”[1]",,,"“But in the past year and a half, a body of evidence has been growing showing that the net effect will be warming. This is based on finer resolution computer models and advanced cloud microphysics.”","I think this is generally fair: the available satellite data in particular have shown that clouds seem to act in a way that coincides with higher climate sensitivity.

The fusion of satellite data with climate models has been vital for this.",,,,“Scientists caution that this is a work in progress and that doubts remain because such a high figure does not fit with historical records.”,"It’s correct to have included this, but the message here seems less confident than that conveyed by the headline and opening sentence.",,,,"“Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols. “This figure has the potential to be incredibly alarming if it is right,” she said. “But as a scientist, my first response is: why has the model done that? We are still in the stage of evaluating the processes driving the different response.”","It’s correct to have included this statement from a leading authority on the new models, but the headline and opening sentence of the article do not reflect the caution given here.",,,,"“The more we learn, the more fragile the Earth system seems to be and the faster we need to move,” he said. “It gives even stronger argument to step out of this Covid-19 crisis and move full speed towards decarbonising the economy.”","In fact the more we learn, quite often we find that nature is quite robust, even when trying our best to destroy it, see our CCC blog.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Video from PragerU makes several incorrect and misleading claims about climate change,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/video-from-prageru-makes-several-incorrect-and-misleading-claims-about-climate-change-richard-lindzen/,Climate Change: What Do Scientists Say,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3169298993112935,"I’m an atmospheric physicist. I’ve published more than 200 scientific papers. For 30 years
I taught at MIT, during which time the climate has changed remarkably little. But the cry
of “global warming” has grown ever more shrill. In fact, it seems that the less the climate
changes, the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get. So, let’s clear the air and create a
more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or, as it is now
called—“climate change.”
There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue. Groups one and two are
scientists. Group three consists mostly, at its core, of politicians, environmentalists and the
media.
Group one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation’s International Panel
on Climate Change or IPCC (Working Group 1). These are scientists who mostly believe that
recent climate change is primarily due to man’s burning of fossil fuels—oil, coal and natural
gas. This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might
eventually dangerously heat the planet.
Group two is made up of scientists who don’t see this as an especially serious problem. This
is the group I belong to. We’re usually referred to as skeptics.
We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes—the sun, clouds, oceans,
the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully
understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor.
But actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are
such points of agreement:
1) The climate is always changing.
2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the
atmosphere should lead to some warming.
3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the
19th century.
4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased
slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since
the 1960’s have man’s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role.
5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean
temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC acknowledged in its own 2007 report that
“The long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.”
Most importantly, the scenario that the burning of fossil fuel leads to catastrophe isn’t part of
what either group asserts. So why are so many people worried, indeed, panic stricken about
this issue. Here’s where Group Three comes in—the politicians, environmentalists, and media.
Global warming alarmism provides them, more than any other issue, with the things they
most want: For politicians it’s money and power. For environmentalists it’s money for their
organizations and confirmation of their near religious devotion to the idea that man is a
destructive force acting upon nature. And for the media it’s ideology, money, and headlines.
Doomsday scenarios sell.
Meanwhile, over the last decade, scientists outside of climate physics have jumped on the
bandwagon, publishing papers blaming global warming for everything from acne to the Syrian
civil war. And crony capitalists have eagerly grabbed for the subsidies that governments have
so lavishly provided.
Unfortunately, group three is winning the argument because they have drowned out the
serious debate that should be going on. But while politicians, environmentalists and media
types can waste a lot of money and scare a lot of people, they won’t be able to bury the truth.
The climate will have the final word on that.

",very_low,"Inaccurate, Misleading",763,"This video discussing climate change was first published on PragerU’s website in April 2016 and recently posted on Facebook in May 2020. The video has received more than 356,000 views on Facebook over the past week. Scientists that evaluated the video found several claims about climate change to be incorrect and misleading to viewers.

In the video, former MIT Professor Richard Lindzen claims “there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor” in climate change. This is false. Human-caused increases in CO2 emissions have been the primary driver of climate change[1,2]. Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are higher today than they have been in at least the past 800,000 years[1,2].

Human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols account for approximately 100% of the global warming trend observed since 1950 (see figure below)[3].

Lindzen also misleadingly claims that over the past 30 years, “the climate has changed remarkably little,” but does not specify what “little” is relative to. As described by a reviewer below, a figure of what appears to be global monthly temperature anomalies from 1997 to 2016 is shown to support this claim, although the y-axis is not labeled. This subset of temperature data is cherry-picked from the full record of global monthly temperature anomalies, and therefore misleads the viewer about the degree of global warming that has occurred. The full record of global monthly temperature anomalies shows a clear pattern of global warming from the late 1800s to 2019 (see figure below). There is also scientific evidence that “the warmest period of the past two millennia occurred during the twentieth century for more than 98 percent of the globe”[4].

Another misleading claim made in the video is that “CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on Earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming.” Even though CO2 is important for life on Earth, increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2 have imbalanced the global carbon cycle and caused a range of harmful effects including trends in weather extremes, ocean acidification, and other impacts on land and marine ecosystems[5-8].

Overall, several claims made in the video about climate change are incorrect, not supported by scientific evidence, or misleading to the viewer, as the reviewers detail below.",,,,,"Katrin Meissner, Professor, University of New South Wales","If you watched this video, you have unfortunately wasted 5 minutes of your day. Richard Lindzen is reiterating a few wrong statements on climate change that have been debunked repeatedly in the past (e.g. “there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor” of climate change)[1,2]. He is also very skilled at presenting a few statements on climate change that are right in a misleading way, so that the overall message becomes wrong (“climate is always changing”, “there are many reasons why the climate changes”). He misrepresents the way the IPCC works. He also claims that there is a significant number of specialists (a whole “group”) sharing his “understanding” of climate science, which is also not true.","Patrick Brown, Assistant Professor, San Jose State University","There are many inaccuracies contained within the video in question. The text below deals with just the first one of them.

At the 8 second mark, Dr. Lindzen claims that the climate has changed “remarkably little” over the past 30 years without any reference to what “remarkably little” is relative to. When put in proper context, it is not true that the climate has changed “remarkably little” over the past 30 years.

Over the past 30 years, the global average temperature has warmed by about 0.7 degrees Celsius (red line from 1990 to 2020 in the global temperature dataset below):

Now we want to put this 0.7 degrees Celsius warming over 30 years in context of other large climate changes in earth’s history. Some of the largest and fastest global climate changes in the geological record are associated with the Milankovitch cycles. The most recent Milankovitch cycle transition was that from the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago (when about a mile of ice was on top of Boston) to the Holocene climate starting about 10,000 years ago and this transition was characterized by a global warming of about 5 degrees Celsius.

Thus, this rather dramatic climate change was characterized by a rate of change of 5 degrees Celsius over 10,000 years or 0.005 degrees Celsius per year[9].

Now we can put the global warming of the past 30 years in context. 0.7 degrees Celsius over 30 years is 0.023 degrees Celsius per year. So the warming of the past 30 years has been about 5 times (0.023/0.005 = 4.6) faster than the warming that occurred over the transition from the last glacial maximum to the preindustrial climate.

I have made an animation placing contemporary global warming in the context of previous climate changes:

Below is a static graph of a similar analysis:

Additionally, Dr. Lindzen implicitly supports his claim of “remarkably little” warming with a misleading figure. At the 18-second mark, the video shows a graph of what I believe are satellite-derived monthly temperature anomalies. However, this time period has been cherry-picked to show “remarkably little” warming.

Below is their graph overlain on the full satellite record (which began in 1978). The full satellite record shows that extending their graph in either direction (forward or backward in time) would reveal a clear warming trend.

When these satellite derived temperature products (RSS and UAH in the graph below) are displayed as annual values and plotted on the same axis as the instrumental temperature datasets (Met Office, NASA and NOAA in the graph below), they largely agree with each other. In particular, they all show the same large (in a geological context) rate of warming over the past several decades:

Overall, Dr. Lindzen makes both a verbal claim and a visual claim that the rate of contemporary global warming is small, and both claims are false.","Sara Vicca, Postdoctoral research fellow, University of Antwerp","CO2 is indeed fundamental for most life on Earth. Plants need CO2 to grow and they are at the base of the food chain. However, this fact is often abused to claim that increasing CO2 concentrations is mainly a good thing. Although plant growth is often stimulated by increasing CO2 concentrations, CO2 also causes ocean acidification and warms the planet, thereby generating a cascade of effects from melting of glaciers and sea level rise to altered precipitation patterns and increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves and droughts[5-8]. These in turn threaten water and food supplies, and as climate change progresses, this is also likely to undo much of the beneficial effect that CO2 has on plant growth[8]. I would say this claim is thus misleading in the context of this video.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article in Business Insider accurately describes results from a study estimating up to 3 billion people could live in much warmer temperatures by 2070,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-in-business-insider-accurately-describes-results-from-a-study-estimating-up-to-3-billion-people-could-live-in-much-warmer-temperatures-by-2070/,3 billion people — up to half the current global population — could be living in unbearable heat in 50 years,https://www.businessinsider.com/unlivable-heat-could-impact-more-than-3-billion-by-2070-2020-5,"As many as half of the current world's population could be dealing with ""unlivable heat"" by 2070, a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America showed.

In the next 50 years, somewhere between 1 to 3 billion people are expected to be inflicted with unbearable heat, according to the study. By 2070, that could be about a third of the overall global population at that time.

Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands, an ecologist and co-author of the study, told the Associated Press the projections are ""unlivable for the ordinary, for poor people, for the average world citizen.""

The actual number of people affected will depend on how fast the global population grows and the levels of carbon emissions, the AP reported.

While the worst-case scenario expects over 3 billion people to be impacted, more likely scenarios from the study show that at least 1 billion people will be affected, the AP reported.

""It's a huge amount, and it's a short time. This is why we're worried,"" Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald told the AP.

Mahowald wasn't apart of the study but told the AP that ""the new study makes sense and conveys the urgency of the man-made climate change differently than past research.""

Scheffer told the AP that for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit increase in global average annual temperature ""from man-made climate change,"" about a billion people will end up in areas too warm to live.

Greenhouse gas emissions have to be reduced so average annual temperatures don't rise beyond the approximately 52 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit yearly average that humans have been able to thrive in for the past 6,000 years, USA Today reported.

""We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 years than it has moved (in the past 6,000 years),"" the study said.

The AP reported that the range was found after scientists looked at ""humans like they do bears, birds, and bees to find the 'climate niche' where people and civilizations flourish.""  While humans can live in hotter and colder weather, the further away from that range the harder it is.

The researchers looked at areas most likely to experience the change in range and estimated that around 2 billion people will be living there in the next 50 years.

The study found that large parts of Africa, Asia, South America, and Australia are likely to increase their temperature similar to what 20 million people are already experiencing in places like the Sahara Desert where the annual average temperature is more than 84 degrees Fahrenheit, the AP reported. 

""Large areas of the planet would heat to barely survivable levels and they wouldn't cool down again,"" Scheffer told USA Today. ""Not only would this have devastating direct effects, it leaves societies less able to cope with future crises like new pandemics. The only thing that can stop this happening is a rapid cut in carbon emissions.""",neutral,Accurate,5,"The article in Business Insider discusses findings from a study published May, 2020 that projected one to three billion people could live in much warmer climates by 2070, assuming migration is limited and greenhouse gas emissions remain high[1]. Reports on this study were also published by The Guardian and USA Today, receiving over 39,000 interactions on Facebook across the three articles over the past week. The Business Insider article accurately describes the study’s projected changes in mean annual temperatures around the globe, however, the study does not describe these increased temperatures as “unbearable” or “unlivable,” as claimed in the article. Without adequately discussing the methods and findings of the study, some reviewers state that the article exaggerates the results and misleads readers, as described below.

The study used several human population datasets to map the geographic distribution and density of humans from 6,000 years before present (BP) to today[1]. Human populations are currently concentrated in geographic regions with mean annual temperatures of ~11°C to 15°C, which has remained fairly consistent over time (see figure below).

The authors then mapped increases in mean annual temperatures in 2070, assuming greenhouse gas emissions remained high (using the RCP8.5 scenario[2]), the population grew to 11.1 billion people by 2070 (using the SSP3 scenario[3]), and migration was limited. Under these conditions, 19% of the global land surface and 3.5 billion people, about a third of the population in 2070, will experience mean annual temperatures greater than 29°C. Currently, only 0.8% of the global land surface experiences mean annual temperatures greater than 29°C (see figure below).

The Business Insider article accurately discusses the number of people that could be impacted by increasing mean annual temperatures, but it also states that 3 billion people could experience “unbearable” and “unlivable heat” by 2070. Because the study does not discuss whether humans can or cannot survive the projected changes in mean annual temperatures, these statements exaggerate the study results and can be misleading to readers. The value of 29°C was not chosen based on a critical threshold for human health, but to illustrate the change with a value representing some of the warmest regions people live in today. As described by the reviewers below, the article accurately discusses the key points of the study, but by focusing on the worst-case scenario and exaggerating statements about “unbearable heat” it also misleads readers.",,,,,"Marten Scheffer, Professor, Wageningen University","[Prof. Scheffer was an author of the study that was the topic of this article.]
It is slightly misleading to compare the future amount of people under severe climate stress to the current total population, as in the meantime the global population will have grown. It is not wrong, but it somehow suggests half the people get in severe climate trouble whereas it would be one third (for the high end forcing scenario).","Steven Sherwood, Professor, University of New South Wales","The study does not address temperatures that are “survivable,” only those which humans evidently prefer and thrive in. We know the warmer temperatures are not unsurvivable because people have been surviving in them for millenia. Thus the story is misleading and overhyped.  It appears that the fault for this lies more with overzealous statements by some of the ecologists than the journalist who wrote the story. Nonetheless the warmer temperatures will be more difficult and undoubtedly lead to all kinds of problems, and it is valuable to have this new study highlighting that past societies in these climates have not progressed in the same way as those in cooler climates. So I applaud the study and the choice to write about it, they just needed to stay to what they’d actually shown.","Andrew King, Research fellow, University of Melbourne","Overall, this article provides a fair representation of the study it’s based on. It accurately portrays the study’s main results in the headline, key points and throughout the text. I think the focus of the article on the worst-case scenario ahead of more likely scenarios may not be the most helpful, but this is at least explicit in the article.","Kristie Ebi, Professor, University of Washington","As Xu et al. note[1], the analyses are statistical associations not process-based understanding of the multiple drivers of the location of human settlements over time. The authors note there are many variables they did not investigate because data were not available; this does not mean the variables are unimportant. Some of these variables are likely also to be associated with geographic location of humans, crops, and livestock. It would be interesting to hear from agricultural specialists about variables related to the geographic location of crops (such as growing degree days, day length, timing of precipitation, and others). The perspectives of anthropologists on the drivers of successful human settlements also would be interesting.

The scenario in the main text combines RCP 8.5 and SSP 3, resulting in very high greenhouse gas emissions, leading to greater climate change in 2100 than in other scenarios. The Paris Agreement committed governments to significantly reduce their GHG emissions, decreasing the probability of RCP 8.5.

Article in The Sun misrepresents Antarctic discovery and misplaces it on map,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/article-in-the-sun-misrepresents-antarctic-discovery-and-misplaces-it-on-map-charlotte-edwards/,Melting glaciers reveal LOST island in Antarctica – and humans are already visiting it,https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/11044576/new-island-antarctica-climate-change/,"CLIMATE change in Antarctica may be linked to a never-before-seen island emerging from the ocean, experts have said.

The uncharted island is actually big enough to spot from space but may have gone unnoticed due to previously being hidden beneath a lot of ice, a Nature report suggests.

Rising temperatures in Antarctica over the past decades have been linked to glacial retreat, which is a possible trigger for this island's appearance.

Extreme melting and changes to the climate may have released pressure on to the continent, allowing the ground to rise up, a Nature report claims.

""As glaciers have retreated in West Antarctica, they have released pressure on Earth’s crust, allowing it to rebound and rise,"" said Lindsay Prothro, a glacial geologist at Texas A&M University–Corpus Christi.

Rebounding ground can accelerate the ice cracking and falling away, which may be what happened with this new island that potentially emerged off the coast of Antarctica around 2010.

The island has been named after Sif, the Norse goddess of Earth and wife of Thor.

It was first spotted by members of the Thwaites Offshore Research (THOR) project as their research vessel passed through Pine Island Bay.

This bay is where ice flows into from the Pine Island Glacier, one of the fastest-retreating glaciers in Antarctica.

According to Nature News, experts aren't sure how long the island has been visible but they think climate change may be behind its appearance.

University of Houston marine geologist Julia Wellner was one of the investigators on the expedition that spotted the island.

She tweeted: ""After being the first visitors, we can now confirm that Sif Island is made of granite and that it is covered by remnant ice shelf, and a few seals.""

The expedition crew has taken geological samples of the island, which could help to explain the way the continent is shifting.

We've contacted them to ask more details about the size of the Sif.

Extreme melting events in Antarctica have recently revealed more of existing islands.

Nasa recently released a image of Eagle Island losing 20% of its snow cover in only 9 days at the start of this month.

In other news, rare ice volcanoes have been spotted on Lake Michigan thanks to a recent cold snap.

Antarctica has recorded its hottest temperature on record, with the mercury lurching above 20C for the first time.

And, magical scenes in oceans and rivers have been revealed by the Underwater Photographer of the Year Awards 2020.

Are you concerned about climate change? Let us know in the comments...",low,Overstates scientific confidence,10,"This article in The Sun describes the chance discovery of a small island in Antarctica’s Pine Island Bay, which seems to have appeared in the last decade. But the article sensationally connects this with a recent record high temperature at a station elsewhere in Antarctica. While warming trends in the atmosphere and ocean may be relevant, a single weather record is not.

It is not yet clear what is responsible for the island’s appearance. It could be that upward motion of the bedrock—relieved of weight as the ice sheet shrinks—has raised the island above sea level. It could, instead, be that that island was previously encased in the floating ice shelf in front of the glacier on land.

The map presented in the article is quite inaccurate. The inset box on the map is in the wrong location, and the satellite image is of a different location that is also wrong.

There are two discoveries here that do not belong together. First, record temperatures in the northern Antarctic Peninsula on Seymour Island were measured as a single data point and not associated with large-scale melt events of glacial ice in Antarctica. Second, the uncharted island in Pine Island Bay is 2,000 kilometers away from Seymour Island, with an unknown history but most definitely not revealed by melting due to air temperature in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. This is a prime case of jumping to conclusions before data has confirmed the origin of the island, and making unsound connections between heavily publicized events occurring in Antarctica.","Mike MacFerrin, Postdoctoral Research Associate, University of Colorado in Boulder","The article isn’t wholly inaccurate in itself (aside from the map, which is very bad), but doesn’t really present anything new beyond what has already been published in other outlets.

The inset box is placed over the Antarctic Peninsula, several thousand km from the pin they placed in the Ross Sea, and both of them are more than 1000 km away from the actual location of Pine Island Bay in the Amundsen Sea (see attached image).

Because this island has just been identified and its history is completely unknown, we don’t know if it emerged from below sea level to above sea level by a process called glacial isostatic adjustment, or the floating ice shelf has simply retreated from the island.

ABC article effectively illustrates important climate trends for Australian readers,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/abc-article-effectively-illustrates-important-climate-trends-for-australian-readers-tim-leslie-joshua-byrd-nathan-hoad/,"See how global warming has changed the world since your childhood""
Published in Australian Broadcasting Corporation, by Joshua Byrd, N",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-06/how-climate-change-has-impacted-your-life/11766018,"From top to bottom, these stripes use Bureau of Meteorology data to show how temperatures have changed in Australia since 1910. The colours indicate how much the average temperature of each year is above or below the average temperature from 1961 to 1990.

A blue line means that year was below average; red means it was above average. As you can see there is a pretty clear trend happening — from cool to warm — over the past century. Over this time the world has warmed 0.81 degrees Celsius, and Australia has warmed even more, hitting 1.52 degrees above average last year (2019).

But what about in your lifetime?

This is what’s happened in your life. From 1970 to 2019.

Let’s show it in a slightly different way. The colours mean the same thing, but bars going left show a temperature below average, and bars going right show a temperature above average.

In the year you were born, Australia was 0.1 degrees below average, or put another way 1.62 degrees cooler than Australia’s hottest year on record, which is the one we’ve just experienced, when temperatures hit 1.52 degrees above average.

But what does this even mean? Well let’s expand it out a bit. Think back to when you were six. By this point you’ve seen a few summers, probably run through a few sprinklers, burnt your feet on hot pavement — six-year-old you knows what hot feels like.

Well, not compared to a six-year-old today, you don’t. They’ve lived through four of the five hottest years in Australia; you were 44 years old before you experienced the warming they lived through in the first year of their life.

Now we’re going to show you how this warming has already affected your life, or you can skip ahead and see what is in store for the future if we continue on burning fossil fuels as we always have.

Small increases in average temperature translate to big increases in the number of extremely hot days, and those hot days have a big impact.

High temperatures are part and parcel of living in Australia, but there’s a point where humans struggle to survive.

Many parts of the world, including parts of Australia, already experience this kind of heat. A study looking into deaths around the world from extreme heat found that in 2000, 30.6 per cent of the world’s population were exposed to 20 or more days when temperatures reached this point, which they called the “deadly threshold”.

And when temperatures head towards this threshold it starts to impact the ability of people to lead normal lives. Economic productivity decreases, and the sorts of activities that are a central part of Australian life — like playing sport or heading to the beach — are affected.

As the globe continues to warm, this sort of heat will spread, affecting more and more people for longer and longer periods of time.

And even well below this threshold, extreme heat already has deadly consequences. The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, which claimed the lives of 173 Australians, are etched into the national consciousness.

But in the heatwave that led up to the fires, the number of deaths soared. In Victoria 374 more people died in the week of January 26, compared to the average for that time of year.

That’s not to underestimate the impact of bushfires — that innocuous sounding 1.52 degree rise has seen bushfire risk increase across the continent. When the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action approached the Federal Government in April they were drawing on decades of data showing that fire conditions are getting worse.

So it’s hotter, and there’s a greater risk of bushfires, but has Australia been getting drier? I mean, there were droughts when you were a kid, right? Well Australia hasn’t been getting drier overall, but where the rain is falling is changing and that is already having a big impact.

In the north of the country over summer, we’re actually getting more rain, but in the south where most Australians live — and where the majority of our food is produced — the country is drying out.

And the way the rain falls is changing. Because the atmosphere can hold more water in warmer temperatures, when it does rain we’re getting more high-intensity, extreme rain events — the ones that are associated with flash flooding. Every degree of warming creates a 7 per cent increase in the intensity of those rain events.

So just in your lifetime you can already see a change in how the weather in Australia works. This is the reality of climate change — all the ingredients that are required for natural disasters start to collide with increasing regularity.

What could that look like? Well, those extreme events that used to be irregular occurrences become the normal experience of living in Australia.

And for some Australians that’s already the case. Remember that six-year-old we compared you to before? Their life has been dominated by drought, as temperature records continue to break.

For them, fire season starts at the beginning of spring and rainforests traditionally considered safe go up in flames, rewriting the rule book on how fires must be fought. They live in a world where conditions are so extreme that fire seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres overlap, stretching resources at a time when they’re needed most.

In the aftermath of these disasters, politicians often talk about how you can’t put one event down to climate change. But the catastrophic fires that are burning across the country have brought this link into sharp focus. December 2019 was the hottest on record, 3.21 degrees above average, and 2019 is Australia’s driest year on record.

As the temperature has increased, so has the ability of scientists to determine whether specific events are linked to climate change. They can now model how likely a specific event would be to occur under historical conditions, compared to the record temperatures we’re experiencing.

But it takes time to do these sums. While recently completed modelling shows that the extreme heat that played a role in Queensland’s 2018 fires was made more likely by climate change, we won’t know exactly how much impact it has had on the current fires until that modelling is done for them.

But in November, when he was asked to speak about the current fires Professor Ross Bradstock, the Director of the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong, didn’t mince words.

“We are now in uncharted territory, we’ve gone over the 1 million-hectare mark, and for the forests and woodlands in the eastern half of the state this is unprecedented,” he said.

“It exceeds major fire seasons such as Christmas 2001, January 1994. We are approaching other significant fire seasons such as the alpine fires in 2003 in Victoria, and again in 2006 which were massive blazes.

“The most concerning thing to emphasise is it’s not over, we are not even into summer yet.”

Professor Bradstock says these fires are a warning light that fits with the scenario predicted by climate modellers.

“We’re in a transition from talking over the horizon about climate models telling us about a hypothetical future, to actually experiencing changes that are consistent with some of those projections.”

This all sounds pretty full-on, but what we’re experiencing this summer is just the beginning of how climate change will hurt us.

To see how, let’s look to the future...

What about a child born in Australia today — what will their life look like?

We turned to Monash University to help explore modelling that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses to predict how climate change will impact the world in the future.

The IPCC says that in the next 10 years the world must begin to significantly reduce CO2 emissions. If we continue to use fossil fuels the way we currently do, modelling from the IPCC shows we will be on track for a 4-degree increase in temperatures this century.

That would mean that by the time a child born today is 20, the 2018-19 summer we sweltered through would be considered a mild Australian summer.

By their 30th, the entire Barrier Reef will likely be facing bleaching events every year. This is far more frequent than the five to 10 years it needs to recover from one event.

The start of spring will no longer be a time of anticipation for a summer ahead. Instead it will herald the arrival of conditions like those that led to the latest fires.

And when they turn 50, they’ll probably be celebrating indoors. Remember those “deadly threshold” temperatures, beyond which humans struggle to survive? They’re no longer isolated events. In this scenario, by 2100, 73.9 per cent of the world’s population will be facing at least 20 days a year of deadly heat and humidity.

And before you think that 20 days of this sort of heat is manageable, that’s just a minimum. For vast swathes of the globe, these temperatures will be the norm — and humans will have to learn how to live in an environment too hot for them.

Even Sydney and Melbourne will be facing summers where temperatures top 50 degrees.

But what if the world actually makes the changes needed to considerably cut emissions? The best case scenario IPCC modelling shows that if we cut emissions to limit warming to 1.5 degrees — as set out under the Paris Agreement — the future would be very different.

It would still be hotter and more dangerous than the present. Warming for the next 10 years is already locked in, but after that changes start to make a difference.

When a child born today turns 20, summer will likely be pretty similar to the summer of 2018 — hot and dangerous, but cooler than if we’d done nothing.

In this scenario they may still have the opportunity to visit a living Great Barrier Reef. Keeping the increase in global temperatures at or below 1.5 degrees means it’s more likely a portion of the reef will be able to survive the regular bleaching events, giving it a base to recover from and adapt to higher temperatures.

And by the time they turn 50, if globally we had managed to halt our emissions quickly back in the 2020s, the temperature will have begun to stabilise. We’ll still be facing extreme heat, but at a far more manageable level than if we’d done nothing to halt climate change.

By 2100, 47.6 per cent of the world’s population will be facing more than 20 days per year of deadly temperatures — and far fewer people will be facing a world where those sorts of temperatures are the norm.

To achieve this scenario, things need to change quickly. Global emissions are still rising.

While the Federal Government has committed to a reduction target of 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030, the IPCC says current promises are nowhere near enough to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

At home, Australia emits less than 1.24 per cent of global emissions, but so do most countries. More than 170 countries emit less than Australia each year, and combined, this group of countries emits more than any of the largest emitters — 40 per cent of all emissions come from countries that each emit less than 2 per cent of global emissions. So, even if the major emitters decarbonise, it won’t be enough.

Despite our high per-capita emissions, and our role as a major exporter of fossil fuels, high public support for action on climate change suggests this is possible.

The Australia Talks National Survey found that 79 per cent of us think Australia has a responsibility to take action on climate change, even if the biggest emitting countries don’t follow suit.

And while the issue has divided our federal politicians for a decade, a majority of both Coalition and Labor voters want action.

So the will is there, but time is running out to find our way.

Pollution by plastics, sulphur and nitrogen gases, particulates and chemicals occurs in developing countries. That’s real pollution. The major pollution in advanced economies is the polluting of minds about the role of carbon dioxide. There are no carbon emissions. If there were, we could not see because most carbon is black. Such terms are deliberately misleading, as are many claims.

But then again, we should be used to this after the hysteria about the Great Barrier Reef bleaching that has really been occurring for hundreds of years, fraudulent changing of past weather records, the ignoring of data that shows Pacific islands and the Maldives are growing rather than being inundated, and unsubstantiated claims polar ice is melting. By ignoring history and geology, any claim of unusual weather can be made sensational.

We’ve had reefs on planet Earth for 3500 million years. They came and went many times. The big killer of reefs was because sea level dropped and water temperature decreased. In the past, reefs thrived when water was warmer and there was an elevated carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. Reef material is calcium carbonate, which contains 44 per cent carbon dioxide. Reefs need carbon dioxide; it’s their basic food.

We are not living in a period of catastrophic climate change. The past tells us it’s business as usual.

It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.

Climate models have been around 30 years. They have all failed. Balloon and satellite measurements show a disconnect from climate model predictions. If they have failed across the past 30 years when we can compare models with measurements, there is little chance that the climate projections across the next 50 years will be more successful. Modellers assume carbon dioxide drives climate change. It does not. The role of the sun and clouds was not considered important by modellers. They are the major drivers for the climate on our planet.

We emit a trace atmospheric gas called carbon dioxide at a time in planetary history of low atmospheric carbon dioxide. The geological history of the planet shows major planetary climate changes have never been driven by a trace gas. Just because we are alive today does not mean we change major planetary systems that operated for billions of years. Earth’s climate dances to rhythms every day, every season and on far larger lunar, ocean, solar, orbital, galactic and tectonic cycles. Climate change is normal and continual. When cycles overlap, climate change can be rapid and large. Sporadic events such as supernovas and volcanic eruptions can also change climate.

The main greenhouse gas is water vapour. It is the only gas in air that can evaporate, humidify and condense into clouds that precipitate rain, hail and snow. These processes involve a transfer of energy, and water vapour makes the atmosphere behave like a giant airconditioner. Carbon dioxide is a non-condensable atmospheric gas like nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapour in air varies depending on temperature and location from five times the atmospheric carbon dioxide content in deserts to more than 100 times in the tropics. Water is 12 times more effective than carbon dioxide with respect to all incoming and outgoing radiation.

Earth is unevenly heated. Our spinning oblate globe is influenced by two fluids of different composition and behaviour moving chaotically against each other over the irregular solid surface of the planet. Oceans hold most of the planet’s surface heat, not the atmosphere. Processes that occur during sunlight do not occur at night due to the prime driver of our planet’s surface temperature: the sun.

Carbon dioxide is plant food. It is neither a pollutant nor a toxin. Without carbon dioxide, all life on Earth would die. Plants convert carbon dioxide, water and sunlight during photosynthesis into sugars, cellulose, fruit, vegetables and grains, which animal life uses as food. Marine organisms also take up and use carbon dioxide. Plants need almost three times today’s carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere to thrive. For decades horticulturalists have pumped carbon dioxide into glasshouses to increase yields. The fossil record shows that a thriving and diversification of plant and animal life occurs every time the atmosphere had a very high carbon dioxide content. In the past, warming has never been a threat to life on Earth. Why should it be now? When there is a low atmospheric carbon dioxide content, especially during very cold times, life struggles.

For the past 500 million years, the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has been decreasing and if we halved today’s atmospheric carbon dioxide content, all life would die. This carbon dioxide has been removed into the oceans and is sequestered into coral, shells, limey sediments and muds and on the land into coals, muds, soils and vegetation.

Air contains 0.04 per cent carbon dioxide. We add carbon compounds to our bodies from food and drinks and exhale carbon dioxide. The human breath contains at least 4 per cent carbon dioxide. Our bodies contain carbon compounds. If we were so passionately concerned about our carbon footprint, then the best thing to do is to expire.

In our lifetime, there has been no correlation between carbon dioxide emissions and temperature. On a larger scale, the ice caps show that after a natural orbitally driven warming, atmospheric carbon dioxide content increases 800 years later. Rather than atmos­pheric carbon dioxide driving temperature, it is the opposite. Geology shows us again there is no correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature. Each of the six major past ice ages began when the atmospheric carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present. The thought that a slight increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide will lead to unstoppable global warming is demonstrably wrong.

In the past decade China has increased its carbon dioxide emissions by 53 per cent, 12 times Australia’s total carbon dioxide output of 1.3 per cent of the global total. The grasslands, forests, farms and continental shelves of Australia absorb far more carbon dioxide than we emit. The attack on emissions of the gas of life is an irrational attack on industry, our modern way of life, freedoms and prosperity. It has nothing to do with the environment.",very_low,"Biased, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",4270,"This op-ed in The Australian by Ian Plimer, titled “Let’s not pollute minds with carbon fears”, makes many claims: that polar ice is not melting, that human-caused CO2 emissions can’t cause climate change, that all life on Earth would die if CO2 levels dropped to half of current levels, and so on. None of these things are true.

As was the case with three other op-eds written by Plimer that we evaluated previously, reviewers unanimously rated the scientific credibility of this article “very low”. In their comments below, the scientists identify a large number of inaccurate or incorrect statements about the way Earth’s climate system works, how climate has changed during Earth’s history, and what we know about the impacts of continued climate change.",,,,,"Mark Richardson, Research Associate, Colorado State University/NASA JPL","This article will mislead readers. It uses nonsense logic, is clueless about the science, and says things which are wrong. Some of these false statements have been obviously wrong for years.

One example is claiming “[i]t has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.” This shows cluelessness about decades of important research. Direct measurements1 show that more atmospheric CO2 is causing enough heating to explain the observed warming, and we know that the CO2 rise is caused by us2. Those studies are two of hundreds that have built the overwhelming case that human CO2 emissions are now driving global warming.

Climate models are computer programs that crunch equations describing the laws of physics, and they also calculate that rising CO2 is driving the observed warming. They include changes in solar activity, and a study from 20063 found that climate models calculate strong effects of clouds on global warming—they could either amplify or slow CO2-driven warming. It is completely fake of Plimer’s article to say that “[t]he role of the sun and clouds was not considered important by modellers”.

Since our CO2 emissions are the main driver of recent warming, we expect a correlation between these emissions and global temperature. By plotting temperature against emissions and using standard statistics we can calculate the correlation, this example is for 1959—2014 (the correlation gets stronger if you use other datasets which extend to 2018).

The data show a strong correlation since 1959, with temperatures being higher when cumulative human emissions are higher. It is simple for anyone with basic maths training and an internet connection to check this, and it is false to claim that “in our lifetime, there has been no correlation between carbon dioxide emissions and temperature” as the Australian’s article does.

Correlation doesn’t prove that one causes the other but this is a good example of how the Australian’s article is inaccurate, relies on falsehoods, and will mislead readers.

It is appalling that such a blatantly false article can be published in any credible news outlet today.","Martin Singh, Postdoctoral Research fellow, Harvard University","This article is a mixture of misdirection, misleading claims, and outright falsehoods.

The author attempts to paint a picture of current climate change as simply a continuation of natural changes that have occurred in the past. But this neglects the clear evidence that climate change over the last two centuries has been shown to be largely man-made, that it is much more rapid that anything we have seen in the last two thousand years if not longer, and that it is occurring in the context of a globe with more than 7 billion human inhabitants.

The author makes incorrect claims about climate models failing (against what metric?), that climate change cannot be driven by a trace gas (how did we get out of the ice covered state called “snowball Earth”, not to mention the role of carbon dioxide in many examples of climate change over Earth’s history?), that carbon dioxide concentrations were higher at the beginning of the last ice age (they weren’t).

Interspersed with these falsehoods are various long interludes about how carbon dioxide is essential for life and helps plants grow. This doesn’t change the fact that the planet is getting warmer, and it doesn’t change the fact that most studies expect agricultural yields to suffer as the world becomes increasingly warmer in spite of the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect.

The facts are that human activity has increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to levels not seen for close to a million years. Multiple lines of evidence from observations, modelling, and theory shows us that this increase in greenhouse gas concentrations leads to warming of the globe. As this warming continues, it will lead to sea-level rise, changes to rainfall patterns, and, for higher levels of warming, it may render parts of the world essentially uninhabitable for humans without air conditioning.

This results in more frequent and more intense heatwaves and therefore mass bleaching. Much slower warming as in the geological record give ecosystems a chance to adapt.

Reefs need carbon dioxide; it’s their basic food.","This is not correct. CO2 dissolves in seawater, forming carbonic acid, bicarbonate ion, and carbonate ion. During these reactions, free hydrogen ions are released, which lower the seawater pH and result in ocean acidification. Corals form from calcium carbonate, however, due to the increase of dissolved CO2 in seawater and the resulting increase in hydrogen ion, the dominance of dissolved CO2 species shifts from carbonate ion to bicarbonate ion to maintain chemical equilibrium. This is nicely illustrated in the Bjerrum plot.

Clouds are considered extremely important by all climate modellers. (See, for example, here.)

Variations in solar irradiance have caused only a very small change to the planet’s overall energy balance over the last century or so. On the other hand, greenhouse gas emissions have caused a much larger change to the planetary energy balance, and this has led to global warming.

Clouds provide an important feedback to climate change, but they cannot reasonably be described as a “driver” of climate change. There must be some other factor that causes the clouds to change. (E.g. changes in the surface temperature owing to greenhouse-gas emissions).

New York Times op-ed claiming scientists underestimated climate change lacks supporting evidence,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-op-ed-claiming-scientists-underestimated-climate-change-lacks-supporting-evidence-eugene-linden/,How Scientists Got Climate Change So Wrong,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/opinion/sunday/science-climate-change.html,"For decades, most scientists saw climate change as a distant prospect. We now know that thinking was wrong. This summer, for instance, a heat wave in Europe penetrated the Arctic, pushing temperatures into the 80s across much of the Far North and, according to the Belgian climate scientist Xavier Fettweis, melting some 40 billion tons of Greenland’s ice sheet.

Had a scientist in the early 1990s suggested that within 25 years a single heat wave would measurably raise sea levels, at an estimated two one-hundredths of an inch, bake the Arctic and produce Sahara-like temperatures in Paris and Berlin, the prediction would have been dismissed as alarmist. But many worst-case scenarios from that time are now realities.

Science is a process of discovery. It can move slowly as the pieces of a puzzle fall together and scientists refine their investigative tools. But in the case of climate, this deliberation has been accompanied by inertia born of bureaucratic caution and politics. A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold” and said one of the reasons was “the perceived need for consensus.” This has had severe consequences, diluting what should have been a sense of urgency and vastly understating the looming costs of adaptation and dislocation as the planet continues to warm.

In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations group of thousands of scientists representing 195 countries, said in its first report that climate change would arrive at a stately pace, that the methane-laden Arctic permafrost was not in danger of thawing, and that the Antarctic ice sheets were stable.

Relying on the climate change panel’s assessment, economists estimated that the economic hit would be small, providing further ammunition against an aggressive approach to reducing emissions and to building resilience to climate change.

As we now know, all of those predictions turned out to be completely wrong. Which makes you wonder whether the projected risks of further warming, dire as they are, might still be understated. How bad will things get?

So far, the costs of underestimation have been enormous. New York City’s subway system did not flood in its first 108 years, but Hurricane Sandy’s 2012 storm surge caused nearly $5 billion in water damage, much of which is still not repaired. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey gave Houston and the surrounding region a $125 billion lesson about the costs of misjudging the potential for floods.

The climate change panel seems finally to have caught up with the gravity of the climate crisis. Last year, the organization detailed the extraordinary difficulty of limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius), over the next 80 years, and the grim consequences that will result even if that goal is met.

More likely, a separate United Nations report concluded, we are headed for warming of at least 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. That will come with almost unimaginable damage to economies and ecosystems. Unfortunately, this dose of reality arrives more than 30 years after human-caused climate change became a mainstream issue.

The word “upended” does not do justice to the revolution in climate science wrought by the discovery of sudden climate change. The realization that the global climate can swing between warm and cold periods in a matter of decades or even less came as a profound shock to scientists who thought those shifts took hundreds if not thousands of years.

Scientists knew major volcanic eruptions or asteroid strikes could affect climate rapidly, but such occurrences were uncommon and unpredictable. Absent such rare events, changes in climate looked steady and smooth, a consequence of slow-moving geophysical factors like the earth’s orbital cycle in combination with the tilt of the planet’s axis, or shifts in the continental plates.

Then, in the 1960s, a few scientists began to focus on an unusual event that took place after the last ice age. Scattered evidence suggested that the post-ice age warming was interrupted by a sudden cooling that began around 12,000 years ago and ended abruptly 1,300 years later. The era was named the Younger Dryas for a plant that proliferated during that cold period.

At first, some scientists questioned the rapidity and global reach of the cooling. A report from the National Academies of Science in 1975 acknowledged the Younger Dryas but concluded that it would take centuries for the climate to change in a meaningful way. But not everyone agreed. The climate scientist Wallace Broecker at Columbia had offered a theory that changes in ocean circulation could bring about sudden climate shifts like the Younger Dryas.

And it was Dr. Broecker who, in 1975, the same year as that National Academies report playing down the Younger Dryas, published a paper, titled “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?” in which he predicted that emissions of carbon dioxide would raise global temperatures significantly in the 21st century. This is now seen as prophetic, but at the time, Dr. Broecker was an outlier.

Then, in the early 1990s, scientists completed more precise studies of ice cores extracted from the Greenland ice sheet. Dust and oxygen isotopes encased in the cores provided a detailed climate record going back eons. It revealed that there had been 25 rapid climate change events like the Younger Dryas in the last glacial period.

The evidence in those ice cores would prove pivotal in turning the conventional wisdom. As the science historian Spencer Weart put it: “How abrupt was the discovery of abrupt climate change? Many climate experts would put their finger on one moment: the day they read the 1993 report of the analysis of Greenland ice cores. Before that, almost nobody confidently believed that the climate could change massively within a decade or two; after the report, almost nobody felt sure that it could not.”

In 2002, the National Academies acknowledged the reality of rapid climate change in a report, “Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises,” which described the new consensus as a “paradigm shift.” This was a reversal of its 1975 report.

“Large, abrupt climate changes have affected hemispheric to global regions repeatedly, as shown by numerous paleoclimate records,” the report said, and added that “changes of up to 16 degrees Celsius and a factor of 2 in precipitation have occurred in some places in periods as short as decades to years.”

The National Academies report added that the implications of such potential rapid changes had not yet been considered by policymakers and economists. And even today, 17 years later, a substantial portion of the American public remains unaware or unconvinced it is happening.

Were the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica to melt, sea levels would rise by an estimated 225 feet worldwide. Few expect that to happen anytime soon. But those ice sheets now look a lot more fragile than they did to the climate change panel in 1995, when it said that little change was expected over the next hundred years.

In the years since, data has shown that both Greenland and Antarctica have been shedding ice far more rapidly than anticipated. Ice shelves, which are floating extensions of land ice, hold back glaciers from sliding into the sea and eventually melting. In the early 2000s, ice shelves began disintegrating in several parts of Antarctica, and scientists realized that process could greatly accelerate the demise of the vastly larger ice sheets themselves. And some major glaciers are dumping ice directly into the ocean.

By 2014, a number of scientists had concluded that an irreversible collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet had already begun, and computer modeling in 2016 indicated that its disintegration in concert with other melting could raise sea levels up to six feet by 2100, about twice the increase described as a possible worst-case scenario just three years earlier. At that pace, some of the world’s great coastal cities, including New York, London and Hong Kong, would become inundated.

Then this year, a review of 40 years of satellite images suggested that the East Antarctic ice sheet, which was thought to be relatively stable, may also be shedding vast amounts of ice.

As the seas rise, they are also warming at a pace unanticipated as recently as five years ago. This is very bad news. For one thing, a warmer ocean means more powerful storms, and die-offs of marine life, but it also suggests that the planet is more sensitive to increased carbon dioxide emissions than previously thought.

The melting of permafrost has also defied expectations. This is ground that has remained frozen for at least two consecutive years and covers around a quarter of the exposed land mass of the Northern Hemisphere. As recently as 1995, it was thought to be stable. But by 2005, the National Center for Atmospheric Research estimated that up to 90 percent of the Northern Hemisphere’s topmost layer of permafrost could thaw by 2100, releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.

For all of the missed predictions, changes in the weather are confirming earlier expectations that a warming globe would be accompanied by an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather. And there are new findings unforeseen by early studies, such as the extremely rapid intensification of storms, as on Sept. 1, when Hurricane Dorian’s sustained winds intensified from 150 to 185 miles per hour in just nine hours, and last year when Hurricane Michael grew from tropical depression to major hurricane in just two days.

If the Trump administration has its way, even the revised worst-case scenarios may turn out to be too rosy. In late August, the administration announced a plan to roll back regulations intended to limit methane emissions resulting from oil and gas exploration, despite opposition from some of the largest companies subject to those regulations. More recently, its actions approached the surreal as the Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation into those auto companies that have agreed in principle to abide by higher gas mileage standards required by California. The administration also formally revoked a waiver allowing California to set stricter limits on tailpipe emissions than the federal government.

Even if scientists end up having lowballed their latest assessments of the consequences of the greenhouse gases we continue to emit into the atmosphere, their predictions are dire enough. But the Trump administration has made its posture toward climate change abundantly clear: Bring it on!

It’s already here. And it is going to get worse. A lot worse.",low,"Clickbait headline, Misleading",430,"This op-ed by author Eugene Linden, published under the headline “How Scientists Got Climate Change So Wrong”, argues that climate scientists have long underestimated climate change. The article discusses the state of science as far back as the 1950s but focuses on the period since the 1990s, claiming that we are now seeing climate impacts previously thought to be far in the future.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that some of the evidence used to support this argument is based on a misrepresentation of the state of scientific knowledge at points in the past. Although the article discusses some topics accurately, such as noting advances in the understanding of ice sheets over the years, it fails to acknowledge many long-accurate predictions that show how useful climate projections have been in warning of the impacts of climate change.

In the annotations below, scientists highlight specific reports and studies that don’t match the descriptions given in the article. For example, the article states that the First Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published in 1990, concluded that “climate change would arrive at a stately pace”. But if anything, that report projected slightly more rapid warming than what the Earth has experienced so far—partly because humans have emitted a little less greenhouse gas than the scenario used in the report to project warming.","The main flaw in the author’s argument that scientists have “underestimated” the rate and severity of climate change is that the author predominantly points to recent extreme events as evidence of what scientists “failed to predict” (such as the heat wave that extended into the Arctic and drove rapid melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet or recent hurricanes). The author implies that scientists did not give the public fair warning about the potential of such events. Firstly, scientists cannot predict the particular extreme events that will unfold decades in the future. What they can and did do (quite accurately in the IPCC assessments) is to provide estimates for long-term projections based on the best available data and models. Against this long-term backdrop of global change will inevitably be the local and regional-scale extreme events and tipping points that are inherently difficult to predict. The author cites one such consensus report from nearly 2 decades ago: “Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises”, which in the very title conveys this basic message—climate change will manifest in abrupt and surprising ways.

Abrupt climate change by its very nature is difficult to predict. Despite this inherent difficulty, there has been scientific research and progress in trying to assess the likelihood of certain tipping points1. And to try and anticipate early warning signs prior to critical transitions. For example, this study2 and a more recent report from 2013: “Abrupt Climate Change: Anticipating Surprises”3.

Secondly, while I do agree that awareness of abrupt climate change and the ways in which long-term changes will increase the severity and probability of extreme events is generally lacking among the wider public, to somehow blame this on the scientists who have been working to understand and disseminate this knowledge for decades is a complete mislocation of blame. The author completely neglects the wider social and political context through which perception of scientific understanding and climate action/adaption has occurred.

None of this is to say that scientists knew everything and got it all right decades ago. Of course they didn’t. To quote the author, “Science is a process of discovery. It can move slowly as the pieces of a puzzle fall together and scientists refine their investigative tools.” So, yes, scientists are still actively working to understand more about the dynamics of abrupt climate and potential ways to anticipate inherently “unpredictable” phenomena, all while trying to keep up with the pace of climate change.

I found numerous factual errors and mis-interpretations in this presentation. The reality is, since at least the 80s, climate scientists have been making broadly consistent projections (to whomever was listening). The observed pace of warming is on par with these projections—not faster. What’s true is that some impacts of that warming are happening faster than initially anticipated. That includes the melting of polar sea ice and ice caps. The author here focuses a lot on these aspects, but these are just one aspect of climate change, amongst many others—for which changes are unfolding essentially as expected. So, overall, to me this article presents an incomplete and biased view of climate change. I found the title, in particular, very problematic (it may not have been written by the author, though, but instead by the paper).","Amber Kerr, Researcher, Agricultural Sustainability Institute, University of California, Davis","Most of the specific facts and statistics in this op-ed are correct, but the overall effect is significantly misleading. The author’s central point is that scientists have been drastically underestimating the scope and the pace of climate change until just the past decade or so, and recent events such as permafrost melting, ice cap loss, and extreme weather events have caught them by surprise. This is simply not true.

Predictions on the overall pace of global warming, and on its specific effects, have been quite consistent (and broadly accurate) since at least 1990, and in some cases since the late 1970s. For example, the cover story of TIME Magazine on October 19, 1987 was titled “The Heat is On.”1 This article warned the American public that “man-made contributions to the greenhouse effect, mainly CO2 that is generated by the burning of fossil fuels, may be hastening a global warming trend that could raise average temperatures between 2 degrees F and 8 degrees F by the year 2050.” That is, if anything, somewhat higher than current predictions.

Similar critiques can be made of Mr. Linden’s claim that economists were universally unconcerned about the costs of climate change. Even in the late 1990s and early 2000s, that was not true. He cites William Nordhaus to make his point, but he doesn’t cite any other economic damage estimates, such as those made by Richard Tol in 20021 or, even more on the pessimistic end, Nicholas Stern in 20062.

I especially object to the article’s title: “How Scientists Got Climate Change So Wrong.” It implies that inaction on climate change can largely be blamed on unimaginative scientists conforming to a status quo belief that climate is nearly immovable and human perturbations are insignificant. According to Linden, scientists didn’t think “abrupt climate change” was possible until the publication of some Greenland ice core data in the mid-1990s and a paleoclimate summary report in the early 2000s. That is not really true. Scientists were sounding the alarm about rapid anthropogenic climate change as early as the late 1970s. (I studied with climatologist Stephen Schneider at Stanford in the late 1990s, and he was just as concerned about climate change then as he was a decade later.) This ongoing calamity, in which climate scientists presented well-grounded and deeply worrying predictions to policymakers only to be ignored, was described very well in another NY Times article, “Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change“.

Mr. Linden’s goal with this op-ed may have been to drum up increasing public concern for climate change. If so, that is a worthy goal, but I believe he is going about it in the wrong way—by criticizing climate scientists for their supposed timidity and failed predictions, when in fact climate scientists have presented a remarkably consistent series of predictions for at least the past three decades (even if those predictions have fallen on deaf ears).

The presented science is largely accurate and supports current peer-reviewed scientific literature on the topic. In a few cases, clarification or disclaimers are needed to reflect uncertainty in the current state of ice sheets and their contributions to sea level as some statements in the article portray definitive certainty when that is not entirely the case.","Peter Neff, Assistant Research Professor, University of Minnesota","To blame the very scientists who identified global warming and continue to monitor its impacts across the world, while ignoring the active efforts in support of disinformation is grossly irresponsible. The author cites many facts, for instance about Antarctic glaciology, but omits important details that expand the timeline of research and warnings back 40 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"How Scientists Got Climate Change So Wrong
Few thought it would arrive so quickly. Now we’re facing consequences once viewed as fringe scenarios.","This is not factually correct. Global warming projections have been essentially the same since at least the Charney report in 19791, and even before that (in the sense that the central estimate of climate sensitivity to CO2 is still the same). Overall warming has proceeded in the real world essentially as projected—not slower, not faster. Many predicted aspects of climate change, such the spatial and temporal pattern of that warming (e.g. more warming over land and at higher latitudes), changes in the water cycle, in extremes events, etc.. are also borne out in observations, at least qualitatively.

What’s true is that some impacts of the warming on polar ice, such as decrease in Arctic sea ice, melting of the ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica, are happening faster than predicted early on—but that’s essentially because knowledge of these systems was very limited at the time (and thus predictions were very cautious).

Overall it seems to me, if one tries to be objective, that scientists got climate change right for the most part—so far.

1- National Research Council (1979) Carbon Dioxide and Climate: A Scientific Assessment","I agree with Alexis Berg regarding the overall premise of this piece. Overall, climate scientists’ predictions have, on average, been roughly correct for quite a few decades now. This opinion piece by Eugene Linden seems to selectively present historical predictions that turned out to be underestimates, while ignoring those that were right-on or even overestimates. For example, in 1979, James Hansen and others made an educated guess that global temperatures would increase by about 3°C in 2035. That (fortunately) looks like it will turn out to be a significant overestimate.",,,"For decades, most scientists saw climate change as a distant prospect. We now know that thinking was wrong.","I am not sure what “decades” this is about. Perhaps in the 60s and 70s. But ever since modeling studies and projections began in earnest, e.g. in the 80s and 90s, projections have indicated significant warming by, for example, 2100.","More than two decades ago (in 1997), Eugene Linden wrote: “Scientists have assumed that any change caused by humans would occur over many decades. They are no longer so sure.” There is some wiggle room, but these two claims mostly do not match.",,,"Had a scientist in the early 1990s suggested that within 25 years a single heat wave would measurably raise sea levels, at an estimated two one-hundredths of an inch, bake the Arctic and produce Sahara-like temperatures in Paris and Berlin, the prediction would have been dismissed as alarmist.","Actually, climate models from the first IPCC report in 1990 were projecting more warming than subsequent reports (I believe because they didn’t account for aerosols at the time, which cool the climate, overestimated future CO2 emissions, and didn’t account for ocean dynamics).","The IPCC absolutely was predicting significant and relatively rapid warming in its first report in 1990. Their best estimate was 0.3°C per decade throughout the 21st century (thus, 3.3°C by 2100) under “business as usual emissions,” which of course are higher now than they were then. This is comparable with current estimates.

Furthermore, the danger was being reported in the popular press even earlier than 1990. For example, on October 19, 1987, TIME Magazine ran a cover story titled “The Heat is On.” A key quote from that article, paraphrasing climatologist Stephen Schneider, states that “man-made contributions to the greenhouse effect, mainly CO2 that is generated by the burning of fossil fuels, may be hastening a global warming trend that could raise average temperatures between 2 degrees F and 8 degrees F by the year 2050.” That is not exactly a “stately pace.”","Which would have been fair if our understanding of the climate system was not yet sufficient 25 years ago to predict whether heat waves would become worse and by how much. That is not a trivial question, local heat waves are not just determined by the global annual mean temperature.",,"But in the case of climate, this deliberation has been accompanied by inertia born of bureaucratic caution and politics.",No evidence provided.,,,,A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold” and said one of the reasons was “the perceived need for consensus.”,"The current IPCC projections are not intentionally underestimated. We are still at a stage of discovering new processes that are important to the ice-ocean-climate system. Therefore, taking a step forward of being able to incorporate important processes in models, to varying degrees, limits the uncertainty and magnitude of future changes. For example, recent numerical model work by Robel et al1 has demonstrated the importance of a single ice-destabilizing process in sea-level projections that can increase the magnitude and uncertainty in sea-level scenarios. This is just one example of how a single process or condition impacts the (un)certainty in future sea levels and thus limits community planning that takes into account a large range of scenarios, in particular the high-end scenarios that will be more costly for mitigation infrastructure.

Quoting the summary for policy makers from that first report in 1990: “Based on current models, we predict: under business-as-usual, increase of global mean temperature during the [21st] century of about 0.3 °C per decade (with an uncertainty range of 0.2 to 0.5 °C per decade); this is greater than that seen over the past 10,000 years; under other … scenarios which assume progressively increasing levels of controls, rates of increase in global mean temperature of about 0.2 °C [to] about 0.1 °C per decade.”

Like I mentioned above, these early models were actually running even hotter than current models.",,,,[The 1990 IPCC report said] that the Antarctic ice sheets were stable,"Although this was the conception, the idea that the Antarctic ice sheet was stable in the 1990s largely stems from a lack of continental scale observations provided by remote sensing and a lack of widespread in situ, on-ice observations. Therefore, late 20th century thought about a stable Antarctic ice sheet stemmed from negative evidence, rather than positive evidence supported by observations.","Again, technically, not true. The report summary indicates that: “The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is of special concern. A large portion of it containing an amount of ice equivalent to about 5m of global sea level, is grounded far below sea level. There have been suggestions that a sudden outflow of ice might result from global warming and raise sea level quickly and substantially”.

The report concludes that: “Within the next century it is not likely that there will be a major outflow of ice from West Antarctica due directly to global warming”—but not that it is “stable”.

That report also emphasized uncertainties in that respect a whole lot.","As Lauren also highlights, the IPCC has struggled to represent the possibility of more rapid collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet, particularly West Antarctica. Antarctica was viewed as more stable before the continent-scale satellite observations beginning in the 1990s and improved glaciological observations. However, Mercer gave a strong, clear warning in the journal Nature in 19781, with the article “West Antarctic ice sheet and CO2 greenhouse effect: a threat of disaster.” His predictions remain a central paradigm in Antarctic glaciology and scientists from the US and UK are currently rushing to the most vulnerable glacier in Antarctica—Thwaites Glacier—to further clarify how much sea level rise may come from this location, and importantly, how fast. The amount of ice at play here is on the order of 10 feet of global mean sea level equivalent.

Nordhaus, have more to do with his methodology (the DICE model and its damage function) than with climate projections themselves. Like I said, models at that time indicated even faster warming.","Not all economists. For example, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, widely cited economist Richard Tol published analyses indicating that doubled CO2 would probably cost at least 0.6% of global GDP by 2100, and quite possibly as much as 1.2% of GDP if climate sensitivity was worse than expected or adaptation was less successful than anticipated1.

The UN is simply restating that this is where we are currently headed.",Alexis Berg is right again. This value (5.4°F or 3.4°C of warming) is in line with what has consistently been predicted for the past 30 years.,,,"Conventional wisdom, in the 1950s, on the pace of major climate change: 8,000 years Each large square = 100 years 1960s through the ’80s: Centuries or millenniums 1990s to today: 5 to 50 years","While this graphic may apply to natural climate variations, I would argue that it doesn’t really apply to current, man-made climate change, in the sense that since at least the 70s scientists understood that climate would respond to human CO2 emissions within decades (i.e., not millennia as implied by that graph).","It is not true that climate scientists in the 1970s and 1980s thought that any significant climate changes would take centuries or millennia. On the contrary, 30-40 years ago, the predictions on the extent and pace of climate change were very similar to today’s predictions. This was reviewed exhaustively in another recent NY Times article, “Losing Earth“. Here are a couple representative quotes:

“[A 1978 EPA report warned that] fossil fuels might, within two or three decades, bring about “significant and damaging” changes to the global atmosphere.”

“[In 1979, a team of scientists calculated that] when carbon dioxide doubled in 2035 or thereabouts, global temperatures would increase between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius, with the most likely outcome a warming of three degrees.”",,,"The evidence in those ice cores would prove pivotal in turning the conventional wisdom. As the science historian Spencer Weart put it: “How abrupt was the discovery of abrupt climate change? Many climate experts would put their finger on one moment: the day they read the 1993 report of the analysis of Greenland ice cores. Before that, almost nobody confidently believed that the climate could change massively within a decade or two; after the report, almost nobody felt sure that it could not.”","This whole section of the article somehow implies that when scientists found out about abrupt climate change events during the last glacial era (i.e., the Younger Dryas event, and Dansgaard–Oeschger events) is when they fully realized climate could change by 2100 rapidly in response to CO2. I don’t believe this perspective is correct. Abrupt climate swings in the last glacial era are not really relevant to our current, interglacial climate (in which they don’t happen), and the projected climate response to CO2 emissions does not involve such processes.",,,,"In 2002, the National Academies acknowledged the reality of rapid climate change in a report, “Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises”","I do not think it is well justified to tie the publication of this 2002 paleoclimate report to a sudden supposed epiphany in the scientific community about how modern emissions of greenhouse gases would affect global temperature. As Alexis Berg and I have said repeatedly above, climate scientists’ warming predictions have generally been right on track, and have not changed much for the past 30-40 years.

(In fact, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius described the basic cause and effect of fossil-fuel-induced climate change back in the 1890s. That is not a typo—Arrhenius made a roughly correct quantitative calculation 130 years ago.)",The title of the report alone shows that science did warn that taking the climate system into uncharted territories is dangerous. Specific warnings can only be given once a problem is understood.,,,"And even today, 17 years later, a substantial portion of the American public remains unaware or unconvinced it is happening.","Science is a global enterprise as knowledge is universal.

That the denial of the reality is an Anglo-American phenomenon suggests that the main problem is not science, but American political problems and the US-Australian media.

This is the science,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/10/15/climate-change-fake-news-global-threat-science/,"The impact of humans on Earth is unparalleled, with scientists arguing our actions have tipped the planet into a new era - the Anthropocene - with fallout from nuclear bombs now written into the rocks beneath our feet, and species facing extinction at 1,000 times the usual rate.

Yet global warming could turn out to be the most devastating consequence of human progress. If temperatures continue to increase, experts forecast catastrophic sea level rises, a surge in hurricanes and cyclones, the spread of lethal disease, drought, famine and deadly heatwaves. 

But does the science back up these claims? Is carbon dioxide primarily to blame or could there be other causes? What role do the Sun, clouds and the oceans play? 

And, can today’s climate models be trusted when scientists have misrepresented the data in the past?

Here is what we know:

Global temperature rise 

Earth’s climate has changed continually throughout its 4.5 billion year history, cycling through periods of cooling and warming, of glacial advance and retreat.

The last ice age ended around 11,700 years ago, ushering in a new temperate interglacial period - known as the Holocene - and triggering the birth of agriculture and the rise of civilisation. 

Reliable surface temperature records have been available since around the 1850s, and it is now accepted that Earth is, indeed, warming. 

The planet's average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F (0.9C) during that period, with most of the warming occurring in the past 35 years. Since 1990, global temperatures have risen between 0.23F (0.13C) and 0.34F (0.19C) per decade, depending on which official data set is used.

Globally, the five warmest years on record have all occurred since 2010 and, in Britain, the hottest 10 years since Met Office records began in 1884 have all happened since 2002. None of the 10 coldest years have occurred since 1963.


However the warming trend is slower than most climate models have forecast.

In 1990 the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that temperatures would rise by 0.54F (0.3C) per decade. Skeptics argue that the forecasts were too high because they relied too heavily on the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2).

CO2 has indeed increased in the atmosphere, from approximately 0.03 per cent to 0.04 per cent (or 400 parts per million, ppm) over the past 50 years. And isotope measurements have shown that this rise is due to the burning of fossil fuels.


Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, absorbing and emitting certain frequencies of infrared radiation so it is generally accepted that man-made emissions must be having some kind of impact on global warming.

Yet, some scientists argue that the gas is not capable of producing the extreme temperature rises seen in recent decades.

In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010.

But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.

The greenhouse effect

At its heart, climate change is about electromagnetic radiation coming from the Sun. To warm up, the Earth must be trapping more energy than it is leaking back into space.

In the 1820s, the French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier realised that the ‘greenhouse effect’ must exist, otherwise our planet would be mainly frozen. 

As early as 1856, Eunice Foote theorised that changing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would alter the planet’s temperature. In a paper titled ‘Circumstances affecting the heat of the Sun’s rays’, she outlined the thermal blanket effect of CO2.

Just five years later, John Tyndall, the Irish physicist, directly measured the warming effect of CO2, water vapour and other gases and in 1896, the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius calculated that the Earth’s temperature would rise by several degrees if all the known coal in the world was burned. 

By 1938, the English steam engineer and inventor Guy Callendar suggested that rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere had already caused the Earth to warm and in the 1960s US  scholar Roger Revelle compiled the first series of measurements showing that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were rising. 

Even ExxonMobil’s own scientists predicted in 1982 that the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and warming we would see by now if we the world did not curtail fossil fuel burning. 

The gases in our atmosphere keep Earth nearly 60F (30C) warmer than it would be without an atmosphere. Based on our proximity to the Sun, the planet's surface should be at -0.4F (-18C) but instead its a balmy 59F (15C). 

Dr Ed Hawkins, Professor of Climate Science, at the University of Reading, said: “Greenhouse gases act as a blanket by making it harder for the heat to leave. The more blankets you add the warmer you get.”

However, some experts argue that carbon dioxide is only a minor player in this atmospheric hothouse effect. Ice cores from Antarctica show that at the end of recent ice ages, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise only after temperatures began to climb.

Added to that, CO2 is only one of several greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. There is also methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride.  But by far the largest greenhouse gas is water vapour, which makes 95 per cent of the total.

Scientists such as Dr Willie Soon, a solar astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, have shown that as water vapour rises, so does temperature. It is why cloudless nights are so chilly. 

“These guys say if you change the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere we’re going to change the whole system,” he told a meeting in the US in August. 

“It’s a bit ridiculous actually. Correlation does not equal causation. CO2 is not powerful in that sense, the only thing it does in the system is make the planet greener. Carbon Dioxide is playing a minor role in the total greenhouse effect.”

Yet other scientists claim this is a red herring because of the positive feedback loop created by water vapour.

As temperatures increase, more water evaporates, and thus more water vapour is created. So if something, such as CO2 causes even a small temperature increase, more water vapour will be created, and the temperature will rise further.

Studies show that water vapour feedback doubles the amount of warming caused by CO2. Carbon dioxide also stays in the atmosphere for longer, while water vapour is short lived.

Dr Piers Forster, Professor of Physical Climate Change and Director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds, said: “Bizarrely it is the most fundamental physics that some climate sceptics have chosen to go after, saying that CO2 doesn’t absorb radiation or that the effect is masked by water vapour.

“This is a strange front to attack, as since Tyndall the absorption of CO2 has been measured not be climate scientists but by physicists and chemists in labs all over the world in precise detail. Measurements from space and on the Earth’s surface confirm that CO2 is absorbing more and more radiation.

“After 30 years of research into it I treat (man-made climate change) with as much certainty as gravity - maybe even more certainty than gravity, in fact, as I’ve tested man-made climate change many times with my own investigations and calculations, but only ever tested gravity by dropping heavy objects on my toe.”

Some of Dr Soon’s work is paid for by oil companies who clearly have a vested interest in making the blame for global warming fall elsewhere.

On the other hand academics claim it’s virtually impossible to get funded for work that disputes climate change through other channels. Even the BBC has admitted to Ofcom that the corporation is now biased on the matter because it no longer thinks there is a counter-argument.

Yet Dr Hawkins said the evidence was now irrefutable. “Human-caused climate change is not something that one can choose to ‘believe’ or not. 

“The overwhelming scientific evidence leads to the conclusion that humans are the dominant cause of the recent warming – a person’s ‘beliefs’ cannot affect this. 

“For me, one of the key pieces of evidence is the basic physics which underpins the greenhouse effect, which has been understood for over 150 years.”

The Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age

While dependable temperature records exist from the mid-19th century, if scientists want to study the climate before then, they must rely on proxy data from sources such as tree rings, ice cores and boreholes. And this is where much of the dispute surrounding climate change lies.

One of the main areas of contention is the existence of two strange climate episodes known as The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age. 

The MWP lasted from about 950 to 1250AD, and temperature records appear to show it was even hotter than today, allowing grain crops to flourish, the global population to soar and wine grapes to be planted in England for the first time in hundreds of years.

But the period has caused a headache for climate scientists because clearly there was no upswell in carbon dioxide that could account for such swift warming. 

Likewise temperatures suddenly plummeted after the MWP, bringing a period of cooling known as the Little Ice Age (1300 - 1850AD), when pack ice in the North Atlantic and glaciers in Greenland began advancing southwards, and frost fairs were held on the Thames when the river froze.

Skeptics claim such anomalies prove that Earth can quickly warm and cool even in the absence of carbon dioxide, and any warming today may be caused by similar natural events. 

The MWP was such a fly in the ointment in the case for man-made global warming that in 1995 one scientist at the IPCC - Jonathan Overpeck - wrote an email to a colleague claiming ‘we have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.’

Four years later a paper appeared in the journal Nature showing the famous ‘Hockey stick’ graph of temperature data for 1,000 years, in which both the MWP and the Little Ice Age had been smoothed away. It also included a noticeable ‘tick’ at the end which indicated a staggering level of warming at the end of the 20th century.

The ‘Hockey stick’ graph was used for years by the IPCC and environmentalists including former Vice President Al Gore as proof of man-made climate change, yet it later emerged that its creator Dr Michael Mann had spliced two datasets together - tree-rings showing temperatures going back hundreds of years, then recent thermometer readings for the more recent decades. 

Experts argued that tree-ring data is a hopelessly flawed measure of climate as yearly growth is not just based on temperature but also rainfall, pests, and nutrients in soil. Canadian geologist, Stephen McIntyre discovered much of the data had been based American bristlecone pines – which showed a spurt in growth in the twentieth century that was not linked to climate change. The IPCC no longer includes the ‘Hockey stick’ chart in its reports. 

More recently, studies have suggested the MWP and Little Ice Age may be localised rather than global events which is why they are absent from Dr Mann’s tree-ring datasets. It is possible they were caused by nearby volcanic activity or changes in ocean currents. 

Dr Forster added: “Any historic warm periods over the last 2,000 years were only ever a local phenomenon.

“I’ve spent most of my career trying to look for things other than greenhouse gases that have caused temperatures to rise, calculating the effects of volcanoes, solar changes, aviation contrails, soot emissions, water vapour in the upper atmosphere to see how they compare with greenhouse gases.

“This gives me my certainty that mankind, principally through CO2 emissions has caused the warming we observe. Nothing else I’ve researched has come close to matching its effect.”

Yet a study published just this week, by the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway, found that the natural climate system can change abruptly, without the need for any external forces.

The Norwegian team believes spontaneous cooling may have caused Arctic glaciers to grow from around 700AD even though there was little change in solar radiation or volcanic eruptions to trigger falling temperatures. 

“For some time now, climate models have simulated abrupt changes that develop spontaneously"", said physicist Dr Andreas Born.

""But often, these experiments are seen as the ugly ducklings of climate modelling. In this particular case, atmospheric changes east of Greenland triggered rapid sea-ice growth.""

As for Dr Mann, he still stands by his work, claims that it is indisputable that carbon dioxide is behind global warming. 

“For more than two centuries we have been increasing the concentration of these gases from fossil fuel burning,” he said.

“What we would not be able to explain, scientifically, would be if the Earth were not warming up.  But measurements tell us that it has warmed up—more than a degree C. It will warm more than 2C in a matter of decades if we don’t bring carbon emissions down dramatically.”

The Sun

The Sun provides most of the energy on Earth and its activity waxes and wanes over an 11 year cycle. Yet within this timeframe, the Sun is constantly changing, largely because of its strange rotation.

The Sun’s equator spins faster than its poles, meaning a day standing at the solar pole would last around 38 Earth days, compared to just 25 days at the equator. The effect of this is to cause the Sun’s magnetic fields to become twisted and warped until they burst out of the surface as sunspots. The number of sunspots peaks every 11 years, hence the cycle. 

In 1893, Edward Maunder, a superintendent of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, was looking through old records when he discovered that between 1645-1715 sunspot activity had come to a virtual standstill. In fact there were fewer sunspots during that period than in an average year today, an effect so striking it was dubbed the Maunder Minimum. 

As we have already seen, during this time, the Northern Hemisphere experienced ‘The Little Ice Age’ where crops failed and plague wiped out tens of millions of people showing a clear correlation between solar activity and temperature on Earth.  Likewise, there was also high solar activity during the Medieval Warm Period.

Some scientists believe that solar activity is more likely to influence today’s climate than carbon dioxide, and Dr Soon has compiled data showing temperature in America, Canada and Mexico rises and falls in line with solar activity.

“The Sun in my opinion is the primary driver of climate change,” he said. “The Sun is the big giant gorilla in the climate system.”

Yet the IPCC insists that solar activity does not account for levels of warming seen at the end of the 20th century. Over the last 35 years the Sun has shown a cooling trend. However global temperatures continue to increase. If the Sun's energy is decreasing while the Earth is warming, then the Sun cannot be the main control of the temperature.

Bob Ward, Policy and Communications Director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics said: “We can measure directly with satellites how the energy of the Sun varies and it does not match changes in the Earth’s temperature.

“The most important and central piece of evidence is that computer models that simulate the Earth’s climate are unable to reproduce the rise in global temperature over the past century just through natural variability, including the Sun’s activity.”

Professor Rowan Sutton, Director of Climate Research in the UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS), added: “Simulations of climate change over the last century are only consistent with the observed warming when they include the rapid increase in greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities.”  

Pressure at the Poles 

A quick glance at satellite images from the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) going back to 1981 shows an undeniable downward trend in Arctic sea ice over the past 35 years.

Predictions by some scientists that the Arctic would be entirely ice free by 2016 have proven too alarmist, but at the current rate Nasa forecasts that The Arctic Ocean will become essentially ice free in summer before mid-century. 

In the 19th century explorers such as Sir John Franklin raced to find a route through the northwest passage, to avoid the lengthy journey around the Americas to reach the Pacific Ocean. But even in the summer the route was blocked by impenetrable ice. 

Today the ice is melting at such a dramatic rate that large shipping companies are considering expanding their routes to the top of the world. 


The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have also decreased in mass. Data from Nasa's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace) satellites show Greenland lost around 286 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 127 billion tons. The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade.

In August 12.5 billion of tons of ice melted in Greenland, allowing children to play in the Arctic sea, as temperatures rose to 71.6F (22C), 27F (15C) higher than average for the summer.

Extreme cases of ice melting typically occur once every 250 years, however the enormous loss of ice on August 1 was the second since 2012. Currently the 2019 loss of Greenland ice sheet mass is lower than 2012, but higher than the 1981-20 mean. 

Glaciers are also retreating almost everywhere around the world including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.

The melting ice has led to global sea level rise of around eight inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880. It is projected to rise another one to four by 2100.


By the end of the century, experts predict that storm surges and high tides could combine with sea level rise to cause flooding in many regions. 

The oceans have absorbed much of the increased heat of recent years, with the top 2,300ft (700m) of ocean  showing warming of more than 0.4F since 1969. And because saltwater expands as it warms, the extra heat is exacerbating sea level rise.

Losing ice cover is important for climate not just because of rising seas but because ice is very good at reflecting back sunlight, a phenomenon known as the albedo effect. Without it, more energy is absorbed from the Sun and climate warms further. 

This positive feedback loop has played a major role in glacial advances and retreats in the past. 

The warming of the Greenland ice sheet is also triggering another phenomenon which could speed up climate change - biological darkening. 

Professor Martyn Tranter of Bristol University’s School of Geographical Sciences said: “The darkening is caused by the numerous glacier algae that grow in this area which are pigmented deep purple to shield their vital elements from the intense ultraviolet radiation in sunlight.

“There are so many of these deep purple algae that they look as black as the soot from tunda fires.”

Scientists at the University of Prague have calculated that algae darkening is responsible for up to 10 per cent of total ice sheet melt each summer because it dims the albedo effect. And as more algae grows, the greater will be the impact.

The ice sheets are also holding one final timebomb. Trapped beneath the permafrost is a huge amount of methane which is unable to travel upwards because of the frozen ground above. If the permafrost melts this powerful greenhouse gas could be released, with some estimates suggesting it could amplify global warming by five per cent.

Methane is especially dangerous, as it can warm the earth 86 times as much as carbon dioxide over 20 years in the atmosphere. Methane can also raise the acidity of the water and kill off sea creatures as it breaks down.  And the ground warms, microbes in the soil may also wake up and start emitting greenhouse gases. 

Experts claim melting permafrost has the potental to release 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide,  more than 40 times as much CO2 as humans released into the atmosphere last year.

Ocean currents 

One of the most influential natural phenomena affecting weather and climate are ocean currents and particularly the ongoing swing between the El Niño and La Niña systems.

El Niño, which is Spanish for ‘the little boy’, was first coined in the 1880s by Peruvian fisherman who noticed that every few years the cold north-flowing current in which they fished would switch to a warm southerly flow. Because it tended to happen around Christmas time, it was named for the infant Jesus.

It wasn’t until the 1970s that satellites picked up the El Niño Southern Oscillation cycle (ENSO) on a global scale.

Usually winds travel westwards over the Pacific picking up warm surface water which accumulates around Indonesia. This removal of warm water triggers deep water to move up to the surface bringing nutrients which attract fish. The accumulation of warm water in the west and colder water in the east sets in motion a convection pattern - known as the Walker Circulation - with air rising over Indonesia and sinking off the west coast of South America, bringing rainfall to the west and clear skies to the east, and conditions known as La Niña.

However if the westerly winds are not strong enough, the warm water moves back, causing the Walker Circulation to break down as warm air begins to rise in the Central pacific, and El Niño occurs. 

Global temperature increases after an El Niño event and the following La Niña event causes it to fall. The warming temperatures around 2016 coincided with an El Niño event.

During the slight cooling period between 1943–1976, there were slightly more La Niña events than El Niño events, while the frequency is roughly equalised during the warming pause from 1998.

In the warming period between 1976– 1998 there El Niño currents were more frequent. But because global warming itself is thought to trigger more El Niño events it is tricky to tease out whether ocean currents are having an impact on global warming or if global warming is leading to more events. 

Dr Mike Rogerson, a Senior Lecturer and Convener of Geochemistry and Geobiology Group at Hull University said: ""There are lots of oscillations like this, but ENSO is the biggest. 

“They change where the heat is, but not how much heat is in the system. When you compute the global mean, they often disappear. Otherwise, they add to the “noise”. 

“The rising temperature we’ve seen in our lifetimes shows there is a massive forcing going on, and the best candidate by far is greenhouse gas forcing. 

“All the other cycles, random changes, events and so on continue though. So even when the forcing is massive, you’ll still get some ups and downs relating to the complexity. ENSO is one such complexity. This is the “noise” which competes with the “signal” of climate change.”

A strange hiatus

The linear relationship between rising carbon dioxide levels and global warming appeared undeniable, until temperature increases began to slow down after 1998 and remained relatively stable for a period of 15 years, even though CO2 continued to rise.

The IPCC and the Met Office acknowledged that there had been a temperature ‘pause’ in the years after 1998 and experts started to question whether major ocean currents were having more influence on climate than models had previously allowed. 

When the IPCC published its Fifth Assessment Report in 2013 the panel concluded that more than 90 per cent of the extra heat trapped through global warming had been absorbed by the oceans. 

Today, the hiatus is still disputed as it is picked up in the Met Office’s compilation of global temperatures but not in the records compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Nasa.

Dr Rogerson added : “I don’t think it is a “hiatus” at all. It is more likely that some change in the Earth system happened in those years and the decade before, and the decade after as well as the warming. 

 “Imagine you are looking at your bank account, and over the years the amount in it slowly falls. You have a problem! Of course, sometimes it might jump up again – each month, when you are paid. When you sell your car. When you make a killing on eBay. When you inherit from a relative. The number in your account has a “hiatus”. 

“Does that mean you are living sustainably during that “hiatus”? No. Is it surprisingly that the world continues, and affects you as time passes – even though you are poor at managing your money? No, it isn’t. You need to change your habits, or face bankruptcy.

Dr Ward added: “The difference is probably due to the way in which these different groups calculate a global average from the worldwide network of weather stations. 

“For instance, a key uncertainty occurs in the polar regions where we do not have many stations. The Met Office largely ignores areas that have no records whereas NOAA and NASA makes assumptions about the rate of warming in those regions. 

“In the end, even if the hiatus did exist it was only temporary and not particularly significant in the overall record. We know that global temperature varies from year to year depending on many natural factors, such as the occurrence of El Niño , but these variations are superimposed on the clear and undeniable warming trend caused by the rise in greenhouse gases.”

Adjustments and manipulations
One of the most devastating blows to the science of climate change came in 2009 when hackers downloaded thousands of emails and computer files from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA).

Contents of the emails suggested scientists had been hiding or manipulating data, preventing people accessing their figures and working to stop papers critical of their findings from being published. 

In one particularly damning email, CRU director Phil Jones said he had used ‘Mike’s Nature trick’ to ‘hide the decline’ in temperatures in the second half of the 20th century.

Just like Dr Mann’s ‘hockey stick’ graph he had cut off the tree-ring data just at the point where it stopped showing an upward trend and swapped in thermometer temperatures for recent decades, making them look much warmer.

In an interview with the BBC after the scandal broke, Dr Jones admitted there had been ‘no statistically significant global warming since 1995.’ Although reviews into Climategate found that the scientists had not acted unethically, Commons Science and Technology Committee member Graham Stringer wrote a minority report saying the inquiries had not been independent. 

The IPCC was also not exempt from misleading the public. The panel was forced to retract a statement in its 2007 report saying all Himalayan glaciers could melt entirely by 2035. 

It later emerged that many of the alarming claims cited in IPCC reports were not based on science but press releases and unfounded reports made by climate activists. One claim, that global warming was threatening to destroy 40 per cent of the Amazon’s rainforest was eventually traced back to a leaflet distributed by a Brazilian environmental group, who were concerned with logging and man-made forest fires, not climate change. 

An investigation into the conduct of the IPCC by the Interacademy Council warned in 2010 that the process of using validated scientific sources must be tightened up. 

The figure traditionally cited that suggests 97 per cent of climate scientists agree that global warming is man-made was also found to be flawed. A survey which claimed to have questioned 10,257 academics, was found to have winnowed down the sample to just 77.

A poll of 1854 members of the American Meteorological Society found the number who believe climate change to be man-made to be 52 per cent.

“The 97 per cent figure is derived from two pieces of pseudoscience that would have embarrassed a homeopath,” said Viscount Ridley in his climate blog.

Climate skeptics argue temperature records have been adjusted in recent years to make the past appear cooler and the present warmer, although the Carbon Brief showed that NOAA has actually made the past warmer, evening out the difference. 

Satellite data from Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) in California initially showed temperatures which largely flatlined from 1998, but that data has since been adjusted to show a warming trend. 

The difference between recorded temperatures and reported temperatures has been slowly rising in recent years.

Confusion peaked in 2014 when surface temperature readings said the year was the hottest on record, while satellites maintained it was cooler than 1998. A look at the figures showed the Met Office dataset ‘HadCRUt’ had been adjusted to show 1998 as cooler. 

Although it might appear scientists are ‘cooking the books’, experts say the shifts are necessary to avoid biases from station relocations, instrument changes, the time of day and the heat island effect. 

“These are done to ensure that temperature measurements can be compared over time,” said Dr Ward.

“For instance, the time of day at which temperature is measured makes a big difference so many previous measurements which were recorded at different times of day have to be adjusted to ensure that they can be compared. 

“When the measuring equipment gets old and need s replacing, it often requires re-calibration. What skeptics often ignore is the fact that the adjustments at a site can go either up or down. Linked to this is the claim that some sites record a warming because they have become urbanised. This is a legitimate concern but these sites are usually excluded from the temperature record as a result.”",very_low,"Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Inappropriate sources, Misleading",1133,"This article in The Telegraph attempts to discuss the science of observed global warming and the factors responsible. However, mixed in with some accurate factual statements are claims that give readers the impression that the answers are unknown, and climate science is “up for debate”.

For example, the article presents the views of one person who claims carbon dioxide has little to do with temperature change, pointing instead to water vapor. Several sentences following this note that water vapor in the atmosphere is controlled by temperature, and so cannot drive a warming trend. However, this is framed as “one scientist says” vs. “some other scientists say”, creating the appearance of scientific debate that doesn’t exist.

So even though the article includes some accurate quotes from climate scientists, overall it elevates many inaccurate claims that are not supported by evidence—like claiming that scientists “have misrepresented the data in the past” or that “solar activity is more likely to influence today’s climate than carbon dioxide”.",,,,,"Zeke Hausfather, Director of Climate and Energy, The Breakthrough Institute","This article is a prime example of false equivalence, putting fringe figures side by side with mainstream scientific findings while failing to distinguish between their respective credibility.

Second, results are taken out of context and/or written in an ambiguous way. For example: “[Sea level rise] is projected to rise another one to four by 2100”. No unit is stated here, but because the previous sentence gave numbers in inches, one would think the sea level is projected to rise 1-4 inches, instead of 1-4 FEET, which is the case according to SROCC2.

The two lower tropospheric records, UAH and RSS, have trends of 0.13C and 0.22C per decade, respectively.",,,,However the warming trend is slower than most climate models have forecast,"This is demonstrably untrue. Firstly, the models from the early 1990s have proven remarkably correct in predicting how surface temperatures have subsequently evolved. But, more prescient is to look at current models.

The single realisation that is the real-world clearly sits well within the spread of solutions predicted by the models. (See e.g.)","This is generally not accurate. When we looked at past climate model forecasts, most were pretty close to what was actually observed. See my Carbon Brief article on the subject for details.

Here is a comparison between observations and the climate models featured in the last IPCC assessment report (CMIP5). Observations are well within the envelope of model projections and, in recent years, are quite close to the multimodel mean:",,,In 1990 the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that temperatures would rise by 0.54F (0.3C) per decade. Skeptics argue that the forecasts were too high because they relied too heavily on the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2).,"The IPCC First Assessment Report projected surface temperature changes of around 0.26C per decade between 1990 and 2017. This compares to observed temperature changes of around 0.19C over the same period. However, the first IPCC report projected that the radiative forcing from greenhouse gases would increase around 55% faster than was actually observed. We can’t expect modelers to have a crystal ball to predict future emissions; indeed, even a perfect physics-based model of the Earth’s climate would produce incorrect results if you get future emissions 50% off. When this mismatch is taken into account, the IPCC First Assessment Report projections are nearly identical to observations.",,,,"Yet, some scientists argue that the gas is not capable of producing the extreme temperature rises seen in recent decades.","In the same way some “scientists” claim quantum mechanics is wrong. Single scientists are not a source of reliable scientific information, especially after searching them out for holding views that reject the scientific understanding of the world.

Normally the reporting in the science section of a reputable newspaper would be based on the overwhelming evidence presented in high quality peer reviewed scientific journals.",,,,"In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010. But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.","This is a gross misrepresentation of the assessment. The relevant finding is: “It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period.” (My italicisation.)

The reporter has picked up a commonly used trick to quote just the first sentence of the key finding. The full finding clearly falsifies the assertion here. The best estimate remains that all the warming seen since the mid-20th Century is down to us.","This is deceptive. Most published work suggests human activities are responsible for all, if not more than 100% of observed warming.","In its 2013 fifth assessment report, the IPCC stated in its summary for policymakers that it is “extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature” from 1951 to 2010 was caused by human activity. By “extremely likely”, it meant that there was between a 95% and 100% probability that more than half of modern warming was due to humans.

This somewhat convoluted statement has been often misinterpreted as implying that the human responsibility for modern warming lies somewhere between 50% and 100%.

In fact, as NASA’s Dr. Gavin Schmidt has pointed out, the IPCC’s implied best guess was that humans were responsible for around 110% of observed warming (ranging from 72% to 146%), with natural factors in isolation leading to a slight cooling over the past 50 years.

For more details, see my Carbon Brief explainer on why the best-estimate of the human contribution is around 100% of observed warming.",,"Even ExxonMobil’s own scientists predicted in 1982 that the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and warming we would see by now if we the world did not curtail fossil fuel burning.

The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is driven by the temperature (for every 1K increase 7% more water can be held) and water has too short lifetime in the atmosphere (think precipitation).,,,,"Scientists such as Dr Willie Soon, a solar astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, have shown that as water vapour rises, so does temperature. It is why cloudless nights are so chilly.","The water vapor feedback is one of the main positive feedbacks in the climate system. It has been well understood for much of the century that increased temperatures will increase the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, trapping additional heat. This is by no means a controversial topic in the scientific community, fringe views by Willie Soon notwithstanding.

Water vapor cannot be a forcing because of its extremely short atmospheric lifetime in the troposphere. Adding a bunch of additional water vapor won’t cause long-term changes, as it will quickly precipitate out. However, the absolute amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is strongly determined by the temperature; warm the planet (e.g. by increasing CO2 concentrations) and you will end up with more water vapor in the air. This is why water vapor is a feedback rather than a forcing.

See for instance Wramneby et al (2010)1: “In the Scandinavian Mountains, reduced albedo resulting from the snow‐masking effect of forest expansion enhanced the winter warming trend. In central Europe, the stimulation of photosynthesis and plant growth by “CO2 fertilization” mitigated warming, through a negative evapotranspiration feedback associated with increased vegetation cover and leaf area index. In southern Europe, increased summer dryness restricted plant growth and survival, causing a positive warming feedback through reduced evapotranspiration.” (abstract)

These other reconstructions do tend to show some more variability than MBH98 (the handle of the hockey stick is not as straight), but they all support the general conclusions that the IPCC TAR presented in 2001: the late 20th century warming is anomalous in the last one or two thousand years and the 1990’s are very likely warmer than any other time in the last one or two thousand years.”","Yet a study published just this week, by the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway, found that the natural climate system can change abruptly, without the need for any external forces.",This falls foul of the single study fallacy. The basis for our understanding is a holistic assessment of multiple lines of evidence. It would take a spectacular new finding to overturn the enormous and compelling body of evidence that underlies our understanding.,The study in question is a regional one—on Arctic glaciers—so is entirely consistent with what has already been explained and not an example to the contrary as the opener “Yet” implies.,"Its unclear what study they are referring to here, as they only link to the front page of the Bjerknes Centre. Ironically, the story currently there states that:

“A warm period is occurring across the whole world for the first time in at least 2000 years. The cold and warm climatic phases of the past 2000 years were not, as previously assumed, global phenomena. The climate varied greatly from region to region. That’s according to a study by the University of Bern that has just been published in Nature. In contrast to earlier times, current, anthropogenic climate change is occurring across the whole world at the same time.”",,"Some scientists believe that solar activity is more likely to influence today’s climate than carbon dioxide, and Dr Soon has compiled data showing temperature in America, Canada and Mexico rises and falls in line with solar activity.","This is a very fringe view in the scientific community. The fact that Soon is cherry-picking three regions instead of looking at global temperatures is a clear sign of the weakness of his argument. He is also using a quite outdated solar irradiance estimate at odds with modern solar research.

There is a weak relationship between changes in solar output and global temperatures in the historical temperature record. In fact, the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth has slightly declined since 1970 during the period over which we’ve seen rapid global warming. The figure below shows global temperatures and solar irradiance over the century:

We also see a strong anthropogenic fingerprint of warming: the troposphere is warming while the stratosphere is cooling. See my Carbon Brief post on the subject for details.",Soon’s minority views on sunspots being responsible for global warming are juxtaposed against those of the IPCC that it is not.,"Once again, after decrying the misuse of correlations earlier in the article, Willie Soon presents nothing more than the covariance of solar irradiance and temperature in one region.","Firstly, the correlation isn’t particularly compelling. But secondly, why choose daily high temperature over Mexico? It smacks of a very spectacular cherry-pick. Searching over enough regions and metrics and playing the wiggle matching game, one could likely create similarly impressive graphs for any posited mechanism somewhere on Earth. But that doesn’t mean that there is a meaningful link between the two.",Predictions by some scientists that the Arctic would be entirely ice free by 2016 have proven too alarmist,The “predictions by some scientists” were again personal statements and not the model predictions of the time; even then the experiments done by IPCC suggested mid-century.,,,,Today the ice is melting at such a dramatic rate that large shipping companies are considering expanding their routes to the top of the world.,Not just large ships.

Letter signed by “500 scientists” relies on inaccurate claims about climate science,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/letter-signed-by-500-scientists-relies-on-inaccurate-claims-about-climate-science/,There is no climate emergency,https://clintel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ED-brochureversieNWA4.pdf,"A global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message. Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific. Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.
Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warming
The geological archive reveals that Earth’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, with natural cold and warm phases. The Little Ice Age
ended as recently as 1850. Therefore, it is no surprise that we now are expe riencing a period of warming. Only very few peer-reviewed papers even go so far as to say that recent warming is chiefly anthropogenic.
Warming is far slower than predicted
The world has warmed at less than half the originally-predicted rate, and at less than half the rate to be expected on the basis of net anthropogenic forcing and radiative imbalance. It tells us that we are far from understanding climate change.
Climate policy relies on inadequate models
Climate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as policy tools. Moreover, they most likely exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2. In addition, they ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial. 
CO2 is plant food, the basis of all life on Earth
CO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide.
Global warming has not increased natural disasters
There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent. However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and insects, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests.
Climate policy must respect scientific and economic realities
There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. If better approaches emerge, we will have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times, and throughout the world.",very_low,"Biased, Cherry-picking, Inaccurate, Misleading",28457,"This letter presenting a short list of claims about climate change boasts a list of “500 scientists and professionals” who have co-signed it.

This is false, as many climate models simulate the response of vegetation to increased CO2—and the climate change it causes.

And while some outlets described the co-signers as experts in climate science, most are not. As noted in an analysis below, a significant portion of the co-signers are either engineers or professionals in non-technical fields. Only 10 identified themselves as climate scientists.

The last two statements are based on literature and common knowledge, but qualify as cherry-picking because they omit most negative effects of CO2 increase and warming (e.g. other clear trends in extreme events, damage to forests and crops by drought and heat waves).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message.,"While reviewing the claims related to agriculture, I noted that only 26 out of the 506 signatories (5%) were professionals in biology, ecology, or environmental science. I suspect that the vast majority of signatories had little direct knowledge or understanding of this part of the petition that they signed. This made me curious to delve more deeply into the makeup of the signatory list.

I usually try to steer clear of any ad hominem tactics, and instead evaluate claims solely on their own merits. However, the fact that this group is vocally promoting themselves as “knowledgeable and experienced scientists and professionals in climate and related fields” made me wonder if that claim is actually supported by the signatories’ credentials. In a word, the answer is no.

I categorized all 506 signatories according to their self-identified field of expertise. Only 10 identified as climate scientists, and 4 identified as meteorologists. (Together, that’s 2.8% of the total.) Signatories in totally unrelated academic fields (for example, psychology, philosophy, archaeology, and law) outnumbered climate scientists by two to one.

The most prevalent groups of signatories were geologists (19%) and engineers (21%)—many of whom were implicitly or explicitly involved in fossil energy extraction. Most of the rest were physicists, chemists, and mathematicians. A large fraction of the signatories were not scientists, but rather business executives, writers, activists, and lobbyists (totaling 11.3%).

I also noticed a peculiar omission in the list of signatories: women. Among the 506 names, only 24 were female names (with another 15 that were initials-only or unisex). That means that about 95% of the signers were men. Even for male-heavy fields such as geology and engineering, this is a staggering imbalance. I suspect that the imbalance may have been heightened by the fact that the signers skewed heavily toward the older generation – for example, there were 79 emeritus professors on the list (16% of the total).

Again, I’d prefer to evaluate claims on their own merits. But if the ECD group is going to tout their own credentials, then it needs to be pointed out that a large fraction of their 506 signatories have credentials like “Peter Champness, Radiologist, Australia”; “Patrick Mellett, architect and CEO”; and “Fintan Ryan, Retired Senior Airline Captain” (to say nothing of the dozens and dozens of fossil fuel employees).",,,,"The geological archive reveals that Earth’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, with natural cold and warm phases.","That demonstrates that the climate can change. Those past changes also provide science with many independent ways to estimate how much the climate will change due to human emissions of greenhouse gases.

Just like people dying naturally is no reason to acquit a murder suspect, the recent warming of the Earth is basically all due to our activities and will only change if we change them.","It is accurate that the Earth’s climate has experienced natural variability including warm and cold phases. However, the crux is that these changes have NOT happened with human populations at a level even remotely approaching today’s population and development levels. The world population reached 1 billion in ~1800 (link) and climate within the 1000-800 years-before-present timescale was quite stable. Human populations, economies, infrastructure, development have formed during a period of climate stability.",,,"The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850. Therefore, it is no surprise that we now are experiencing a period of warming","The current period of warming is not because the Little Ice Age ended by 1850. Climate scientists study the causes of warming and cooling period and calculate their effects on our climate. These studies show that natural warming after the Little Ice Age was complete by the late 1800s. The warming from the late 1800s to the present is all due to human-caused climate change, because natural factors have changed little since then and even would have caused a slight cooling over the last 70 years rather than the warming we have observed.

See Figures 3b and 6c of Tett et al (2007)1 for example.

Most papers on climate change do not state that recent warming is chiefly anthropogenic because the anthropogenic driver is noncontroversial. Most papers are trying to document how fast change is happening and how it compares to model expectations for fossil-fuel driven global warming.,"As noted, this is false. The role of humans is well established, and has been for a number of decades. An example of what the climate would look like without anthropogenic forcing is available in this IPCC figure.",,,"Warming is far slower than predicted. The world has warmed at less than half the originally-predicted rate, and at less than half the rate to be expected on the basis of net anthropogenic forcing and radiative imbalance.","This statement is at odds with comparisons between the warming we have observed and the warming predicted by climate models. These comparisons show good agreement and do not support the claim that warming is far slower than predicted.

For an example of the agreement between observed and predicted warming, see Fig. 4b of Cowtan et al (2015)1","The rate is very similar to the projections made by Hansen et al (1988)1. For readers’ information, the largest uncertainty about how the climate will change is how humans will emit in the future.

Here are a few of those milestones:

1859 – John Tyndall discovers that some gases block infrared radiation. He suggests that changes in the concentration of the gases could bring climate change.

1896 – Svante Arrhenius publishes first calculation of global warming from human emissions of CO2: doubling the CO2 in the atmosphere would raise global temp some 5-6°C (9-11°F)

If a pollutant is something that causes adverse effects on natural and human systems, then CO2 is a pollutant when it is increased rapidly in the Earth’s atmosphere and increases the risks of damaging effects.

See here for an explanation.","The more important note is that CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Thus, it is able to change the atmosphere’s ability to absorb solar radiation and increase temperatures.",,,[CO2] is essential to all life on Earth.,"Nutrients are also essential for life. A farmer can still over-dung their fields. Too much nutrients cause algae blooms and is a major reason for biodiversity losses.

The natural CO2 concentration and its natural greenhouse effect are great for life on Earth and keeps the Earth at a pleasant temperature. That does not mean that increasing the CO2 concentration is a good thing.

To conclude, this argument makes no sense.",,,,"More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide","This claim is misleading. In a meta-analysis of over 1,000 studies of the effects of climate change on agriculture[1], we find that, while CO2 is beneficial for crops, this effect rapidly decreases with increasing concentrations. The net effects of climate change on agriculture, including both the benefits of CO2 fertilization and the negative effects of warming, is negative for almost all regions. The effects of CO2 emissions on agriculture cost approximately $8.5 per ton, even accounting for the positive effects of CO2 fertilization.

1- Moore et al (2017) New science of climate change impacts on agriculture implies higher social cost of carbon, Nature","CO2 is not a pollutant in the sense of being acutely toxic to life, but this framing is highly misleading. Water is also non-toxic and essential to life on Earth, but too much water in the wrong places can be devastating.

Natural ecosystems

The claim that “more CO2 is beneficial for nature” implies that the purpose of nature is simply to produce as much plant biomass as possible, a supposition that would be challenged by every ecologist I know. Dumping a limiting resource into a natural ecosystem is not something to celebrate. In that respect, adding CO2 to the atmosphere is somewhat similar in concept to adding nitrogen and phosphorus to waterways: it stimulates primary production, but it disrupts biogeochemical cycles and species relationships.

Although increasing CO2 does tend to stimulate terrestrial plant growth (if you ignore effects of CO2 on temperature and soil moisture), the stimulation is not necessarily a good thing for ecosystems as a whole. CO2 enrichment benefits some plant species while disadvantaging others (due to shifts in competitive dynamics, especially between C3 and C4 plants). Furthermore, plant biomass grown under high CO2 is less digestible, less nutritious, and slower to decompose. Changes in the quality and quantity of plant biomass also have hard-to-predict effects on animal populations, fungal and microbial activity, and soil composition. If only it were as simple as “greening the Earth,” but it’s not.

The only silver lining is that, because CO2 does tend to stimulate plant growth, carbon sequestration in plant biomass provides a negative feedback to our CO2 emissions. (This is already accounted for by many models.) But to say that plants help make our CO2 emissions slightly less harmful is not to say that we should be complacent about the emissions in the first place.

Agricultural ecosystems

Regarding “It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide”: There is some truth to this claim, but this description is dangerously oversimplified.

First, although controlled studies in the lab, greenhouse, and field do show that CO2 stimulates crop growth and yield, the effect diminishes after several weeks or months of CO2 treatment, once the individual plants acclimate. Many questions still remain about how the “CO2 acclimation effect” works in different species and under different conditions, but it is clear that extrapolating from short-term greenhouse experiments to long-term agricultural production is unwarranted.

Second, even aside from the CO2 acclimation effect, it is uncertain how much of the potential gain from CO2 fertilization would be realized in the real world—which not only has other limiting resources such as nitrogen and water, but which would also include higher average temperatures and more extreme events. This is why many scientists who model crop yield under future climate choose not to include the CO2 fertilization effect. (Some choose to report multiple model runs that both do and don’t include the CO2 effect.)

Third, and most importantly, the positive and negative effects of climate change on agriculture will not be felt equally around the world. Wealthy temperate regions will not see much harm, and may even see a net benefit, from warmer temperatures and increased CO2. But the opposite will be true of developing regions in the tropics, which do not stand to benefit from warming and will likely suffer from high temperatures and drought. Worldwide, the net effect might be very roughly neutral (probably slightly negative, depending on mitigation and adaptation efforts). But this is not a reason to be complacent, because those who stand to lose the most are also the most vulnerable.

In summary, regarding the European Climate Declaration’s claims on plant growth and agriculture, It is both scientifically and ethically indefensible for representatives from wealthy temperate countries to tell the rest of the world that there is nothing to worry about.","This statement is based on selective misuse of evidence. There are benefits of CO2 for vegetation growth (though these benefits are often overstated) but these benefits will likely be limited by nutrient shortage and they may be overcome by changes in climate (e.g. increased drought) caused by the same increases in CO2.

For example, IPCC AR5 WGI Chapter 61 reported that “It is very likely… that nutrient shortage will limit the effect of rising atmospheric CO2 on future land carbon sinks”.

1-IPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis","Unfortunately, the issue at hand is not isolated to additional CO2 in the atmosphere. Decision makers must address the full suite of changing that occur with climate change, including temperature and precipitation change, nutrient availability, etc. All crops will not respond the same to climate change, but overall global decreases in crop yield and reductions in food security are actually a major concern. This paper1 provides an example of research on the influence of climate change on crop yield.

Washington Examiner op-ed cherry-picks data and misleads readers about climate models,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-examiner-op-ed-cherry-picks-data-to-mislead-readers-about-climate-models-patrick-michaels-caleb-stewart-rossiter/,The great failure of the climate models,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-great-failure-of-the-climate-models,"Computer models of the climate are at the heart of calls to ban the cheap, reliable energy that powers our thriving economy and promotes healthier, longer lives. For decades, these models have projected dramatic warming from small, fossil-fueled increases in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, with catastrophic consequences.

Yet, the real-world data aren’t cooperating. They show only slight warming, mostly at night and in winter. According to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events, and the ongoing rise in sea level that began with the end of the ice age continues with no great increase in magnitude. The constancy of land-based records is obvious in data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Should we trust these computer models of doom? Let’s find out by comparing the actual temperatures since 1979 with what the 32 families of climate models used in the latest U.N. report on climate science predicted they would be.

Atmospheric scientist John Christy developed a global temperature record of the lower atmosphere using highly accurate satellite soundings. NASA honored him for this achievement, and he was an author for a previous edition of the U.N. report. He told a House Science Committee hearing in March 2017 that the U.N. climate models have failed badly.

Christy compared the average model projections since 1979 to the most reliable observations — those made by satellites and weather balloons over the vast tropics. The result? In the upper levels of the lower atmosphere, the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed. Overprediction also occurred at all other levels. Christy recently concluded that, on average, the projected heating by the models is three times what has been observed.

This is a critical error. Getting the tropical climate right is essential to understanding climate worldwide. Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean, and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere. That’s important. Most of Earth’s agriculture is dependent upon the transfer of moisture from the tropics to temperate regions.


Christy is not looking at surface temperatures, as measured by thermometers at weather stations. Instead, he is looking at temperatures measured from calibrated thermistors carried by weather balloons and data from satellites. Why didn’t he simply look down here, where we all live? Because the records of the surface temperatures have been badly compromised.

Globally averaged thermometers show two periods of warming since 1900: a half-degree from natural causes in the first half of the 20th century, before there was an increase in industrial carbon dioxide that was enough to produce it, and another half-degree in the last quarter of the century.

The latest U.N. science compendium asserts that the latter half-degree is at least half manmade. But the thermometer records showed that the warming stopped from 2000 to 2014. Until they didn’t. In two of the four global surface series, data were adjusted in two ways that wiped out the “pause” that had been observed.

The first adjustment changed how the temperature of the ocean surface is calculated, by replacing satellite data with drifting buoys and temperatures in ships’ water intake. The size of the ship determines how deep the intake tube is, and steel ships warm up tremendously under sunny, hot conditions. The buoy temperatures, which are measured by precise electronic thermistors, were adjusted upwards to match the questionable ship data. Given that the buoy network became more extensive during the pause, that’s guaranteed to put some artificial warming in the data.

The second big adjustment was over the Arctic Ocean, where there aren’t any weather stations. In this revision, temperatures were estimated from nearby land stations. This runs afoul of basic physics.

Even in warm summers, there’s plenty of ice over much of the Arctic Ocean. Now, for example, when the sea ice is nearing its annual minimum, it still extends part way down Greenland’s east coast. As long as the ice-water mix is well-stirred (like a glass of ice water), the surface temperature stays at the freezing point until all the ice melts. So, extending land readings over the Arctic Ocean adds nonexistent warming to the record.

Further, both global and United States data have been frequently adjusted. There is nothing scientifically wrong with adjusting data to correct for changes in the way temperatures are observed and for changes in the thermometers. But each serial adjustment has tended to make the early years colder, which increases the warming trend. That’s wildly improbable.

In addition, thermometers are housed in standardized instrument shelters, which are to be kept a specified shade of white. Shelters in poorer countries are not repainted as often, and darker stations absorb more of the sun’s energy. It’s no surprise that poor tropical countries show the largest warming from this effect.

All this is to say that the weather balloon and satellite temperatures used in Christy’s testimony are the best data we have, and they show that the U.N.’s climate models just aren’t ready for prime time.",very_low,"Biased, Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",338,"This op-ed article published by The Washington Examiner (and republished by Zero Hedge) claims to provide evidence that climate models are not valid scientific tools able to inform decisions about climate change by focusing on a comparison with specific datasets from the upper atmosphere in the tropics.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that it is highly misleading, including a number of false factual assertions, cherry-picking datasets that support their point, failing to account for uncertainties in those datasets, and failing to assess the performance of climate models in an objective and rigorous manner.",,,,,"Stephen Po-Chedley, Research Scientist, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","This article focuses only on specific lines of evidence that climate models disagree with observations. In doing so, the authors ignore research that helps to reconcile differences between models and observations. The authors do not consider alternate datasets and time periods in which models and observations agree. Models are one tool for understanding climate change; their overall credibility does not hinge on one variable, in one domain, over a specific time period, with respect to a set of imperfect observations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Computer models of the climate are at the heart of calls to ban the cheap, reliable energy that powers our thriving economy and promotes healthier, longer lives.","Assessments of climate change include many lines of evidence. In addition to computer models, observations of many aspects of the climate (e.g. changes in land and sea ice, sea level rise, temperature, humidity, etc.) and paleoclimate evidence is considered.","No. Climate models are one source of information, but the basis of concern about climate change comes from our understanding of the fundamental physics of the atmosphere.","Also, without numerical computer models we have many lines of evidence that climate change is a problem (basic physics, observed changes, climatic changes in the deep past). The uncertainties and thus the risks would be higher. There would thus be a greater urgency to reduce risks without climate models.",,"[data] show only slight warming, mostly at night and in winter","This is something that is also simulated in climate models (larger warming in the minimum daily temperature than the maximum daily temperature).

The article the authors reference tends to focus on smaller spatial scales where natural variability plays a larger role. On a global scale, the seasonal asymmetry in warming rates appears to be small. Taking global GISTEMP trends over 1950 – 2018 the range of trends for all seasons is 0.13 – 0.15 degrees C per decade.

It is likely that sea level rise has an anthropogenic contribution from Greenland melt since 1990 and from glacier mass loss since 1960s. Observations since 1971 indicate with high confidence that thermal expansion and glaciers (excluding the glaciers in Antarctica) explain 75% of the observed rise.”

These records are useful, but have substantial uncertainty.

In the State of the Climate Report1, various estimates of tropical tropospheric warming had a range of 0.12 – 0.22 K / decade across four datasets (that all use the same underlying satellite data). This is nearly a factor of two difference in the long-term rate of warming. This “structural uncertainty” results because researchers use different approaches to remove known biases that affect long-term trends. No method is perfect, which leads to widely varying estimates of atmospheric warming.

They have the largest issues with lack of independent data to check against, and different groups come up with temperature trends that are far more different than the surface temperature records.","These are hardly the most reliable measurements. For a description of the tortured history of the satellite measurements, see page 8 of this document.

In fact, the surface temperature record is much more reliable and the models agree well with it. It’s as likely that unresolved errors in the satellite record are responsible for the errors as problems in the models.","Beware of cherry-picking: It is not established that satellites are the “most reliable” observations, that the tropics are the best domain with which to compare observations or models, or that we should only consider post-1979 satellite era data.",This plot hides the large differences between these highly uncertain estimates by only showing the average.,the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed,"The op-ed authors reference the 2017 State of the Climate Report. I helped prepare the “Lower and Mid-Tropospheric Temperature” section and it is unclear where the authors’ statistic comes from (“seven times as much warming…”).

The average CMIP5 model warming in the tropical troposphere does outpace observations (by a factor of 1.5 – 3.3, depending on dataset). This issue deserves (and has received) scrutiny.1,2,3,4,5,6

The difference in warming rates between observations and models largely arises in the early 2000s. A number of assessments have concluded that this slowdown in warming in the 2000s is in part due to natural variability (the Earth’s warming was slowed due to climate variability) and forcing (the real world experienced different solar and volcanic aerosol forcing than what was used in the models). Models do simulate natural “hiatus” periods like that experienced in the early 2000s, but, since they are random, they generally do not occur at the same times as in the real world (though some models happened to have a slowdown in warming in the early 2000s). Furthermore, forcing agents (greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar changes) are prescribed to models. Since we do not know the exact evolution of forcing agents for future projections, they are estimated. In this case, the estimated forcing was different than what occurred in the real world.

When these issues are taken into account, models and observations are in agreement. Over long periods, when natural variability is a smaller issue, models and observations agree on the rate of warming. Assessments of model projections of climate change show that models have typically been quite skillful (e.g. here).

If the disagreement were in the polar regions, they’d be talking about how important it is to get the polar regions right. Obviously, you want to get everything right, but we live on the surface, so getting that right is the most important—and the models do that.","So apparently the previous paragraph is not just about the upper atmosphere at around 10 km height, but also just about the tropics.

Popular article in The Independent accurately summarizes June heat in Europe,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/popular-article-in-the-independent-accurately-summarizes-june-heat-in-europe-conrad-duncan/,"June was hottest ever recorded on Earth, European satellite agency announces",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/june-hottest-month-ever-earth-2019-weather-heatwave-hot-a8984691.html,"Last month was the hottest June ever recorded, the EU‘s satellite agency has announced.

Data provided by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts on behalf of the EU, showed that the global average temperature for June 2019 was the highest on record for the month.

The data showed European average ​temperatures were more than 2C above normal and temperatures were 6-10C above normal over most of France, Germany and northern Spain during the final days of the month, according to C3S.


The global average temperature was about 0.1C higher than during the previous warmest June in 2016.

Experts have said climate change made last week’s record-breaking European heatwave at least five times as likely to happen, according to recent analysis.

Rapid assessment of average temperatures in France between 26-28 June showed a “substantial” increase in the likelihood of the heatwave happening as a result of human-caused global warming, experts at the World Weather Attribution group said.

The recent heatwave saw France record the hottest temperature in the country’s history (45.9C) and major wildfires across Spain, where temperatures exceeded 40C.

Germany, Poland and Czech Republic also recorded their highest temperatures for June last week.

C3S admitted it is difficult to directly link the heatwave to climate change but noted that such extreme weather events are expected to become more common due to global warming.

Jean-Noel Thepaut, head of C3S, said: ”Although local temperatures may have been lower or higher than those forecast, our data shows that the temperatures over the southwestern region of Europe during the last week of June were unusually high.

“Although this was exceptional, we are likely to see more of these events in the future due to climate change.”

Peter Stott, an expert in analysing the role of climate change in extreme weather​ at the Met Office, claimed that “a similarly extreme heatwave 100 years ago would have likely been around 4C cooler”.

Spikes in European average temperatures of more than 1C above normal have occurred before, such as in 1917 and 1999, but C3S said the recent heatwave was notable because the sudden increase came on top of a general rise of around 1.5C in European temperature over the past 100 years.

In response to the record-breaking heat, Professor Hannah Cloke, natural hazards researcher at the University of Reading, said: “We knew June was hot in Europe, but this study shows that temperature records haven’t just been broken. They have been obliterated.

“This is the hottest June on record in Europe by a country mile, and the warmest June we have ever seen globally.

“Heatwaves occur in any climate, but we know that heatwaves are becoming much more likely due to climate change. The global climate just keeps getting hotter, as greenhouse gases continue to build up, as scientists have predicted for decades.”

However, she added: “Rapid attempts to find links between climate change and single extreme weather events are possible, but often come with many caveats. We should be careful not to ignore these caveats when we look at the conclusions of quick-turnaround attribution studies.”",very_high,Accurate,155,"This article in The Independent covers the release of June monthly average temperature data for Europe—which shows it was the warmest June on record by a significant margin—as well as an analysis of how climate change contributed to the extreme heat wave at the end of the month.

Financial Post commentary jumps to unsupported conclusions in claiming “climate change isn’t causing extreme weather”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/financial-post-commentary-misrepresents-scientific-understanding-of-weather-extremes-ross-mckitrick/,This scientist proved climate change isn’t causing extreme weather — so politicians attacked,https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/ross-mckitrick-this-scientist-proved-climate-change-isnt-causing-extreme-weather-so-politicians-attacke,"This week in Vancouver, Prime Minister Trudeau said the federal carbon tax, a key pillar in his government’s climate policy, will help protect Canadians from extreme weather. “Extreme weather events are extraordinarily expensive for Canadians, our communities and our economy,” he said, citing the recent tornadoes in Ottawa and wildfires in Western Canada. “That’s why we need to act.”

While members of the media may nod along to such claims, the evidence paints a different story. Roger Pielke Jr. is a scientist at University of Colorado in Boulder who, up until a few years ago, did world-leading research on climate change and extreme weather. He found convincing evidence that climate change was not leading to higher rates of weather-related damages worldwide, once you correct for increasing population and wealth. He also helped convene major academic panels to survey the evidence and communicate the near-unanimous scientific consensus on this topic to policymakers. For his efforts, Pielke was subjected to a vicious, well-funded smear campaign backed by, among others, the Obama White House and leading Democratic congressmen, culminating in his decision in 2015 to quit the field.

A year ago, Pielke told the story to an audience at the University of Minnesota. His presentation was recently circulated on Twitter. With so much misinformation nowadays about supposed climate emergencies, it’s worth reviewing carefully.

Pielke’s public presentation begins with a recounting of his rise and fall in the field. As a young researcher in tropical storms and climate-related damages, he reached the pinnacle of the academic community and helped organize the so-called Hohenkammer Consensus Statement, named after the German town where 32 of the leading scientists in the field gathered in 2006 to sort out the evidence. They concluded that trends toward rising climate damages were mainly due to increased population and economic activity in the path of storms, that it was not currently possible to determine the portion of damages attributable to greenhouse gases, and that they didn’t expect that situation to change in the near future.

Shortly thereafter, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its 2007 report, largely agreeing with the Hohenkammer Consensus, while cherry-picking one unpublished study (and highlighting it in the Summary for Policymakers) that suggested a link between greenhouse gases and storm-related damages. But the author of that study — who just happened to be the same IPCC lead author who injected it into the report — later admitted his claim was incorrect, and when the study was finally published, denied the connection.

In 2012, the IPCC Special Report on Extreme Weather came out and echoed the Hohenkammer Consensus, concluding that once you adjust for population growth and economic changes, there is no statistical connection between climate change and measures of weather-related damages. In 2013 Pielke testified to the United States Congress and relayed the IPCC findings. Shortly thereafter, Obama’s science advisor John Holdren accused him of misleading Congress and launched a lengthy but ill-informed attack on Pielke, which prompted congressional Democrats to open an investigation into Pielke’s sources of funding (which quickly fizzled amid benign conclusions). Meanwhile heavily funded left-wing groups succeeded in getting him fired from a popular internet news platform. In 2015 Pielke quit the climate field.

So where did the science end up?

In the second half of his talk, Pielke reviews the science as found in the most recent (2013) IPCC Assessment Report, the 2018 U.S. National Climate Assessment, and the most up-to-date scientific data and literature. Nothing substantial has changed.

Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods. Some regions experience more, some less and some no trend. Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another. There’s no trend in U.S. hurricane landfall frequency or intensity. If anything, the past 50 years has been relatively quiet. There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S. Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally. Since 1965, more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase. And from 1940 to today, flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent.

And on it goes. There’s no trend in U.S. tornado damage (in fact, 2012 to 2017 was below average). There’s no trend in global droughts. Cold snaps in the U.S. are down but, unexpectedly, so are heatwaves.

The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and many major indicators of extreme weather that politicians keep talking about, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, rainfall and floods, despite Trudeau’s claims to the contrary. The continual claim of such links is misinformation employed for political and rhetorical purposes. Powerful people get away with it because so few people know what the numbers show. Many scientists who know better remain silent. And the few who push back against the propaganda, such as Roger Pielke Jr., find themselves on the receiving end of abuse and career-threatening attacks, even though they have all the science in their corner. Something has gotten scary and extreme, but it isn’t the weather.

• Ross McKitrick is a professor of economics at the University of Guelph and senior fellow of the Fraser Institute.

Editor’s note: This article has been updated from its original version to specifically identify the major extreme weather indicators that have been shown to have no solid connection to climate change.",low,"Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Misleading",477,"This op-ed published by the Financial Post, written by Ross McKitrick, describes a presentation by University of Colorado Boulder researcher Roger Pielke, Jr. The article misrepresents analyses of trends in US weather extreme damages as indicators of global trends in the weather extremes, themselves.

Researchers who reviewed the article explained that the US is not representative of the entire world. Trends in weather extremes are not always apparent from limited historical data, and can vary by region. Assessing observed trends is one piece of research on this topic, but an understanding of the physics of these weather events can also enable projections of future behavior that must also be considered. Overall, the evidence highlighted in the article—about certain types of extreme weather in some regions of the world—does not support its conclusion that “climate change isn’t causing extreme weather”.",,,,,"Andreas Prein, Project Scientist, National Center for Atmospheric Research","This article is misleading since it confuses changes in climate change impacts with changes in climate and weather extremes and it subjectively selects examples that support its message.

There is clear scientific evidence that many weather and climate extreme events increase in intensity and frequency due to anthropogenic climate change. Munich Re, for example, publishes data on global major extreme events in its annual reports.

While the number of geophysical extreme events (e.g. earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes) has stayed constant during the period 1980 to 2017, hydrologic extreme events and meteorological extremes increased significantly. The article is correct that increasing population and development is a primary contributor to increasing losses from extreme events. However, there is overwhelming evidence that climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of, specifically heat, coastal flooding, and rainfall-related extreme events1.

IPCC (2012) Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation","Marlene Klockmann, Postdoctoral research fellow, Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht","The arguments in this article are misleading for three reasons: (1) they mix the cost of the damage by extreme events with the actual physical phenomenon of the extreme event, (2) they only focus on data from the US, which is not representative of evidence in other regions, and (3) they completely ignore insights from climate projections, which are very clear on the link between global warming and an increase in extreme events.","Ken Caldeira, Senior Scientist, Carnegie Institution for Science","The central claim in the story is that “climate change was not leading to higher rates of weather-related damages worldwide, once you correct for increasing population and wealth.”

Damage occurs when vulnerable infrastructure is exposed to bad weather, so the economic damage relates as much to the type of infrastructure as it does to the weather, so I will focus on the question of whether we have been seeing changes in extreme weather.

The Earth has been getting hotter, so certainly in terms of global and annual averages, the global weather has been getting more extreme. Further, many more places have been experiencing more extreme heat than would be expected by chance alone, so it is fairly safe to say that human-induced climate change has in many places been causing an increase in the frequency of extremely hot weather.

Storms are not like daily high temperatures, they occur sporadically and are difficult to forecast far in advance. That is, even if there were an increasing trend, it might not be possible to detect the climate signal through the randomness of weather. There is limited evidence supporting the idea that intense storms are becoming more frequent.

Studies of individual storms using computer models, where the storm conditions are simulated as observed and then again with the cooler sea-surface temperatures that would have prevailed in the absence of fossil-fuel CO2 emissions, have concluded that warmer sea surface temperatures are leading to stronger storms. However, if this signal is real, it is hard to detect in century scale trends in weather statistics.

While claims that extreme weather events are related to climate change in popular discourse often goes beyond the available data, we might want to be equally cautious in claiming that some extreme events are unrelated to climate change. (This climate.gov article gives some useful context.)

Sometimes we have data like this:

Can we say that that 2015 precipitation was not a consequence of climate change because there is no significant preceding trend, or do we say that the 2015 event was likely caused by climate change because there was no historical precedent? Obviously, the case is not clear. There are many people who today tend to attribute such anomalous events to climate change, regardless of a lack of underlying mechanistic understanding.

Uncertainty is not our friend. Uncertainty means that we are exposing ourselves to risk.

My general rule of thumb is: “If some weather happens that has never happened before, there is a good chance that climate change has played a role.” This is not a scientific finding but an exhibition of my personal bias. Of course, others may have different priors.

To get a broader perspective, people should be looking to the 2016 National Academy Report on Attribution of Extreme Weather Events in the Context of Climate Change to see what scientists really think, as reflected in a well-respected consensus process:

The figure below (from that report) shows that confidence on attributing changes in extreme hot and cold events to climate change is fairly high, but that the confidence level goes down the less the event has to do with temperature and the more it has to do with the hydrological cycle—and “severe convective storms” is the type of extreme event listed that has the lowest level of understanding and lowest confidence in attribution to climate change.

Another useful report is Chapter 18 of the 2015 IPCC AR5 Working Group II report, also the product of a highly respected consensus process.

It should be noted that in the Technical Summary to Chapter 18, there was no reference to increases in intense storms, and while there is evidence of increased storminess in some regions such a trend is not yet statistically significant at global scale.

McKitrick does a service by calling attention to the relatively weak observation-based evidence for association of damage from extreme weather with climate change. Regardless of whether or not the reader finds compelling the evidence that climate change is increasing the number of intense storms, it is clear that climate change has been increasing the number of record hot days and heat spells. Thus the statements “Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events” and “The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather” would need to be regarded as false.

We can be fairly sure that with continued greenhouse gas emissions, future weather will contain many days that are outside of today’s range of normal weather variability, so we know that the number of “extreme” weather days will increase. There are questions regarding the extent to which we can detect that increases in extremes are already happening and the extent to which we can project the amount of climate damage associated with increases in these extremes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This scientist proved climate change isn’t causing extreme weather,"This is misleading. The main argument of Pielke’s presentation at the University of Minnesota, the Hohenkammer Consensus Statement, and the IPCC reports is that the increasing COST due to extreme weather cannot be linked to climate change.","The title is misleading. He didn’t prove anything. He’s simply claiming there are not yet definitive links between climate change and some extreme events. I would refer the readers to the most recent National Climate Assessment1 for a broader and longer list of salient impacts of climate change beyond the short and narrow selection quoted.

1 – US NCA (2018) Volume II: Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States","The headline of this piece is incorrect. Nobody has “proved climate change isn’t causing extreme weather.” While just about everybody acknowledges that climate change is causing more record high temperatures and fewer record cold temperatures, the jury still is out on whether it can be said that climate change is causing other kinds of extreme weather, such as intense storms.

There is a tendency by many to attribute every extreme event to climate change, and while that is not justified, in most cases of extreme weather there is insufficient data and understanding to make a clear determination of the extent to which climate change may or may not have played a role.",,"While members of the media may nod along to such claims [about changes in weather extremes], the evidence paints a different story",This is again misleading. The evidence that is mentioned in this article is only one part of the complete picture. It focuses only on North America and only on the observational period. It neglects observational evidence from other regions in the world and the insights from climate projections.,,,,"They concluded that trends toward rising climate damages were mainly due to increased population and economic activity in the path of storms, that it was not currently possible to determine the portion of damages attributable to greenhouse gases, and that they didn’t expect that situation to change in the near future.","This is true, but it is only one of 20 conclusions from the Hohenkammer Statement. Another conclusion, for example, is: “For future decades the IPCC (2001) expects increases in the occurrence and/or intensity of some extreme events as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Such increases will further increase losses in the absence of disaster reduction measures.”",,,,"Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods. Some regions experience more, some less and some no trend. Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another.

And from 1940 to today, flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent.","This is more or less a summary of the data cited in Pielke’s presentation and probably accurate. But as mentioned above, it does not give the whole picture.

(1) The observational data for the US does not reflect changes in other regions. Heat waves in other regions can, for example, already be linked to climate change: “It is
very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. (IPCC1)

(2) The main argument for linking extreme weather with climate change comes from climate projections, which are completely omitted here. The IPCC special report on the 1.5 degree target2 is very clear in stating that a global warming of 2 degrees will lead to more extreme events than global warming of 1.5 degrees: “Climate models project robust differences in regional climate between present-day and global warming up to 1.5°C, and between 1.5°C and 2°C (high confidence), depending on the variable and region in question (high confidence). Large, robust and widespread differences are expected for temperature extremes (high confidence).” and “Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would limit risks of increases in heavy precipitation events on a global scale and in several regions compared to conditions at 2°C global warming (medium confidence). ” These are only summary statements, but detailed elaboration is given within the report.

1 – IPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis
2 – IPCC (2018) Global Warming of 1.5 °C","Tropical cyclones are extreme and rare events thus statistically significant changes are difficult to detect especially given the limitations in historical observations before satellite coverage, but overall coastal flooding is becoming much more of a problem under global warming as sea levels rise. This will only get worse in the future.",,,"Some regions experience more, some less and some no trend. Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another.","Confidence is often low due to the limited data availability. As also stated by the IPCC, low confidence does not necessarily imply that a link does not exist.",,,,"There’s no trend in global droughts. Cold snaps in the U.S. are down but, unexpectedly, so are heatwaves.","Yes, but not in other regions of the world (see annotations above).",The temperature claims are a bit misleading. We experience more and more record breaking warm temperatures over time due to global warming. These changes are damaging for many reasons beyond drought.,,,The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather,"As stated in my comments above, this conclusion is not valid. It is based on incomplete reasoning. The argumentation in the article confuses the occurrence of events with their cost, neglects observational evidence from other regions than the US, and completely omits insight from climate projections. The fact that it is still difficult/impossible to attribute individual extreme events to climate change in the observational record makes it easy to say that the link between global warming and increasing extreme events does not exist. But projections are very clear, and the fact that we cannot detect the links in all observations YET does not mean that it will not emerge when the warming signal increases. See also e.g. Suarez-Gutierrez et al1 for a discussion of the role of internal natural variability in distinguishing between different warming regimes.

"Claim that human civilization could end in 30 years is speculative, not supported with evidence",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/iflscience-story-on-speculative-report-provides-little-scientific-context-james-felton/,"High Likelihood Of Human Civilization Coming To An End"" Within 30 Years",https://www.iflscience.com/environment/new-report-warns-high-likelihood-of-human-civilization-coming-to-an-end-within-30-years/,"A harrowing scenario analysis of how human civilization might collapse in coming decades due to climate change has been endorsed by a former Australian defense chief and senior royal navy commander.

The analysis, published by the Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration, a think-tank in Melbourne, Australia, describes climate change as “a near- to mid-term existential threat to human civilization” and sets out a plausible scenario of where business-as-usual could lead over the next 30 years.

The paper argues that the potentially “extremely serious outcomes” of climate-related security threats are often far more probable than conventionally assumed, but almost impossible to quantify because they “fall outside the human experience of the last thousand years.”

On our current trajectory, the report warns, “planetary and human systems [are] reaching a ‘point of no return’ by mid-century, in which the prospect of a largely uninhabitable Earth leads to the breakdown of nations and the international order.”

The only way to avoid the risks of this scenario is what the report describes as “akin in scale to the World War II emergency mobilization”—but this time focused on rapidly building out a zero-emissions industrial system to set in train the restoration of a safe climate.

The scenario warns that our current trajectory will likely lock in at least 3 degrees Celsius (C) of global heating, which in turn could trigger further amplifying feedbacks unleashing further warming. This would drive the accelerating collapse of key ecosystems “including coral reef systems, the Amazon rainforest and in the Arctic.”

The results would be devastating. Some one billion people would be forced to attempt to relocate from unlivable conditions, and two billion would face scarcity of water supplies. Agriculture would collapse in the sub-tropics, and food production would suffer dramatically worldwide. The internal cohesion of nation-states like the US and China would unravel.

“Even for 2°C of warming, more than a billion people may need to be relocated and in high-end scenarios, the scale of destruction is beyond our capacity to model with a high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end,” the report notes.

The new policy briefing is written by David Spratt, Breakthrough’s research director and Ian Dunlop, a former senior executive of Royal Dutch Shell who previously chaired the Australian Coal Association.

In the briefing’s foreword, retired Admiral Chris Barrie—Chief of the Australian Defence Force from 1998 to 2002 and former Deputy Chief of the Australian Navy—commends the paper for laying “bare the unvarnished truth about the desperate situation humans, and our planet, are in, painting a disturbing picture of the real possibility that human life on Earth may be on the way to extinction, in the most horrible way.”

Barrie now works for the Climate Change Institute at Australian National University, Canberra.

Spratt told Motherboard that a key reason the risks are not understood is that “much knowledge produced for policymakers is too conservative. Because the risks are now existential, a new approach to climate and security risk assessment is required using scenario analysis.”

Last October, Motherboard reported on scientific evidence that the UN’s summary report for government policymakers on climate change—whose findings were widely recognized as “devastating”—were in fact too optimistic.

While the Breakthrough scenario sets out some of the more ‘high end’ risk possibilities, it is often not possible to meaningfully quantify their probabilities. As a result, the authors emphasize that conventional risk approaches tend to downplay worst-case scenarios despite their plausibility.

Spratt and Dunlop’s 2050 scenario illustrates how easy it could be to end up in an accelerating runaway climate scenario which would lead to a largely uninhabitable planet within just a few decades.

“A high-end 2050 scenario finds a world in social breakdown and outright chaos,” said Spratt. “But a short window of opportunity exists for an emergency, global mobilization of resources, in which the logistical and planning experiences of the national security sector could play a valuable role.”",low,"Alarmist, Misleading",1084,"This article at IFLScience describes a report produced by an Australian think tank. The report attempts to describe a possible worst case climate scenario in 2050. The report claims this scenario leads to a “high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end”, but does not support this claim with evidence.

Scientists who reviewed IFLScience’s story found that it failed to provide sufficient context for this report—differentiating, for example, between speculative claims and descriptions of peer-reviewed research. In particular, the story’s headline (“New Report Warns ‘High Likelihood Of Human Civilization Coming To An End’ Within 30 Years”) misrepresents the report as a likely projection rather than an exploration of an intrinsically unlikely worst case scenario.",,,,,"Amber Kerr, Researcher, Agricultural Sustainability Institute, University of California, Davis:","The content of the IFLScience article is mostly an accurate representation of the contents of the Breakthrough report, but the article tends to gloss over important caveats and probabilities that are given in the report. The least accurate part of the IFLScience article is the headline, which is an outright misrepresentation of the report. The article title states that there is, overall, a “high probability” of human civilization coming to an end in 30 years. This is extremely misleading. What the Breakthrough report actually says is that, in the most unlikely, “long-tail” biophysical scenario where climate feedbacks are much more severe than we expect, THEN there is a high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end. But the report authors explicitly state that this “high-end scenario” is beyond their capacity to model or to quantitatively estimate.","Daniel Swain, Climate Scientist, University of California, Los Angeles:","The article uncritically reproduces claims from a recent report released by an Australian thinktank regarding the purported “end of human civilization” due to climate change over the next 30 years. While there is plenty of scientific evidence that climate change will pose increasingly existential threats to the most vulnerable individuals in society and to key global ecosystems, even these dire outcomes aren’t equivalent to the “annihilation of intelligent life,” as is claimed in the report.","Andrew King, Research fellow, University of Melbourne:","The report this article is based on describes a scenario which is unlikely, but several aspects of what is included in the report are likely to worsen in coming decades, such as the occurrence of deadly heatwaves. The conclusion of a high likelihood that human civilisation will end is false, although there is a great deal of evidence that there will be many damaging consequences to continued global warming over the coming decades.","Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory:","I don’t think it’s so easy to discount the essential warning of this report. However, it would have been stronger if the authors were more careful not to mention the unsupported concept of near-term human extinction, and the unsupported probabilistic claim that there is a “high likelihood” of their 2050 scenario which includes the collapse of civilization. I do not understand why non-scientist writers (neither report author is a scientist) feel a need to exaggerate sound scientific findings, when those findings are already quite alarming enough. I feel that humanity should undertake urgent climate action just as the report authors do, but I feel that misrepresenting the science is unhelpful and unnecessary.","Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of Exeter:","This is a classic case of a media article over-stating the conclusions and significance of a non-peer reviewed report that itself had already overstated (and indeed misrepresented) peer-reviewed science – some of which was already somewhat controversial.

The way it is written here (and in the report) is misleading because it gives the impression that everyone dies in those conditions. That is not actually how Mora et al define “deadly heat” – they merely looked for heatwaves when somebody died (not everybody) and then used that as the definition of a “deadly” heatwave.,,,,"North America suffers extreme weather events including wildfires, drought, and heatwaves.

It should be clarified that “deadly heat” here means heat and humidity beyond a two-dimension threshold where at least one person in the region subject to that heat and humidity dies (i.e., not everyone instantly dies). That said, in my opinion, the projections in Mora et al are conservative and the methods of Mora et al are sound. I did not check the claims in this report against Mora et al but I have no reason to think they are in error.

Emissions ARE accelerating exponentially, leading to exponential CO2 atmospheric fraction increase, but exponential growth in CO2 fraction leads to linearly increasing global mean temperature.
",,,,By 2050 there’s a scientific consensus that we reached the tipping point for ice sheets in Greenland and the West Antarctic well before 2°C (3.6°F) of warming,"This is somewhat unclear phrasing from the report. Although studies have shown it is possible that the threshold for the Greenland Ice Sheet tipping point may be lower than 2C global warming (relative to pre-industrial), there is not currently a scientific consensus that this is where the threshold is. It seems to authors’ scenario is that scientists living in 2050 have reached the consensus that the tipping point has been passed by that time, but that’s different – again it’s part of the scenario and does not support the “end of civilisation by 2050” headline.

Commentary in The Australian by Ian Plimer relies on false claims to make its case,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-australian-commentary-by-ian-plimer-relies-on-false-claims-to-make-its-case/,The truth of climate change is revealed at school,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/the-truth-of-climate-change-is-revealed-at-school/news-story/31d9ab27de3ec577217a590476bf16c1,"Bill Shorten and his allies, the Greens economic vandals, believe climate change is a moral issue. So is telling the truth.

With his elite private school education, the Oppo­s­i­tion Leader would have learned about the Roman Warming, the Dark Ages, the Medieval Warming and the Little Ice Age. These took place before industrialisation and were all driven by changes in the sun. He would have learned that ­natural warm times, like now, bring great prosperity, increased longevity and less disease, whereas Jack Frost brings death, depopulation and economic stresses.

In biology, the Labor leader would have learned of Darwinism and environmental adapta­tion of species. Humans live on ice and in the hills, valleys, tropics and des­erts, at altitude and on coastal plains. Like countless other organ­isms, we move and adapt when the environment changes. Species thrive when it is warm.

From his education at a relig­ious school, he would have learned about the apostle Thomas. One of the strengths of our Western civilisation is doubt and scepticism. Surely Shorten does not believe the catastrophism promoted by green activists and self-interested alleged experts at the expense of the nation. If he does, he is unelectable.

If he is knowingly promoting a falsehood, he is unelectable. Critical thinking was fundamental to our culture and should be embraced in policy formulation. In school science, Shorten would have learned carbon dioxide is the food of life and without this natural gas, which occurs in space and all planets, there would be no life.

He also would understand from his maths lessons that when 3 per cent of total annual global emissions of carbon dioxide are from humans and Australia prod­uces 1.3 per cent of this 3 per cent, then no amount of emissions reductio­n here will have any effect on global climate.

A quick search would show him that whenever in the past there was an explosion of plant life, the carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present. If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, all life dies.

Shorten should know that for thousands of millions of years the Earth has been changing, with cycles­ and one-off events such as an asteroid impact, super-volcano or a supernova explosion.

He should know that climate always changes and that the planet would be in serious trouble if it did not. There are cycles of air, water, rocks and continents. There are measurable cycles with the sun, Earth’s orbit, oceans and moon that drive climate change, especially if cycles coincide. It has yet to be demonstrated that the climate change today is any different from those of the past.

Despite hundreds of billions of dollars of expenditure during the past few decades, it still has not been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive ­global warming. Yet wind and solar industrial complexes pepper the landscape allegedly to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

They run on subsidies, not the wind or the sun. Wind and solar are transfering money from the poor to the rich, not saving the environment. These subsidies, paid by the long-suffering consumer and employer, add to emissions because coal-fired elec­tricity needs to be on standby for when there is no wind or sunshine.

The amount of energy used to construct solar and wind facilities is greater than they produce in their working lives. The amount of carbon dioxide released during construction and maintenance is far more than is saved. Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.

Union superannuation funds have invested massively in renewable energy. Labor’s promise of 50 per cent renewables will cost electricity consumers hundreds of billions but will benefit the unions.

As soon as renewables were introduced into the grid, electric­ity prices increased and delivery became unreliable. Increased elec­tric­ity costs have created unemployment, and many pensioners and the poor cannot afford electricity. An increase in renewables will make matters worse.

Does Shorten’s energy policy consider those who lose jobs and have the power cut off in his race to achieve 50 per cent renewables to fill the pockets of Labor union mates? And what about the scams siphoning off tens of billions that slosh around the world as carbon credits, carbon trading and renewable energy certificates? Rather than take this money from the poor via higher electricity prices, it would be better spent at home.

To smugly claim that valid questions about energy costs are dumb or deceitful is a loud warning bell. Shorten refuses to tell us how he will spend our money or to give any detail on energy ­systems that are proven failures. It is our money and, if he will not give us the financial details, we should be very scared of his shiftiness. I have never written a blank cheque for a used car.

Climate Feedback:
To learn more about the little ice age, read our review of one of the many articles wrongly predicting an imminent cooling. Professor Michael Lockwood explains: “The term “mini ice age” is inherently misleading in the context of solar variations as it implies a global decrease in temperatures and at all times of year. This does not apply at all to the solar Maunder minimum. Temperature observations from central England show that summers during the Maunder minimum were, if anything, slightly warmer than average[…] there was increased occurrence of cold winters during the Maunder minimum but this is an effect of jet stream behaviour specific to northern Europe and the USA and not a global ice age.”",,,,"natural warm times, like now, bring great prosperity, increased longevity and less disease, whereas Jack Frost brings death, depopulation and economic stresses.","This is a common misconception. We are not talking about minor climate fluctuations, we are experiencing a major, abrupt climate change. Because current climate change is so fast, ecosystems are at risk, infrastructure is at risk, and the result will certainly not bring great prosperity. Climate change related health impacts are also on the rise, so there will certainly not be “less disease”",,,,"Like countless other organ­isms, we move and adapt when the environment changes. Species thrive when it is warm.","The rate of change is important. CO2 concentrations and temperatures are changing at an unprecedented rate, which will make it impossible for many organisms to “move and adapt”.",,,,"carbon dioxide is the food of life and without this natural gas, which occurs in space and all planets, there would be no life.","The same goes for water, it is natural and necessary for life, you can still drown in a flood.

Too much and too little carbon dioxide and water is bad for you. The proposal is to stop messing with our climate system by changing the CO2 from the level it had when human civilization was built.",,,,"when 3 per cent of total annual global emissions of carbon dioxide are from humans and Australia prod­uces 1.3 per cent of this 3 per cent, then no amount of emissions reductio­n here will have any effect on global climate.","This is enormously misleading; humans are entirely responsible for the rapid increase in the greenhouse gas concentrations within the atmosphere over the last 150 years, primarily through the burning of fossil fuels.","The natural emissions are balanced by natural sinks (comparable to our bank accounts, salary comes in, rent or mortgage goes out, grocery bills go out, the incoming and outgoing fluxes are high, but at the end of the month we end up with more or less the same amount of money we started with). Human emissions are on top of this fine natural balance. Humans add CO2 but they don’t remove CO2. And while this would be great news for our bank accounts, it’s not great news for our planet.","Human CO2 emissions are two times larger than the increase of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. The oceans and vegetation fortunately have taken up the other half1-2.

Humans are fully responsible for the atmospheric CO2 increase.

We can only fight climate change if everyone does their part. Australia doing more makes other countries willing to do more.

CO2 is a greenhouse gas and human emissions are increasing its concentration. Human emissions therefore drive global warming1. This can be measured, it can be explained theoretically and it can be seen in the past evolution of temperatures and CO2.

We have known for over 100 years that CO2 is a greenhouse gas; without CO2 in the atmosphere, Earth’s surface would be tens of degrees colder, and probably not habitable for life. Increasing the CO2 concentration enhances the greenhouse effect, warming the Earth’s surface; this enhancement of the greenhouse effect has been observed by satellites. Furthermore, differences in the concentration of CO2 are known to be important for climate change that has occurred in Earth’s distant past, from hundreds of thousands to millions of years ago.","This is so trivially wrong and such old well-established science, that I hope a Wikipedia link is allowed.",,[subsidies for wind and solar] add to emissions because coal-fired elec­tricity needs to be on standby for when there is no wind or sunshine.,"Baseless and, in regions where this has been studied, false.

For example, in Illinois1. And this ignores more efficient ways of reducing backup emissions, such as energy storage like batteries.

1- Valentino et al (2012) System-Wide Emissions Implications of Increased Wind Power Penetration, Environmental Science & Technology",,,,The amount of energy used to construct solar and wind facilities is greater than they produce in their working lives.,"This is false.

The average working wind farm that has been studied produces about 20 times more energy than was used to make them1. Some wind farms are better, some are worse. Solar, too, produces more energy than was used to make the solar farm.

1- Kubiszewski et al (2010) Meta-analysis of net energy return for wind power systems, Renewable Energy","Numbers for “Energy Return on Investment” (EROI) are all over the place, but a nice summary with references to supporting information was produced for Scientific American by Mason Inman for the April 2013 edition of Scientific American. Mason estimated that wind returns about 20 times the energy input and solar around 6 times their energy input. While these numbers do depend on a range of assumptions, the idea that these ratios are less than one is wrong and not defensible.

The construction of wind turbines and solar panels does result in some carbon dioxide emission but far less than would be emitted were that electricity generated using fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or oil. Therefore, if the alternative is fossil fuels, these technologies help avoid carbon dioxide emissions.

It should be noted that Energy Return on Investment is likely to increase over time as the economy becomes more efficient and thus economic inputs to the production of energy technologies becomes less energy intensive.","The energy input to a wind farm is generated in 3 to 6 months of its operation, depending on location, and the energy input to a solar farm is generated in 1 to 3 years of its operation, depending on location and type of solar panel used. Both wind and solar farms have expected lifetimes of about 25 years.

Increased elec­tric­ity costs have created unemployment, and many pensioners and the poor cannot afford electricity. An increase in renewables will make matters worse.”","Today, variable renewable energy sources do present challenges to electricity grid management and do result in price volatility. If reliable electricity is the goal, given the high cost of electricity storage and the lack of continental scale electricity grids, deep penetration of intermittent renewables does increase system costs, narrowly defined.

However, it is important to bear in mind that fossil fuels impose a huge cost on the environment that is not monetized and reflected in electricity prices to the consumer. If the full cost, including environmental costs, of fossil fuel energy were passed on to the consumer, on most analyses expanded renewable energy would be a net cost saver. Fossil fuels have been getting a free ride by imposing costs to current and future generations around the world.

Different jurisdictions adjust electricity costs in different ways. The Australian market, like the market in Texas, is notable for market structures with high price volatility. Other markets put more emphasis on maintaining capacity to deal with spikes in demand or crevasses in renewable energy generation. This tends to spread costs out over time and allow businesses to better plan the electricity costs, but there is an added cost to building the extra generation capacity. There is no free lunch. Low cost of fossil fuel electricity generation comes at the cost of imposing climate change throughout the world and for many generations to come. Avoiding imposing these costs on others means imposing a little more cost on people using electricity. The goal of clean energy research and development is to make this “little more cost” as little as possible, and perhaps even eliminate the cost differential entirely.",,,,"Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.","There is no comparison here with the alternatives.

Breitbart article baselessly claims a study of past climate invalidates human-caused climate change,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-article-baselessly-claims-a-study-of-past-climate-invalidates-human-caused-climate-change-john-nolte/,Scientists Prove Man-Made Global Warming Is a Hoax,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/04/09/nolte-scientists-prove-man-made-global-warming-is-a-hoax/,"The far-left ThinkProgress reports that scientists have finally proven that the theory of man-made Global Warming is a total hoax.

Of course, no one will admit it, but that is exactly what has happened.

A new scientific study shows has revealed the following:

Current CO2 levels of 410 parts per million (ppm) were last seen on Earth three million years ago, according to the most detailed reconstruction of the Earth’s climate by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and published in Science Advances.

Yes, you read that correctly, three million — million — years ago CO2 levels on Earth were the same as they are today, but there is one major difference between three million years ago and today…

Three million years ago, we humans were not driving cars or eating the meat that requires cow farts; we weren’t barbecuing or refusing to recycle or building factories; there was no Industrial Age, no plastic, no air conditioning, no electricity, no lumber mills, no consumerism, no aerosols.

In fact, three million years ago, there were probably no human beings on Earth, at least not human in the way we use that term today. And yet…

CO2 levels were the same then as they are now…

Hmmm…?

But I thought humans warmed the planet? That’s the hustle we’ve been sold for three decades now — you know, that WE are the problem.

We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit. Oh, no, that could never be it — so stop saying that could be, you Denier.

Well, what about the Ice Age that occurred thousands and thousands of years before the Industrial Age.

Shut up, Denier.

And yet…

According to the study, scientists also discovered that during this period of Global Warming “there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.”

How is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer?

It gets worse:

Temperatures were up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer globally, at least double that at the poles, and sea levels were some 20 meters (65 feet) higher.

How is that possible 2,999,945 years before Americans moved to the suburbs and lit up the charcoal grills?

Naturally, even in the face of a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man-made Global Warming, ThinkProgress is sticking with that hoax but is also forced to concede the following:

The good news is that the Earth does not warm instantly, and mile-thick ice sheets melt even more slowly. So the temperature rise will take several decades, and tens of feet of sea level rise will take hundreds and hundreds of years.

But-but-but-but Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy told me we only have 12 years!

And then ThinkProgress drops this anti-science stink bomb:

That means the choices we make now can affect the rate of rise and determine whether we blow past 65 feet of sea level rise to beyond 200 feet.

Because, because, because Orange Man Bad:

Even worse, the climate policy agenda President Donald Trump is pushing — actions that include rolling back U.S. laws that reduce carbon pollution and abandoning the Paris climate agreement — would lock us in to such high CO2 levels, sea levels would rise a foot per decade in just a few decades.

No, actually, what this study proves is that there is nothing we can do to stop  the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles. Even the worst of the worst, even the most maniacal pushing the Global Warming Hoax admit that, at best, we can only cool the planet a couple of degrees, which will do next to nothing if the planet is determined to again warm itself by seven degrees, as we now know it did 2,999,998 years before the Bad Orange Man approved a couple of pipelines.",very_low,"Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",1677,"This Breitbart article comments on a story by ThinkProgress about a study related to past climate, mistakenly concluding that it invalidates the science that shows human activities are currently altering the climate of our planet.

Scientists who reviewed the article explain that it builds on a fallacious reasoning, as if the fact that climate has changed due to natural forcing in the past would make it impossible for human emissions of CO2 to change it now. In reality, the climate of the Earth can be influenced by various forcings, including changes in the Sun’s irradiance and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, which in turn can be due to natural causes (as has been the case in the past) or activities related to human actions—as is the case currently.

All the scientists indicated that the content of the article does not support the claim made by the headline.

In addition to Breitbart, a number of other outlets published stories repeating the mistaken claim that this scientific study would disprove the human origin of climate change, including: Climate Change Dispatch, Godfather Politics, Technocracy.","As the lead author of the paper published in Science Advances on which this article is based on, I would like to state that it is a misrepresentation of the findings published in Willeit et al (2019)*. Our paper does not in any way disprove the human origin of current climate change. On the contrary, our model, which is able to reproduce the last 3 million years of natural climate variability, clearly shows that the rise of atmospheric CO2 concentration since the industrial revolution can not be explained by natural climate processes.

We are certain that humans are responsible for the current rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, because the amount being emitted is more than enough to explain the amount building up in the atmosphere. Climate scientists are well aware that there are also natural changes in the carbon cycle that have led to higher CO2 concentrations in the past, and in fact this gives more of a cause for concern rather than less, because it shows that a warming climate can cause natural carbon sinks to weaken and therefore further accelerate the rise in CO2.","Mark Richardson, Research Associate, Colorado State University/NASA JPL","The new research shows that a past high CO2 period had lots of global warming, just like we expect from today’s human-driven CO2 changes. Breitbart’s argument is that since CO2 changed naturally before, we can’t change it now. This is like saying that fires happened naturally before so there is no way any of us could cause a fire.

Although not a new result (see Martinez-Boti et al 20151), the linked study by Willeit et al2 has new model simulations looking how climate changed from the Pliocene to the Pleistocene, and demonstrates how declining CO2 levels lead to a change in the climate system. However what follows is largely a misunderstanding of the implications.

2- Willeit et al (2019) Mid-Pleistocene transition in glacial cycles explained by declining CO2 and regolith removal, Science Advances","The author writes this as if this is something that is a surprise. We all know that the Earth’s CO2 levels were higher at various times in the past. In the Eocene, 50 million years ago, they may have even been four times as high. This is not an issue. In the past, rates of volcanic CO2 emissions globally were higher as continental spreading rates changed, for example. Saying that CO2 isn’t rising now due to humans just because it used to be high in the past is like saying “I didn’t chop the cherry tree down because 40 years ago there was never a cherry tree there”. It is totally unrelated.",,,CO2 levels were the same then as they are now,"Yes, naturally CO2 were as high in the Pliocene 3 million years ago as they are today. We have good records of the past 66 Million years of CO2-driven climate change, and these record a broad decline over that time, with the Pliocene the last time CO2 was naturally as high as it is today following anthropogenic emissions.",,,,We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit.,"This confounds natural variations in CO2 in the geological past with human-caused emissions today. Yes, CO2 has changed naturally over time, causing changes to climate, but the high levels and rapid increase we are seeing today is because of human-caused emissions.","This entire article’s “proof” is just saying that “higher CO2 happened before humans, therefore humans can’t cause higher CO2“.

Here are logically identical arguments: “England scored goals before Harry Kane, so Harry Kane can’t score goals” Or in American English: “The New England Patriots scored touchdowns before Rob Gronkowski, so Rob Gronkowski can’t score touchdowns” Or more simply: “Fires happened before humans, so humans can’t cause fires”.

So if you agree with this article’s logic and that humans aren’t causing CO2 to rise, you also have to believe that Harry Kane and Rob Gronkowski never scored anything and could never score anything, and that no fire has been caused by a human ever.

Human-caused global warming, goals by Harry Kane, touchdowns by Rob Gronkowski, and fires set by people are all in the same boat. We have enormous evidence that they exist.","We are well aware that there are climatic fluctuations through geological time. Huge numbers of scientists study how the Earth’s climate has fluctuated before, and we know what caused those changes. Current warming is not related to any natural climate cycle, or process, or astronomic phenomenon.",,"According to the study, scientists also discovered that during this period of Global Warming “there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.”","This is where the real logical fallacy of this article becomes clear. Indeed, when CO2 was naturally as high as we have caused it to be now, the world was much warmer than today because of the naturally higher CO2. It therefore follows that the high CO2 levels we have created in the atmosphere will lead to a warmer world, just like the Pliocene.",,,,"“there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.” How is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer?","What this study tells us is that the last time CO2 was as high as 410 ppm (back then through natural causes), there was no ice on Greenland or West Antarctica. What this means is that we can potentially expect (once the climate has equilibrated to its new CO2 levels) that these ice bodies will melt in the future from anthropogenic CO2 release. If this happens, the sea level will rise by metres, and many coastal and lowland cities will be affected.

In a way I have to profess my admiration- how a news outlet could take a paper presenting evidence that we should be very worried about CO2 being 410 ppm, and turns it into a paper that “debunks climate change”, is beyond me. It really is a feat that must have taken a lot of imagination and creative thinking.",,,,"How is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer?","Because the amount of CO2 naturally present in the atmosphere depends on how much is being released or taken up by the oceans, land ecosystems, and chemical reactions involved in rock weathering. These change naturally, but gradually, over thousands or millions of years. Human emissions of CO2 are merely adding an extra factor to the equation, but it is one which has a big effect over much short timescales (the last few decades).","It is possible because CO2 sources (e.g. volcanic degassing) and CO2 sinks (e.g. from chemical weathering of the Earth’s surface) were differently balanced back then.

In this report, the year 2030—12 years from now—is given as the “point of no return”, if we keep releasing CO2 at our current rate. What this means is that after this point, it is almost impossible to imagine how CO2 in the atmosphere could ever be brought back down to levels needed to keep global temperatures less than 1.5 ˚C warmer. This figure comes from the IPCC report scientists—hundreds of scientists from different fields working all around the world.

The article has taken this figure out of context, and is comparing it to something very different. What ThinkProgress says is related to the timescales it takes for the maximum effects of the CO2 released now to take hold. This is not in conflict with the IPCC figure of 12 years cited by AOC—this report talks about the year we must stop releasing CO2 by in order for the long term knock on effects of this CO2 release to not be so detrimental to humankind.","This confuses the time left to start seriously cutting emissions, with the long tail of impacts that those emissions have.

Its topic wasn’t even related to showing climate cycles—the subject of the paper is looking at the effect on CO2 of ice sheets scraping soil and weathered rock off the Earth’s surface over ice ages.

CO2 rise and warming that is happening now is entirely something that we have caused (see here for some helpful pointers). We can control our CO2 release, and so we can control our current rate of warming.

Western Journal op-ed deceives readers with completely unsupported claims,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/western-journal-op-ed-deceives-readers-with-completely-unsupported-claims-jay-lehr-tom-harris/,Media Hysteria: Climate Change ‘Heat Records’ Are a Huge Data Manipulation,https://www.westernjournal.com/media-hysteria-climate-change-heat-records-huge-data-manipulation/,"The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate.

Americans receive a daily barrage from the fake news media and climate “experts” reporting that each and every day, week, month or year is the hottest on record due to global warming. On Feb. 7, several major newspapers carried stories of the declaration by NASA and NOAA that the past five years have been the warmest on record. Sadly, these supposed experts use mathematical equations that do not jive with reality over the past 140 years.

The same climate experts warn that record heat is just the tip of the iceberg. We are constantly told that global warming is the root cause behind any and all weather events that are extreme, destructive, unusual or uncomfortable. Many of these fear mongers also say we should stop burning fossil fuels that are causing this mayhem.

Is the Earth truly experiencing the hottest weather on record? Absolutely not.

After examining actual weather records over the past 100 years, there is no correlation between rising carbon dioxide levels and local temperatures.

However, climate change alarmists always find somewhere on Earth where temperatures are hotter than ever. The focus is always on isolated temperatures that have reached all-time highs while ignoring reports of all-time record lows. These zealots would like you to believe that due to fossil fuel emissions, summers are now longer and hotter while winters are shorter and milder.

Yet, the actual temperature records tell a very different story. Did the Earth experience its hottest temperature ever this year? The answer is no. The highest record temperature ever reported was 136 degrees Fahrenheit in Libya in 1922. The record high temperature for the United States was 134 degrees Fahrenheit in Death Valley, California in 1913. Fossil fuel emissions in 1913 and 1922 were negligible compared to today.

The coldest temperature ever reported was minus 129 degrees Fahrenheit in Vostok, Antarctica, in 1983 when Carbon dioxide emissions were five times higher than in 1913. The coldest temperature in the lower 48 states (excluding Alaska) of minus 64 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded in 1996 in Embarrass, Minnesota. Did the media and climate scientists warn that this low temperature indicated that we are headed for another Ice Age?

The maximum reported difference between high and low temperatures at a single location is 188 degrees Fahrenheit (from minus 90F to plus 98F) in Verhoyansk, Siberia. In fact, record changes of highs and lows have occurred in 22 U.S. cities on a single day. For example, in 1989 the temperature in Alamosa, Colorado, varied between a low of 35F and a high of 91F for a temperature swing of 56 degrees F.

We hope these examples, right out of the weather record books, compiled by C.C. Burt in his book Extreme Weather Changes, will help you to understand the scams alarmists are trying to pull. These examples all illustrate that cherry-picking record high temperatures in isolated locations tells absolutely nothing about the Earth’s climate.

The strongest heat wave ever recorded occurred in July 1936, generating high temperatures in half of America’s 50 states. In 1935, fossil fuel emissions were 25 times lower than today. America’s coldest year occurred in 1899, when temperatures dropped below 0 F in all 50 states.

Interesting that the figure above shows the most severe historic cold wave during the past century took place in 1936, which was the same year when the strongest heat wave took place. In terms of general behavior, the global warming alarmist prediction is that as time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase, the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease. However, these trends do not exist and the data dispels, rather than supports, the global warming hypothesis.

Concurrently a compilation of all days since 1915 when temperatures exceeded 90F shows them decreasing with time rather than increasing in Figure 2.

The heat waves experienced in the 1930s and 1950s are clearly evident here. Once again, the data does not support the claim that the United States is hotter than ever as a result of rising Carbon dioxide levels.

From 1970 until 1998 there was a warming period that raised temperatures by about 0.7 F that helped spawn the global warming alarmist movement. However, since 1998, little warming has occurred while carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase. This is totally consistent with variations in the amount of heat the Earth receives from the Sun.

These facts are completely supported by 4,000 ocean floats which measure ocean temperatures at a variety of depths. This data at argo.ucsd.edu measures the oceans where climate-induced temperatures occur.

Isn’t it time to start ignoring the calamitous annual claims that this is the hottest year on record? It just ain’t so.

The increase of heat waves is one of the many consequences of this.

The article confusingly uses the term “record” in two meanings. The term records can be used for the observations that were recorded by meteorologists over the last centuries. The term “records” is mostly used for the highest or lowest value ever seen. In an article about the highest and lowest temperatures, it is best to avoid using the term records for the recorded data.

The article also confusingly keeps on jumping between claims about local records in daily mean temperatures and claims about the long-term global mean temperature. Local temperatures are by their nature more variable than global average temperatures, daily temperatures are by their nature more variable than long-term average temperatures, records are by their nature more random than averages.

With all the extra variability in the local daily records the authors can easily cherry pick a few data points that fit their narrative. What would make their case stronger would be if they actually analysed all the data, engaged with the existing scientific literature and made their own contribution to our scientific understanding by publishing a scientific paper.

New York Times’ coverage of IPCC report clearly presents conclusions,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-coverage-of-ipcc-report-clearly-presents-conclusions-coral-davenport/,Major Climate Report Describes a Strong Risk of Crisis as Early as 2040,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html,"INCHEON, South Korea — A landmark report from the United Nations’ scientific panel on climate change paints a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought and says that avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has “no documented historic precedent.”

The report, issued on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders, describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040 — a period well within the lifetime of much of the global population.

The report “is quite a shock, and quite concerning,” said Bill Hare, an author of previous I.P.C.C. reports and a physicist with Climate Analytics, a nonprofit organization. “We were not aware of this just a few years ago.” The report was the first to be commissioned by world leaders under the Paris agreement, the 2015 pact by nations to fight global warming.

The authors found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the atmosphere will warm up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2040, inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty. Previous work had focused on estimating the damage if average temperatures were to rise by a larger number, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius), because that was the threshold scientists previously considered for the most severe effects of climate change.

The new report, however, shows that many of those effects will come much sooner, at the 2.7-degree mark.

Avoiding the most serious damage requires transforming the world economy within just a few years, said the authors, who estimate that the damage would come at a cost of $54 trillion. But while they conclude that it is technically possible to achieve the rapid changes required to avoid 2.7 degrees of warming, they concede that it may be politically unlikely.

For instance, the report says that heavy taxes or prices on carbon dioxide emissions — perhaps as high as $27,000 per ton by 2100 — would be required. But such a move would be almost politically impossible in the United States, the world’s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China. Lawmakers around the world, including in China, the European Union and California, have enacted carbon pricing programs.

President Trump, who has mocked the science of human-caused climate change, has vowed to increase the burning of coal and said he intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement. And on Sunday in Brazil, the world’s seventh-largest emitter of greenhouse gas, voters appeared on track to elect a new president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has said he also plans to withdraw from the accord.

The report was written and edited by 91 scientists from 40 countries who analyzed more than 6,000 scientific studies. The Paris agreement set out to prevent warming of more than 3.6 degrees above preindustrial levels — long considered a threshold for the most severe social and economic damage from climate change. But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.

Absent aggressive action, many effects once expected only several decades in the future will arrive by 2040, and at the lower temperature, the report shows. “It’s telling us we need to reverse emissions trends and turn the world economy on a dime,” said Myles Allen, an Oxford University climate scientist and an author of the report.

To prevent 2.7 degrees of warming, the report said, greenhouse pollution must be reduced by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, and 100 percent by 2050. It also found that, by 2050, use of coal as an electricity source would have to drop from nearly 40 percent today to between 1 and 7 percent. Renewable energy such as wind and solar, which make up about 20 percent of the electricity mix today, would have to increase to as much as 67 percent.

“This report makes it clear: There is no way to mitigate climate change without getting rid of coal,” said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University and an author of the report.

The World Coal Association disputed the conclusion that stopping global warming calls for an end of coal use. In a statement, Katie Warrick, its interim chief executive, noted that forecasts from the International Energy Agency, a global analysis organization, “continue to see a role for coal for the foreseeable future.”

Ms. Warrick said her organization intends to campaign for governments to invest in carbon capture technology. Such technology, which is currently too expensive for commercial use, could allow coal to continue to be widely used.

Despite the controversial policy implications, the United States delegation joined more than 180 countries on Saturday in accepting the report’s summary for policymakers, while walking a delicate diplomatic line. A State Department statement said that “acceptance of this report by the panel does not imply endorsement by the United States of the specific findings or underlying contents of the report.”

The State Department delegation faced a conundrum. Refusing to approve the document would place the United States at odds with many nations and show it rejecting established academic science on the world stage. However, the delegation also represents a president who has rejected climate science and climate policy.

“We reiterate that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement at the earliest opportunity absent the identification of terms that are better for the American people,” the statement said.

The report attempts to put a price tag on the effects of climate change. The estimated $54 trillion in damage from 2.7 degrees of warming would grow to $69 trillion if the world continues to warm by 3.6 degrees and beyond, the report found, although it does not specify the length of time represented by those costs.

The report concludes that the world is already more than halfway to the 2.7-degree mark. Human activities have caused warming of about 1.8 degrees since about the 1850s, the beginning of large-scale industrial coal burning, the report found.

The United States is not alone in failing to reduce emissions enough to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The report concluded that the greenhouse gas reduction pledges put forth under the Paris agreement will not be enough to avoid 3.6 degrees of warming.

The report emphasizes the potential role of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. “A price on carbon is central to prompt mitigation,” the report concludes. It estimates that to be effective, such a price would have to range from $135 to $5,500 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, and from $690 to $27,000 per ton by 2100.

By comparison, under the Obama administration, government economists estimated that an appropriate price on carbon would be in the range of $50 per ton. Under the Trump administration, that figure was lowered to about $7 per ton.

Americans for Prosperity, the political advocacy group funded by the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch, has made a point of campaigning against politicians who support a carbon tax.

“Carbon taxes are political poison because they increase gas prices and electric rates,” said Myron Ebell, who heads the energy program at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an industry-funded Washington research organization, and who led the Trump administration’s transition at the Environmental Protection Agency.

The report details the economic damage expected should governments fail to enact policies to reduce emissions. The United States, it said, could lose roughly 1.2 percent of gross domestic product for every 1.8 degrees of warming.

In addition, it said, the United States along with Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam are home to 50 million people who will be exposed to the effects of increased coastal flooding by 2040, if 2.7 degrees of warming occur.

At 3.6 degrees of warming, the report predicts a “disproportionately rapid evacuation” of people from the tropics. “In some parts of the world, national borders will become irrelevant,” said Aromar Revi, director of the Indian Institute for Human Settlements and an author of the report. “You can set up a wall to try to contain 10,000 and 20,000 and one million people, but not 10 million.”

The report also finds that, in the likelihood that governments fail to avert 2.7 degrees of warming, another scenario is possible: The world could overshoot that target, heat up by more than 3.6 degrees, and then through a combination of lowering emissions and deploying carbon capture technology, bring the temperature back down below the 2.7-degree threshold.

In that scenario, some damage would be irreversible, the report found. All coral reefs would die. However, the sea ice that would disappear in the hotter scenario would return once temperatures had cooled off.

“For governments, the idea of overshooting the target but then coming back to it is attractive because then they don’t have to make such rapid changes,” Dr. Shindell said. “But it has a lot of disadvantages.”","high, very_high",,38,"This story in The New York Times covered the October release of the IPCC’s “Global Warming of 1.5 °C” report. The report, which was requested by governments during the 2015 Paris Agreement negotiations, details the impacts of 1.5 °C compared to 2 °C and the emissions cuts required to limit warming to either of those levels.

Scientists who reviewed the story found that it provided an accurate and detailed summary of the report, though some statements about warming being “worse than previously thought” could have used some clarifying context.

This was a very comprehensive article, demonstrating the broad range of risks that climate change poses, the scale of the action needed to mitigate climate impacts, as well as the roadblocks to action on climate change. In general, the article did a good job surveying aspects of a large UN report.

It may be that some impacts will be felt earlier or will be worse than previously estimated—this just wasn’t clearly articulated.

Other statements that I thought could have used greater context or examples from the report include the quote by Bill Hare (below), or the statement that “the new report, however, shows that many of those effects will come much sooner, at the 2.7-degree mark.”",,,,avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has “no documented historic precedent.”,"This is a useful point and comes from The Summary for Policymakers (C2.1) and is with regard to the economic transition needed to limit the world to 1.5 degrees C of warming (with limited or no “overshoot.”)

I couldn’t find where this exact statement came from, but it seems reasonable given that (to quote the report) “[…] achieving emissions reduction targets consistent with the ambitious goal of 1.5°C of global warming under the Paris Agreement will result in the further loss of 70–90% of reef-building corals compared to today[…]” and that “Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate.”

And, regarding food security, “Increasing global temperature poses large risks to food security globally and regionally, especially in low-latitude areas (medium confidence) […], with warming of 2°C projected to result in a greater reduction in global crop yields and global nutrition than warming of 1.5°C (high confidence) […], owing to the combined effects of changes in temperature, precipitation and extreme weather events, as well as increasing CO2 concentrations.”",,,,"But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.","The UN Report frequently demonstrated that the impacts of climate change (around the world, not just for island nations) are less severe and widespread at 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit compared to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

Guardian story on climate impacts of diet gets mixed reviews from scientists,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-story-on-climate-impacts-of-diet-gets-mixed-reviews-from-scientists-damian-carrington/,Avoiding meat and dairy is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce your impact on Earth,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth,"Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet, according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet.

The new research shows that without meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% – an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union and Australia combined – and still feed the world. Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife.

The new analysis shows that while meat and dairy provide just 18% of calories and 37% of protein, it uses the vast majority – 83% – of farmland and produces 60% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions. Other recent research shows 86% of all land mammals are now livestock or humans. The scientists also found that even the very lowest impact meat and dairy products still cause much more environmental harm than the least sustainable vegetable and cereal growing.

The study, published in the journal Science, created a huge dataset based on almost 40,000 farms in 119 countries and covering 40 food products that represent 90% of all that is eaten. It assessed the full impact of these foods, from farm to fork, on land use, climate change emissions, freshwater use and water pollution (eutrophication) and air pollution (acidification).

“A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions.

“Agriculture is a sector that spans all the multitude of environmental problems,” he said. “Really it is animal products that are responsible for so much of this. Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy.”

The analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture. But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark, with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land.

The large variability in environmental impact from different farms does present an opportunity for reducing the harm, Poore said, without needing the global population to become vegan. If the most harmful half of meat and dairy production was replaced by plant-based food, this still delivers about two-thirds of the benefits of getting rid of all meat and dairy production.

Cutting the environmental impact of farming is not easy, Poore warned: “There are over 570m farms all of which need slightly different ways to reduce their impact. It is an [environmental] challenge like no other sector of the economy.” But he said at least $500bn is spent every year on agricultural subsidies, and probably much more: “There is a lot of money there to do something really good with.”

Labels that reveal the impact of products would be a good start, so consumers could choose the least damaging options, he said, but subsidies for sustainable and healthy foods and taxes on meat and dairy will probably also be necessary.

One surprise from the work was the large impact of freshwater fish farming, which provides two-thirds of such fish in Asia and 96% in Europe, and was thought to be relatively environmentally friendly. “You get all these fish depositing excreta and unconsumed feed down to the bottom of the pond, where there is barely any oxygen, making it the perfect environment for methane production,” a potent greenhouse gas, Poore said.

The research also found grass-fed beef, thought to be relatively low impact, was still responsible for much higher impacts than plant-based food. “Converting grass into [meat] is like converting coal to energy. It comes with an immense cost in emissions,” Poore said.

The new research has received strong praise from other food experts. Prof Gidon Eshel, at Bard College, US, said: “I was awestruck. It is really important, sound, ambitious, revealing and beautifully done.”

He said previous work on quantifying farming’s impacts, including his own, had taken a top-down approach using national level data, but the new work used a bottom-up approach, with farm-by-farm data. “It is very reassuring to see they yield essentially the same results. But the new work has very many important details that are profoundly revealing.”

Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds, UK, said: “This is an immensely useful study. It brings together a huge amount of data and that makes its conclusions much more robust. The way we produce food, consume and waste food is unsustainable from a planetary perspective. Given the global obesity crisis, changing diets – eating less livestock produce and more vegetables and fruit – has the potential to make both us and the planet healthier.”

Dr Peter Alexander, at the University of Edinburgh, UK, was also impressed but noted: “There may be environmental benefits, eg for biodiversity, from sustainably managed grazing and increasing animal product consumption may improve nutrition for some of the poorest globally. My personal opinion is we should interpret these results not as the need to become vegan overnight, but rather to moderate our [meat] consumption.”

Poore said: “The reason I started this project was to understand if there were sustainable animal producers out there. But I have stopped consuming animal products over the last four years of this project. These impacts are not necessary to sustain our current way of life. The question is how much can we reduce them and the answer is a lot.”",contrasted,"Imprecise, Unclear",71,"This article in The Guardian covers a study published in Science[1] that investigated environmental impacts related to the production of different types of foods in a number of regions around the world, finding that impacts could vary significantly from one place to another.

Scientists who reviewed the article gave it varied ratings while focusing on different aspects. Some noted that the headline, in particular, makes a more general claim—that “avoiding meat and dairy is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce your impact on Earth”—that isn’t directly supported by this particular study. These general statements relate to quotes from the researchers behind the study and are explained in less detail and with less context than the contents of the study itself, leaving them potentially misleading.

This is part of a series of reviews of 2018’s most popular climate stories on social media.",,,,,"Stefan Wirsenius, Associate Professor, Chalmers University of Technology","The headline of the article is not a fair representation of the research paper, which mainly is about very comprehensive data analysis. But the quote of the lead author supports it. And the article overall gives a balanced and accurate description of the paper.","Margaret Gill, Professor, University of Aberdeen","The scientific publication referred to in the article was comparing the environmental impact of different foods. The article starts with the following “Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet…” This is wrong on two counts relative to the findings reported in the publication: 1) The publication only considered food—the journalist extrapolated to all human activities, and 2) The publication drew attention to heterogeneity both geographically and between different types of meat—the journalist did not make that distinction, again a gross extrapolation.","Martin Heller, Research Specialist, University of Michigan","This article relies heavily on statements made by the authors of the covered journal article that are not necessarily supported in the journal article. The statement “avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet” is not quantified in the journal article, but appears to be an opinion of Joseph Poore.

More importantly, the main figure in this story is presented with the wrong units. The data on greenhouse gas emissions per unit of different food is reported in Poore and Nemeck as emissions per “100g of protein” from each food type, a critical distinction. It is also rather misleading (and confusing) to present the 90th percentile value as a datapoint and use that 90th percentile value as the reference (i.e., the comparison used in the figure title). Poore and Nemeck report means for all of these values: this would be a much more appropriate value to be reporting here.","Hugo Valin, Research Scholar, The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis","The article provides a rigorous description of the Science article on the impact of different food products and the results of different changes in consumption patterns. The strong value added of the Science article is rather in the large dataset collected and the illustration of the heterogeneity in the level of impacts, as the average adverse impacts of food on the environment is documented elsewhere. As described by the article, this heterogeneity also means that becoming vegan is not the only option to have impact on the system. From this point of view, the title of the article is slightly misleading, as some big impacts could also be achieved by consuming products produced more efficiently. However, we illustrated with coauthors in another paper[1] that average EU diet impact on climate was equivalent to driving 6,000 km in a single passenger car. So indeed, for many people, decreasing the diet impact is among their biggest lever of action (after having an extra kid, as provocatively reminded by this peer-review study[2] published in Environmental Research Letters).

[2] Wynes and Nicholas (2017) The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions, Environmental Research Letters","Harry Aiking, Associate Professor, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","The word “Avoiding” in title and text is overly strong and should have been “Reducing”. Adopting a vegan diet is not necessary, but a reduction to having meat 1-2 times a week and dairy 3-4 times a week would suffice. In fact, flexitarian diets utilize natural resources much more efficiently than vegan diets[1]. In the article, Peter Alexander is quoted saying something to the same effect.

The underlying Science paper by Poore & Nemecek is using life cycle assessment. Life cycle assessment is an inherently arbitrary bookkeeping method and potentially misleading. Its caveats take a lifetime to fathom and some can and should be made explicit to lay people. To mention just one example out of many, expressing units per kg live weight, dry weight, or protein (or even cost, using economic allocation) makes a tremendous difference. As an illustration, try to compare cheese and milk. Such cautionary advice is lacking entirely.

Story on congressman’s incorrect claims about sea level rise could have corrected them more explicitly,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/story-on-congressmans-incorrect-claims-about-sea-level-rise-could-have-corrected-them-more-explicitly/,Republican lawmaker: Rocks tumbling into ocean causing sea level rise,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/republican-lawmaker-rocks-tumbling-ocean-causing-sea-level-rise,"The Earth is not warming. The White Cliffs of Dover are tumbling into the sea and causing sea levels to rise. Global warming is helping grow the Antarctic ice sheet.

Those are some of the skeptical assertions echoed by Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Science, Space and Technology Committee yesterday. The lawmakers at times embraced research that questions mainstream climate science during a hearing on how technology can be used to address global warming.

A leading climate scientist testifying before the panel spent much of the two hours correcting misstatements.

The purpose of the hearing was to focus on how technology could be deployed for climate change adaptation. But the hearing frequently turned to the basics of climate science. Many of the questions by Republicans and Democrats alike were directed to Philip Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts and former senior adviser to the U.S. Global Change Research Program.

Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) said he was bothered that established climate science has not been questioned more by the committee, which has accused federal climate scientists of fraudulently manipulating climate data and subpoenaed their records.

""I'm a little bit disturbed by, No. 1, over and over again, I hear, 'Don't ever talk about whether mankind is the main cause of the temperature changing and the climate changing,'"" he said. ""That's a little disturbing to hear constantly beaten into our heads in a Science Committee meeting, when basically we should all be open to different points of view.""

Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), chairman of the committee, entered into the record an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that claimed sea levels are not rising because of climate change, a view that rejects thousands of scientific studies. The piece was written by Fred Singer, who is affiliated with the Heartland Institute in Chicago, Illinois, which promotes the rejection of mainstream climate science.

""To solve climate change challenges, we first need to acknowledge the uncertainties that exist,"" Smith said in his opening remarks. ""Then we can have confidence that innovations and technology will enable us to mitigate any adverse consequences of climate change.""

At one point, Smith showed a slide of two charts that he said demonstrated how the rate of sea-level rise does not equal the sharp spike in the consumption of fossil fuels. When Smith pointed out that rates of sea-level rise have only increased slightly compared with the rate of fossil fuel use, Duffy pointed out that his chart was from a single tide gauge station, near San Francisco, and that sea levels rise at different rates around the world. Smith did not show rising atmospheric CO2 levels or temperatures, both of which have climbed steadily in recent decades as emissions have increased.

""The rate of global sea-level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago,"" Duffy told Smith in response to the charts.

""Is this chart inaccurate, then?"" Smith asked.

""It's accurate, but it doesn't represent what's happening globally; it represents what's happening in San Francisco,"" Duffy said.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) questioned Duffy on the factors that contribute to sea-level rise, pointing out that land subsidence plays a role, as well as human activity.

Brooks then said that erosion plays a significant role in sea-level rise, which is not an idea embraced by mainstream climate researchers. He said the California coastline and the White Cliffs of Dover tumble into the sea every year, and that contributes to sea-level rise. He also said that silt washing into the ocean from the world's major rivers, including the Mississippi, the Amazon and the Nile, is contributing to sea-level rise.

""Every time you have that soil or rock or whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise, because now you have less space in those oceans, because the bottom is moving up,"" Brooks said.

Duffy responded: ""I'm pretty sure that on human time scales, those are minuscule effects.""

Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing. That was true a few years ago, and scientists say it does not disprove the theory of global warming because different factors affect the Arctic and Antarctic rates of melting.

""We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage,"" Duffy said.

""I'm sorry, but I don't know where you're getting your information, but the data I have seen suggests — "" Brooks said.

Duffy answered: ""The National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.""

""Well, I've got a NASA base in my district, and apparently, they're telling you one thing and me a different thing,"" Brooks said. ""But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing. Now, you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic.""

Earlier this year, NASA researchers determined that Antarctica's ice loss has accelerated in the last decade. More broadly, sea ice extent at both poles set a record low last year. Scientists are racing to better understand the changes occurring in Antarctica because much of its ice is land-based, meaning it could drive sea-level rise around the world as it melts.

Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) said scientists said in the 1970s that the Earth was cooling, a popular talking point of climate skeptics and the subject of a fake Time magazine cover that has become a meme. Duffy corrected him and said that was essentially an outlier position at the time and that scientists long ago determined that humans were warming the planet.

Posey also asked how carbon dioxide could be captured in permafrost in the periods before humans existed. Duffy told him that it was from non-decayed organic matter. Human activity is now causing the Arctic to warm and thaw the ground, releasing the carbon into the atmosphere, Duffy said.

Posey then asked about theories related to warming being beneficial for habitats and to people.

""What do you say to people who theorize that the Earth as it continues to warm is returning to its normal temperature?"" Posey asked.

""Look, if you want to characterize a temperature above today's temperature as normal, you're free to do that, but that doesn't mean that's a planet we want to live on,"" Duffy said.

""I don't want to get philosophical; I'm trying to stay on science here,"" Posey said.

""I'm not getting philosophical; I'm getting extremely practical,"" Duffy said. ""I'm being extremely practical — if we let the planet warm 2 or 3 degrees, we will have tens of meters of sea-level rise, and the community where I live will essentially cease to exist.""

Posey responded: ""I don't think anybody disputes that the Earth is getting warmer; I think what's not clear is the exact amount of who caused what, and getting to that is, I think, where we're trying to go with this committee.""",,Neutral,55,"This article in the news section of Science—syndicated from E&E News—covers a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Science, Space, and Technology Committee. During the hearing, some committee members made a number of incorrect claims about climate change and sea level rise. Most notably, Representative Mo Brooks claimed that the erosion of coastal rock and sediment could be the real cause of sea level rise. The article focuses on creating an account of statements made by those present at the hearing.

Scientists who reviewed this article provided varying ratings, as the article generally noted that these claims were false but did not always explicitly explain the actual state of scientific knowledge. For example, providing references to published research directly contradicting these claims could have helped readers ascertain the truth.

This is part of a series of reviews of 2018’s most popular climate stories on social media.",,,,,"Andrew Shepherd, Professor, University of Leeds","The article itself is I believe a well-intentioned attempt to report on what seems to have been a rather chaotic committee meeting; although the meeting topic was intended to be on technologies to mitigate climate change, the discussion concentrated on basic climate change principles and conjecture which the witnesses could reasonably have not expected.

Although the article is good in places, I have graded it as very low credibility because there are several committee member statements that are false and not adequately corrected in the printed article.

1) The article opens with three apparently controversial statements attributed to a committee member that are not immediately corrected with facts, when they could have been: the Earth is warming. Sea level rise due to coastal erosion is insignificant in comparison to other known sources and sinks. The Antarctic ice sheet is not growing.

2) A committee member objects to the suggestion that global warming is man-made, stating that “basically we should all be open to different points of view”. This statement should have been rebutted, as the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming and it is not reasonable to assert that objection to scientific fact or consensus amounts to an alternative point of view.

3) A committee member suggests that land erosion is causing sea level rise: while the witness (Duffy) responds that he is “pretty sure” this is not the case, a factual correction could have been offered to shoot the suggestion down.

4) A committee member suggests that “there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing.” As leader of the international community effort responsible for charting polar ice sheet contributions to sea level rise, I can assure you that this statement is false. There is in fact only one study that reports growth of the Antarctic ice sheet, against all others (dozens) that report that it has lost ice. And the one study[1] that reported mass gains was effectively rebutted by a separate study[2]. For a summary of ice sheet mass balance data, see Figure 1 here.

The comments from the members of the Committee suffer from severe inaccuracies and misconceptions, and citations of the invited climate scientist mostly address those issues.

In general, the views that go against our understanding of the climate change process are underlined and presented as such by the author, but rarely supported by statements or explanations that go beyond the immediate replies from the invited climate scientist. Some of the inaccurate statements quoted in the text are thus left with an incomplete challenge. In particular, the concluding statement should have been challenged. The explanations sometimes suffer from imprecise language (land/sea ice, sea level rise timescales) but they are usually adequate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“I’m being extremely practical — if we let the planet warm 2 or 3 degrees, we will have tens of meters of sea-level rise, and the community where I live will essentially cease to exist.”","Sea level rise is undoubtedly one of the most severe consequences of anthropogenic climate change, but this statement should discuss timescales and present a revised amplitude. In fact, over the 21st century, estimates of global mean sea level rise are rather in the 1-2 m range[1]. Considering the global mean sea level rise commitment induced by these conditions up to 2300 leads to estimates reaching several meters[1]. Such a change in mean sea level will significantly impact coastal communities around the world.

During episodes in the geological past with similar temperature and CO2 conditions, like the mid-Pliocene around 3 million years ago, sea level may have reached significantly higher values (raising questions about the long-term equilibrium of sea level), but constraining precisely this quantity using the geological record remains challenging.

"BBC article on IPCC report is mostly accurate, but could use some clarification",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/bbc-article-on-ipcc-report-is-mostly-accurate-but-could-use-some-clarification/,Final call to save the world from 'climate catastrophe',https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45775309,"It's the final call, say scientists, in the most extensive warning yet on the risks of rising global temperatures.

Their dramatic report on keeping that rise under 1.5 degrees C says the world is now completely off track, heading instead towards 3C.

Keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"".

It will be hugely expensive - but the window of opportunity remains open.

After three years of research and a week of haggling between scientists and government officials at a meeting in South Korea, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5C.

What could be wiped out by temperature rise
What is climate change?
The critical 33-page Summary for Policymakers certainly bears the hallmarks of difficult negotiations between climate researchers determined to stick to what their studies have shown and political representatives more concerned with economies and living standards.

Despite the inevitable compromises, there are some key messages that come through loud and clear.

""The first is that limiting warming to 1.5C brings a lot of benefits compared with limiting it to two degrees. It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways,"" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs the IPCC.

""The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems, changes to the way we manage land, changes to the way we move around with transportation.""

 What's one big takeaway?
""Scientists might want to write in capital letters, 'ACT NOW, IDIOTS,' but they need to say that with facts and numbers,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, of Greenpeace, who was an observer at the negotiations. ""And they have.""

The researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever, caused by humans. We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century, then the changes we would experience would be manageable.

Not any more. This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet's liveability. And the 1.5C temperature ""guard rail"" could be exceeded in just 12 years, in 2030.

We can stay below it - but it will require urgent, large-scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year, about 2.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all goods and services produced, for two decades.

Even then, we will still need machines, trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever.

What can I do?
The report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems:

energy • land use • cities • industry
But it adds that the world cannot meet its target without changes by individuals, urging people to:

buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter and more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away • drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances • take trains and buses instead of planes • use videoconferencing instead of business travel • use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer • insulate homes • demand low carbon in every consumer product
Lifestyle changes can make a big difference, said Dr Debra Roberts, the IPCC's other co-chair.

""That's a very empowering message for the individual,"" she said. ""This is not about remote science; it is about where we live and work, and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change, because everyone is going to have to be involved.""

""You might say you don't have control over land use, but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use.

""We can choose the way we move in cities and if we don't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport.""

Five steps to 1.5
Global emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030
Renewables are estimated to provide up to 85% of global electricity by 2050
Coal is expected to reduce to close to zero
Up to seven million sq km of land will be needed for energy crops (a bit less than the size of Australia)
Global net zero emissions by 2050

How much will all this cost?
It won't come cheap. The report says to limit warming to 1.5C, will involve ""annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $2.4 trillion"" between 2016 and 2035.

Experts believe this number needs to be put in context.

""There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius, a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF. He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century.

""The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you don't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two.""

Five things we have learned from the report
Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say
Vietnam's children and the fear of climate change

What happens if we don't act?
The researchers say that if we fail to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, we are in for some significant and dangerous changes to our world.

You can kiss coral reefs goodbye, as the report says they would be essentially 100% wiped out at two degrees of warming.

Global sea-level will rise about 10cm (4in) more if we let warming go to 2C. That may not sound like much but keeping to 1.5C means that 10 million fewer people would be exposed to the risks of flooding.

There are also significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

""We are already in the danger zone at one degree of warming,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace. ""Both poles are melting at an accelerated rate; ancient trees that have been there for hundreds of years are suddenly dying; and the summer we've just experienced - basically, the whole world was on fire.""

Is this plan at all feasible?
Analysis by David Shukman, BBC science editor

The countdown to the worst of global warming seems to have accelerated. Seriously damaging impacts are no longer on a distant horizon later this century but within a timeframe that appears uncomfortably close.

By the same token, the report's ""pathways"" for keeping a lid on temperatures all mean that hard decisions cannot be delayed:

a shift away from fossil fuels by mid-century
coal phased out far sooner than previously suggested
vast tracts of land given over to forests
It's mind-bending stuff and some will say it's hopelessly unrealistic, a climate scientists' fantasy. So is any of it plausible? On the one hand, the global economy relies on carbon and key activities depend on it. On the other, wind turbines and solar panels have tumbled in price and more and more countries and states such as California are setting ambitious green targets.

Ultimately, politicians will face a difficult choice: persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong.

Is all this about saving small island states?
The idea of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 is something very close to the hearts and minds of small island and low-lying states, which fear being inundated with flooding if temperatures go to two degrees.

But over the three years that the report was in preparation, more and more scientific evidence has been published showing the benefits of staying close to 1.5C are not just for island nations in the Pacific.

""If you save a small island country, then you save the world,"" said Dr Amjad Abdulla, an IPCC author, from the Maldives. ""Because the report clearly states that no-one is going to be immune. It's about morality - it's about humanity.""

How long have we got?
Not long at all. But that issue is now in the hands of political leaders. The report says hard decisions can no longer be kicked down the road. If the nations of the world don't act soon, they will have to rely even more on unproven technologies to take carbon out of the air - an expensive and uncertain road.

""They really need to start work immediately. The report is clear that if governments just fulfil the pledges they made in the Paris agreement for 2030, it is not good enough. It will make it very difficult to consider global warming of 1.5C,"" said Prof Jim Skea.

""If they read the report and decide to increase their ambitions and act more immediately, then 1.5C stays within reach - that's the nature of the choice they face.""

Campaigners and environmentalists, who have welcomed the report, say there is simply no time left for debate.

""This is the moment where we need to decide"" said Kaisa Kosonen. ""We want to move to clean energy, sustainable lifestyles. We want to protect our forests and species. This is the moment that we will remember; this is the year when the turning point happened.""",high,Accurate,1,"This BBC story covered the October release of the IPCC’s “Global Warming of 1.5 °C” report.

(In this case, Working Group 2 on impacts and Working Group 3 on mitigation and solutions, respectively.)

The article also provides statements without context, despite this being essential for their interpretation. For example, the annual investment needs in the energy sector for achieving a 1.5°C compatible pathway are indeed roughly 2.5% of global GDP, but this compares to about 1.8% of global GDP in a world in which we put the world on track for 4°C by the end of the century. The difference in investments is also roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the annual percentage of GDP we spend on energy. The absence of this context makes it impossible to judge whether the editor’s value judgment that limiting warming to 1.5°C would be “hugely expensive”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNN accurately covers latest IPCC report,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/cnn-accurately-covers-latest-ipcc-report-brandon-miller/,"Planet has only until 2030 to stem catastrophic climate change, experts warn",https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/07/world/climate-change-new-ipcc-report-wxc/index.html,"CNN —  Governments around the world must take “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” to avoid disastrous levels of global warming, says a stark new report from the global scientific authority on climate change.

The report issued Monday by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), says the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.

The date, which falls well within the lifetime of many people alive today, is based on current levels of greenhouse gas emissions.

The planet is already two-thirds of the way there, with global temperatures having warmed about 1 degree C. Avoiding going even higher will require significant action in the next few years.

“This is concerning because we know there are so many more problems if we exceed 1.5 degrees C global warming, including more heatwaves and hot summers, greater sea level rise, and, for many parts of the world, worse droughts and rainfall extremes,” Andrew King, a lecturer in climate science at the University of Melbourne, said in a statement.

Global net emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach “net zero” around 2050 in order to keep the warming around 1.5 degrees C.

Lowering emissions to this degree, while technically possible, would require widespread changes in energy, industry, buildings, transportation and cities, the report says.

“The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal,” added King.

The report makes it clear that climate change is already happening – and what comes next could be even worse, unless urgent international political action is taken.

Consequences of past inaction
“One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1 degree C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes,” said Panmao Zhai, co-chair of IPCC Working Group I.

Even if warming is kept at or just below 1.5 degrees C, the impacts will be widespread and significant.

Temperatures during summer heatwaves, such as those just experienced across Europe this summer, can be expected to increase by 3 degrees C says the report.

More frequent or intense droughts, such as the one that nearly ran the taps dry in Cape Town, South Africa, as well as more frequent extreme rainfall events such as hurricanes Harvey and Florence in the United States, are also pointed to as expectations as we reach the warming threshold.

Coral reefs will also be drastically affected, with between 70 and 90% expected to die off, including Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.

Countries in the southern hemisphere will be among the worse off, the report said, “projected to experience the largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase.”

The report underlines how even the smallest increase in the base target would worsen the impact of recent natural disasters.

“Every extra bit of warming matters, especially since warming of 1.5 degrees C or higher increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes, such as the loss of some ecosystems,” said Hans-Otto Pörtner, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II.

The report cites specific examples of how impacts of global warming would be lessened with the 1.5 degrees C increase, compared to the 2 degrees C increase:

Global sea levels would rise 10 cm lower by 2100.
The likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century, instead of at least once per decade.
Coral reefs would decline by 70% to 90% instead of being almost completely wiped out.

’Possible with the laws of chemistry and physics’
Monday’s report is three years in the making and is a direct result of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. In the Paris accord, 197 countries agreed to the goal of holding global temperatures “well below” 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C.

The United States was initially in the agreement, but President Donald Trump pulled the country out a year and half later, claiming it was unfair to the country.

To limit global warming to 1.5 degree C is “possible within the laws of chemistry and physics,” said Jim Skea, co-chair of IPCC Working Group III. “But doing so would require unprecedented changes.”

“International cooperation is absolutely imperative to limit emissions and therefore global warming and its impacts, as well as coordinating effective and widespread adaptation and mitigation,” said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a fellow at the Climate Change Research Center at the University of New South Wales. “The next few years will be critical in the evolution of these efforts.”

One key issue will be negative emissions, large scale carbon-scrubbing technologies that can reduce the amount in the atmosphere and act to counter continued pollution.

According to the report, there are two main ways of removing carbon from the atmosphere: increasing natural processes that already do this, and experimental carbon storage or removal technologies.

However, all methods “are at different stages of development and some are more conceptual than others, as they have not been tested at scale,” the report warned.

They will also require considerable political engagement globally, as will reducing the amount of carbon being emitted. Despite the report’s dire warnings, there is no indication such cooperation will be doable, particularly given the Trump administration’s stance on this issue.

“Today the world’s leading scientific experts collectively reinforced what mother nature has made clear – that we need to undergo an urgent and rapid transformation to a global clean energy economy,” former US Vice President Al Gore said.

“Unfortunately, the Trump administration has become a rogue outlier in its shortsighted attempt to prop up the dirty fossil fuel industries of the past. The administration is in direct conflict with American businesses, states, cities and citizens leading the transformation.”","high, very_high",Accurate,5,"This CNN story covered the October release of the IPCC’s “Global Warming of 1.5 °C” report.

USA Today story updates readers on trend in monthly global temperatures,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/usa-today-story-updates-readers-on-trend-in-monthly-global-temperatures-doyle-rice/,Earth just had its 400th straight warmer-than-average month thanks to global warming,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/05/17/global-warming-april-400th-consecutive-warm-month/618484002/,"It was December 1984, and President Reagan had just been elected to his second term, Dynasty was the top show on TV and Madonna's Like a Virgin topped the musical charts.

It was also the last time the Earth had a cooler-than-average month.

Last month marked the planet's 400th consecutive month with above-average temperatures, federal scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday. 

The cause for the streak? Unquestionably, it’s climate change, caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels. 

""We live in and share a world that is unequivocally, appreciably and consequentially warmer than just a few decades ago, and our world continues to warm,"" said NOAA climate scientist Deke Arndt. ""Speeding by a '400' sign only underscores that, but it does not prove anything new.""

Climate scientists use the 20th-century average as a benchmark for global temperature measurements. That's because it's fixed in time, allowing for consistent ""goal posts"" when reviewing climate data. It's also a sufficiently long period to include several cycles of climate variability.

""The thing that really matters is that, by whatever metric, we've spent every month for several decades on the warm side of any reasonable baseline,"" Arndt said.

NOAA's analysis found last month was the 3rd-warmest April on record globally. The unusual heat was most noteworthy in Europe, which had its warmest April on record, and Australia, which had its second-warmest.

Portions of Asia also experienced some extreme heat: In southern Pakistan, the town of Nawabshah soared to a scalding 122.4 degrees on April 30, which may have been the warmest April temperature on record for the globe, according to Meteo France. 

Argentina also had its warmest April since national records began there in 1961.

North America was the one part of the world that didn't get in on the heat parade. Last month, the average U.S. temperature was 48.9 degrees, 2.2 degrees below average, ""making it the 13th-coldest April on record and the coldest since 1997,"" NOAA said.

For the year-to-date, the Earth is seeing its 5th-warmest start to the year. 

A separate analysis of global temperature data from NASA also found last month was the third-warmest April on record. 

Another milestone was reached in April, also related to the number ""400"": Carbon dioxide — the gas scientists say is most responsible for global warming — reached its highest level in recorded history at 410 parts per million.

This amount is highest in at least the past 800,000 years, according to the Scripps Institute of Oceanography.",very_high,Accurate,37,"This article in USA Today notes that April 2018 was the 400th straight month that global temperatures were above the 20th century average, and correctly identifies human activities as the cause of this trend.

Washington Post article accurately discusses warm Arctic weather event,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-article-accurately-discusses-warm-arctic-weather-event-jason-samenow/,"North Pole surges above freezing in the dead of winter, stunning scientists",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/02/26/north-pole-surges-above-freezing-in-the-dead-of-winter-stunning-scientists/,"The sun won’t rise at the North Pole until March 20, and it’s normally close to the coldest time of year, but an extraordinary and possibly historic thaw swelled over the tip of the planet this weekend. Analyses show that the temperature warmed to the melting point as an enormous storm pumped an intense pulse of heat through the Greenland Sea.

Temperatures may have soared as high as 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) at the pole, according to the U.S. Global Forecast System model. While there are no direct measurements of temperature there, Zack Labe, a climate scientist working on his PhD at the University of California at Irvine, confirmed that several independent analyses showed “it was very close to freezing,” which is more than 50 degrees (30 degrees Celsius) above normal.

The warm intrusion penetrated right through the heart of the Central Arctic, Labe said. The temperature averaged for the entire region north of 80 degrees latitude spiked to its highest level ever recorded in February. The average temperature was more than 36 degrees (20 degrees Celsius) above normal. “No other warm intrusions were very close to this,” Labe said in an interview, describing a data set maintained by the Danish Meteorological Institute that dates back to 1958. “I was taken by surprise how expansive this warm intrusion was.”

Such extreme warm intrusions in the Arctic, once rare, are becoming more routine, research has shown. A study published last July found that since 1980, these events are becoming more frequent, longer-lasting and more intense.

“Previously this was not common,” said lead author of the study Robert Graham, from the Norwegian Polar Institute, in an email. “It happened in four years between 1980-2010, but has now occurred in four out of the last five winters.”

Arctic temperatures soar 45 degrees above normal, flooded by extremely mild air on all sides

Graham explained that these warming events are related to the decline of winter sea ice in the Arctic, noting that January’s ice extent was the lowest on record. “As the sea ice is melting and thinning, it is becoming more vulnerable to these winter storms,” he explained. “The thinner ice drifts more quickly and can break up into smaller pieces. The strong winds from the south can push the ice further north into the Central Arctic, exposing the open water and releasing heat to the atmosphere from the ocean.”

Scientists were shocked in recent days to discover open water north of Greenland, an area normally covered by old, very thick ice. “This has me more worried than the warm temps in the Arctic right now,” tweeted Mike MacFerrin, an ice sheet specialist at the University of Colorado.

Such warm water is appearing to have an effect on air temperatures. At the north tip of Greenland, about 400 miles to the south of the North Pole, the weather station Cape Morris Jesup has logged a record-crushing 61 hours above freezing so far this calendar year. The previous record, dating to 1980, was 16 hours through the end of April in 2011, according to Robert Rohde, a physicist at Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit that conducts temperature analysis. At one point, the temperature was as high as 43 degrees (6.1 degrees Celsius).

Kent Moore, a professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Toronto, who published a study in 2016 linking the loss of sea ice to these warm events in the Arctic, said a number of factors may have contributed to the latest warming episode.

For one, he said, recent storms have tracked more toward the North Pole through the Greenland Sea, drawing heat directly north from lower latitudes, rather than through a more circuitous route over the Barents Sea. He also said ocean temperatures in the Greenland Sea are warmer than normal. “The warmth we’re seeing in the Greenland Sea is definitely enhancing the warm events we’re seeing,” Moore said. “I’m surprised how warm it is, but I am not sure why.”

The rise in Arctic temperatures is probably also tied to a sudden warming of the stratosphere, the atmospheric layer about 30,000 feet high — above where most weather happens — that occurred several weeks ago, Moore said.  Why these stratospheric warming events happen is poorly understood, as are their consequences. However, they tend to rearrange warm and cold air masses, and this latest one has also been linked not only to the Arctic warmth but also to the “Beast from the East” cold spell over Europe.

Moore stopped short of saying that the warm spikes observed in the Arctic in recent years are a sure sign that they are becoming a fixture of the winter Arctic climate; more data is needed, he cautioned.

Whether a blip or indicative of a new normal, scientists have uniformly expressed disbelief at the current Arctic temperatures and the state of the sea ice.

“This is a crazy winter,” said Alek Petty, a climate scientist at NASA, in an interview. “I don’t think we’re sensationalizing it.”

It stitches together dozens of unoriginal myths about climate science that have been debunked over and over again.,"Mark Richardson, Research Associate, Colorado State University/NASA JPL","This video is shameful and full of well-known tricks that deceive people about global warming. Almost every statement is false or misleading. Radiometer measurements of Earth’s atmosphere confirm CO2‘s heating effect just as expected, and other instruments rule out the Sun or volcanoes. There are specific “fingerprints” in patterns of warming that match CO2 caused warming and we have measured increasing water vapour in the air in response, just as predicted decades ago. This video is an embarrassment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,“There is no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of Global Warming”,"This is not true.

The primary empirical evidence that greenhouse gasses cause global warming is the absorption (as a function of wavelength of radiation) of gasses like CO2, CH4 and N2O. This was discovered in 1859 by John Tyndall and has become a part of fundamental physics. Anyone can check this empirical relationship at any time with an absorption spectroscopy device.

The empirical evidence that increases in greenhouse gas concentrations (from fossil fuel burning) are the primary cause of century-scale warming is that observed global temperatures have risen in line with what would be expected from the observed increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and observations of natural drivers of climate change (e.g. solar output and volcanic eruptions) indicate that natural drivers are not causing warming.","The initial claim that there is no empirical evidence is unfalsifiable. What evidence would be required? A manipulation of multiple identical planets, one group with fossil fuel burning etc, the other group with no humans. There is empirical evidence that CO2 is increasing, there is empirical evidence that this is from fossil fuel burning, there is evidence that this is altering the radiative balance of the planet, there is empirical evidence that global temperatures are increasing. The IPCC reports have all the latest references for these various evidence streams.","The greenhouse effect exists on other planets in the Solar System and explains why planets like Venus have such a hot surface. The big picture is explained in the paper “A mental picture of the greenhouse effect”*, which also presents some empirical evidence contrary to the false statement in the video. The challenge, rather, would be to explain why increased levels of greenhouse gases potentially would not influence the greenhouse effect. (It does).

Benestad (2016) A mental picture of the greenhouse effect, Theoretical and Applied Climatology",,"“Today climate scientists are obsessed with the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a very very small part of the overall picture. Carbon dioxide is a trace gas.”","The small percent of CO2 by volume in the atmosphere (what makes it a trace gas) is utterly irrelevant in terms of its radiative properties and thus its effect on global temperature.

Climate scientists pay special attention to CO2 because its radiative properties have allowed it to be the dominant cause of warming over the past century.",When the speaker is willing to inject such a “trace amount” of ebola or ricin into their own body I’ll believe that they were being serious with this argument.,,,"“But what is nature’s most abundant greenhouse gas? Water vapor. It’s not carbon dioxide, it’s not methane… Scientists estimate that somewhere between 75% and 90% of Earth greenhouse effect is caused by water vapor in clouds.”","Ironically, the paper that he is citing here is called “Atmospheric CO2: Principal Control Knob Governing Earth’s Temperature”[1]. The abstract explains why CO2 is the control knob even if it does not make up a majority of the current greenhouse effect:

“Ample physical evidence shows that carbon dioxide (CO2) is the single most important climate-relevant greenhouse gas in Earth’s atmosphere. This is because CO2, like ozone, N2O, CH4, and chlorofluorocarbons, does not condense and precipitate from the atmosphere at current climate temperatures, whereas water vapor can and does. Noncondensing greenhouse gases, which account for 25% of the total terrestrial greenhouse effect, thus serve to provide the stable temperature structure that sustains the current levels of atmospheric water vapor and clouds via feedback processes that account for the remaining 75% of the greenhouse effect. Without the radiative forcing supplied by CO2 and the other noncondensing greenhouse gases, the terrestrial greenhouse would collapse, plunging the global climate into an icebound Earth state.”

If you took the CO2 out and we lost 20 % of the greenhouse effect, Earth would cool down and lots of the vapour would rain out. The amount of water vapour responds to temperature and circulation, nowadays CO2 is the driver.",,,"“Every day, nature puts twenty times as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as all of Earth industries. That means that humans are responsible for about one or two parts per hundred over its greenhouse effect.”","A classic misleading climate skeptic talking point which confuses the natural zero-sum turnover, which does not add anything to the atmosphere, with the net addition by human activities. A few scientifically uncontroversial facts: 1) Since the beginning of industrialization, the CO2 concentration has risen from 280 ppm (the value of the previous millennia of the Holocene) to now 405 ppm. 2) This increase by 45 percent (or 125 ppm) is completely caused by humans. 3) The CO2 concentration is thus now already higher than it has been for several million years. (Full explanation here.)",This is wrong. Nature puts in more CO2 than industry but nature also takes out exactly what it puts in (on century timescales). This means that nature puts essentially zero NET CO2 into the atmosphere. The rise in atmospheric CO2 since the Industrial Revolution has been entirely driven by human burning of fossil fuels.,"The important point is that the net effect to the CO2 exchanged between different parts leads to a rise in the CO2-concentration, which now has passed 400 parts per million. There is no doubt that the increase in the concentration is due to burning of fossil fuels—it’s easy to calculate based on the amount of oil, gas and coal that is burned, and the chemistry. A comparison between the sizes of the various fluxes between the different parts clutters the discussion. Furthermore, water vapour (H2O) has a short life time in the atmosphere compared to CO2. It rains out after a few days whereas CO2-levels stay for centuries.",,"“So it’s clear now we’re not seeing dangerous global warming, and the climate models are wrong.”","We have done a bunch of comparisons with models and observations. The surface observations are more reliable because there are so many of them, and satellite infrared (think Predator vision) backs them up.

We checked from the 1860s to today and it’s remarkable how well the observed warming matches the modelled warming*.

But one problem is that humans and ecosystems live on the Earth’s surface and this is data for the mid-atmosphere. Observations of surface temperature through 2018 are more or less in the center of the climate model predicted range.,"The claim is false: the graph shows a misguided comparison between (1) the average of climate model simulations for a part of the upper atmosphere that is strongly affected by the clouds and the Hadley cell in the Tropics, (2) temperature derived from satellite measurements, and (3) balloon data. This exercise fails on statistical terms, since the comparison should be carried out between all individual climate models (to show the their spread)—one cannot expect the average value to match the one that is measured, just as one does not expect that the temperature in Washington always to be the same as the mean temperature in Washington. There are also issues with using the satellite data as a reference, since satellites do not measure temperature directly. They measure light and make use of algorithms based on the same principles, as those used in the climate models, to estimate the temperatures. Hence, the satellite data are also model results, and the comparison between the two is like comparing different models. The satellite data data have some issues regarding how different records are stitched together from different missions and how the signal is affected by clouds and other factors. The balloon (radiosondes) do not give a good representation over the upper air, as there are few of them. More information.

To understand this, one needs to model the climate and how it matters for the atmospheric circulation and the planetary energy balance. In some regions, it gets drier (typically the subtropics) and in others there is increasing precipitation (typically the mid-latitudes). There are some indications that the rain on a global scale is getting more intense and concentrated over a diminishing area*.

This is because the natural causes of climate change that are active on these timescales should have either caused cooling or no change in temperature without human influence.,"If anything, the Sun has cooled in recent decades.

The picture shown is a well-known fake.,"From the 1940s to the 1970s, the global surface temperature decreased very slightly. This probably occurred because over that time period the cooling effect from human produced aerosols was slightly larger than the warming effect from human produced greenhouse gasses. A minority of scientists predicted that the cooling effect from increasing aerosols would continue to outweigh the warming effect from increasing greenhouse gasses and that the climate would continue to cool. This idea received some public attention when Time magazine published an article titled “Another Ice Age?” in 1974 (the cover of Time shown in the video is a fake). Regardless, this article did not represent the views of the majority of the scientific literature at the time1. For example, a 1975 paper, published by Wallace Broecker2 contained the following abstract:

“If man-made dust is unimportant as a major cause of climatic change, then a strong case can be made that the present cooling trend will, within a decade or so, give way to a pronounced warming induced by carbon dioxide. By analogy with similar events in the past, the natural climatic cooling which, since 1940, has more than compensated for the carbon dioxide effect, will soon bottom out. Once this happens, the exponential rise in the atmospheric carbon dioxide content will tend to become a significant factor and by early in the next century will have driven the mean planetary temperature beyond the limits experienced during the last 1000 years.”

This prediction turned out to be remarkably accurate.

The sea-ice extent is more strongly influenced by the salinity of the surface water, ocean currents and winds.

Ice loss from Greenland has accelerated over the last 3 decades and in the recent decade Greenland has lost about 300 gigatons of ice per year (almost 1 mm of sea level rise per year). This paper[1] provides a good overview. Also, Greenland glacier ice is not ‘rock solid’.

2017 was once again one of the hottest years on record, ranked as the second-warmest by NASA and third-warmest by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The findings “continue the planet’s long-term warming trend,” according to NASA. A trend that is driven predominately by human activity through carbon dioxide emissions.

Temperature records for the planet, monitored independently by both agencies, go back to 1880. The announcement came at a joint press conference on Thursday in Washington.

The hottest year on record remains 2016, while 2015 ranks second according to NOAA and third by NASA, which means the top three years have been the most recent three.

Though 2017 was slightly cooler on average compared to 2016. the trend towards a warmer planet has never been clearer.

The six hottest years have all occurred since 2010 and 17 of the 18 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001.

According to NASA, the globally averaged temperature of the land and ocean was 0.9˚C (1.62˚F) above the 20th century average. This puts us well over halfway to the ambitious target of limiting warming to 1.5˚ C (2.7˚F) set in the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement.

Scientists believe if that if we are to avoid exceeding that limit, carbon emissions would need to be significantly reduced starting immediately.

La Niña not enough to cool us down
The slight downturn in temperatures this year can be partially explained by the presence of La Niña, which began in late 2016 and lasted into 2017 and returned late in the year — whereas a robust El Niño was in place during portions of 2015 and 2016.

El Niño is characterized by a warming of the surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean — which tends to drive up global temperatures. Therefore years containing El Niños tend to be warmer globally than other years.

La Niñas, on the other hand, feature cooler than average waters in the Pacific, and tend to cool the planet down.

The fact that 2017 was the second- or third-warmest year on record, despite the presence of a cooling La Niña, speaks to the overall warming trend the Earth is experiencing thanks to overall global warming.

According to NASA, if “the effects of the recent El Niño and La Niña patterns were statistically removed from the record, 2017 would have been the warmest year on record.”

Global climate highlights of 2017
Sea ice continued its declining trend, both in the Arctic and Antarctic. The Antarctic, which was trending at record high levels just a few years ago, reached a record low during 2017, with ice covering 154,000 fewer square miles than the previous record low set in 1986.

In the Arctic, sea ice extent was the second-lowest since records began in 1979, behind only 2016, though record low sea ice was observed during the winter months of January-March.

Temperatures significantly warmer than normal around the planet did not mean there was a lack of snow, however. In the northern hemisphere, the average snow cover extent was the largest since 1985 and the eighth largest since records began in 1968, according to Rutgers University’s Global Snow Lab.

Over the past quarter-century, Earth’s oceans have retained 60 percent more heat each year than scientists previously had thought, said Laure Resplandy, a geoscientist at Princeton University who led the startling study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. The difference represents an enormous amount of additional energy, originating from the sun and trapped by Earth’s atmosphere — the yearly amount representing more than eight times the world’s annual energy consumption.

In the scientific realm, the new findings help resolve long-running doubts about the rate of the warming of the oceans before 2007, when reliable measurements from devices called “Argo floats” were put to use worldwide. Before that, differing types of temperature records — and an overall lack of them — contributed to murkiness about how quickly the oceans were heating up.

The higher-than-expected amount of heat in the oceans means more heat is being retained within Earth’s climate system each year, rather than escaping into space. In essence, more heat in the oceans signals that global warming is more advanced than scientists thought.

“We thought that we got away with not a lot of warming in both the ocean and the atmosphere for the amount of CO2 that we emitted,” said Resplandy, who published the work with experts from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and several other institutions in the United States, China, France and Germany. “But we were wrong. The planet warmed more than we thought. It was hidden from us just because we didn’t sample it right. But it was there. It was in the ocean already.”

Wednesday’s study also could have important policy implications. If ocean temperatures are rising more rapidly than previously calculated, that could leave nations even less time to dramatically cut the world’s emissions of carbon dioxide, in the hope of limiting global warming to the ambitious goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels by the end of this century.

The world already has warmed one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 19th century. Scientists backed by the United Nations reported this month that with warming projected to steadily increase, the world faces a daunting challenge in trying to limit that warming to only another half-degree Celsius. The group found that it would take “unprecedented” action by leaders across the globe over the coming decade to even have a shot at that goal.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has continued to roll back regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions from vehicles, coal plants and other sources and has said it intends to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. In one instance, the administration relied on an assumption that the planet will warm a disastrous seven degrees Fahrenheit, or about four degrees Celsius, by the end of the century in arguing that a proposal to ease vehicle fuel-efficiency standards would have only minor climate impacts.

The new research underscores the potential consequences of global inaction. Rapidly warming oceans mean that seas will rise faster and that more heat will be delivered to critical locations that already are facing the effects of a warming climate, such as coral reefs in the tropics and the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica.

“In case the larger estimate of ocean heat uptake turns out to be true, adaptation to — and mitigation of — our changing climate would become more urgent,” said Pieter Tans, who is the leader of the Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases Group at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and was not involved in the study.

The oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess energy trapped within the world’s atmosphere.

The new research does not measure the ocean’s temperature directly. Rather, it measures the volume of gases, specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide, that have escaped the ocean in recent decades and headed into the atmosphere as it heats up. The method offered scientists a reliable indicator of ocean temperature change because it reflects a fundamental behavior of a liquid when heated.

“When the ocean warms, it loses some gas to the atmosphere,” Resplandy said. “That’s an analogy that I make all the time: If you leave your Coke in the sun, it will lose the gas.”

This approach allowed researchers to recheck the contested history of ocean temperatures in a different and novel way. In doing so, they came up with a higher number for how much warming the oceans have experienced over time.

“I feel like this is a triumph of Earth-system science. That we could get confirmation from atmospheric gases of ocean heat content is extraordinary,” said Joellen Russell, a professor and oceanographer at the University of Arizona. “You’ve got the A team here on this paper.”

But Russell said the findings are hardly as uplifting.

The report “does have implications for climate sensitivity, meaning, how warm does a certain amount of CO2 make us?” Russell said, adding that the world could have a smaller “carbon budget” than once thought. That budget refers to the amount of carbon dioxide humans can emit while still being able to keep warming below dangerous levels.

The scientists calculated that because of the increased heat already stored in the ocean, the maximum emissions that the world can produce while still avoiding a warming of two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) would have to be reduced by 25 percent. That represents a very significant shrinkage of an already very narrow carbon “budget.”

The U.N. panel of climate scientists said recently that global carbon emissions must be cut in half by 2030 if the world hopes to remain beneath 1.5 Celsius of warming. But Resplandy said that the evidence of faster-warming oceans “shifts the probability, making it harder to stay below the 1.5-degree temperature target.""

Understanding what is happening with Earth’s oceans is critical, because they, far more than the atmosphere, are the mirror of ongoing climate change.

According to a major climate report released last year by the U.S. government, the world’s oceans have absorbed about 93 percent of the excess heat caused by greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century. Scientists have found that ocean heat has increased at all depths since the 1960s, while surface waters also have warmed. The federal climate report projected a global increase in average sea surface temperatures of as much as nearly five degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if emissions continue unabated, with even higher levels of warming in some U.S. coastal regions.

The world’s oceans also absorb more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted annually from human activities — an effect making them more acidic and threatening fragile ecosystems, federal researchers say. “The rate of acidification is unparalleled in at least the past 66 million years,” the government climate report stated.

Paul Durack, a research scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, said Wednesday’s study offers “a really interesting new insight” and is “quite alarming.”

The warming found in the study is “more than twice the rates of long-term warming estimates from the 1960s and ’70s to the present,” Durack said, adding that if these rates are validated by further studies, “it means the rate of warming and the sensitivity of the Earth’s system to greenhouse gases is at the upper end.” He said that if scientists have underestimated the amount of heat taken up by the oceans, “it will mean we need to go back to the drawing board” on the aggressiveness of mitigation actions the world needs to take promptly to limit future warming.

Beyond the long-term implications of warmer oceans, Russell added that in the short term, even small changes in ocean temperatures can affect weather in specific places. For instance, scientists have said warmer oceans off the coast of New England have contributed to more-intense winter storms.

“We’re only just now discovering how important ocean warming is to our daily lives, to our daily weather,” she said.",high,"Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",124,"This article in The Washington Post covers a new study estimating the amount of heat energy that has accumulated in the ocean in recent decades. Such estimates have been limited because the most complete network of ocean temperatures did not exist until the 2000s. The new study uses an indirect method, instead relying on changes in atmospheric gases caused by warmer oceans. This method produces an estimate of ocean warming resulting from human activities that is similar to other estimates, within error bars.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that it did a good job of describing the study, while noting that the study’s conclusions (and implications) require additional investigation. In particular, discussion among scientists has focused on clarifying what impact this study’s results have on our understanding of climate sensitivity (how much warming occurs from a given amount of greenhouse gas emissions) and, consequently, how much the world can emit before reaching 2 °C warming.",,,,,"Mitch Lyle, Professor, Sr. Research, Oregon State University","The authors use a novel ocean heat content estimate that depends on gas exchange and atmospheric oxygen content. The conclusion are interesting, that climate sensitivity may be underestimated, but their “thermometer” needs to be confirmed.","Pepijn Bakker, Assistant professor, Department of Earth Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Netherlands","The article gives a good and balanced representation of the main new scientific insights. What I find inappropriate about the title is that it suggests that a large buildup of heat in the oceans is a new finding. This has been known for a long time, but what is novel is that this heat buildup now appears much larger than previously assumed.","Mark Richardson, Research Associate, Colorado State University/NASA JPL","This article covers a study1 that used precise measurements of gases in the air to infer ocean temperature change since 1991. This sounds crazy, but it’s basic physics that warming liquids release dissolved gases. The scientists accounted for other factors, checked against available ocean data and worked out that the oceans have sucked up more heat since 1991 than some other studies reported. The older studies often lacked data from the best instruments in places like the shallow seas around Indonesia so might have missed heat “hiding” in such regions2. The new study led by Dr. Resplandy of Princeton does not have this weakness and so is very credible.

The Washington Post article accurately reports the results and links to other topics using reliable sources. Quotations from Pieter Tans and Paul Durack add important caveats showing that this is strong new evidence but not the final say. This caution is vital for readers to interpret the findings.

The article then talks about what these results could mean for global warming and related political targets.

Most evidence, such as from satellite measurements of how clouds have changed with our warming climate3, suggest that we will see a lot more global warming from our emissions. By contrast, some simple “energy budget” calculations that used ocean heat data suggested less warming, but they relied on lower estimates of heat uptake with non-global measurements. The Post then reports how Resplandy’s new ocean heat findings would affect the “energy budget” results. The numbers they give are based on calculations from the research and are defensible.

I take issue with Durack’s quote that this “means the rate of warming and the sensitivity of the Earth’s system to greenhouse gases is at the upper end”. This is vague and probably overconfident: the data fit with a lot of warming in the pipeline, but plugging these numbers into one recent calculation4 could also imply relatively moderate future warming. This is overly harsh criticism for an article that tackles several tricky issues and, in my judgment, provides a well-supported and balanced discussion of a fascinating piece of new science.

Guardian story accurately describes study on environmental impacts of our food system,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-story-accurately-describes-study-on-environmental-impacts-of-our-food-system-damian-carrington/,Huge reduction in meat-eating ‘essential’ to avoid climate breakdown,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown,"Huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to avoid dangerous climate change, according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of the food system’s impact on the environment. In western countries, beef consumption needs to fall by 90% and be replaced by five times more beans and pulses.

The research also finds that enormous changes to farming are needed to avoid destroying the planet’s ability to feed the 10 billion people expected to be on the planet in a few decades.

Food production already causes great damage to the environment, via greenhouse gases from livestock, deforestation and water shortages from farming, and vast ocean dead zones from agricultural pollution. But without action, its impact will get far worse as the world population rises by 2.3 billion people by 2050 and global income triples, enabling more people to eat meat-rich western diets.

This trajectory would smash critical environmental limits beyond which humanity will struggle to live, the new research indicates. “It is pretty shocking,” said Marco Springmann at the University of Oxford, who led the research team. “We are really risking the sustainability of the whole system. If we are interested in people being able to farm and eat, then we better not do that.”

“Feeding a world population of 10 billion is possible, but only if we change the way we eat and the way we produce food,” said Prof Johan Rockström at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who was part of the research team. “Greening the food sector or eating up our planet: this is what is on the menu today.”

The new study follows the publication of a landmark UN report on Monday in which the world’s leading scientists warned there are just a dozen years in which to keep global warming under 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods and extreme heat. The report said eating less meat and dairy was important but said current trends were in the opposite direction.

The new research, published in the journal Nature, is the most thorough to date and combined data from every country to assess the impact of food production on the global environment. It then looked at what could be done to stop the looming food crisis.

“There is no magic bullet,” said Springmann. “But dietary and technological change [on farms] are the two essential things, and hopefully they can be complemented by reduction in food loss and waste.” About a third of food produced today never reaches the table.

The researchers found a global shift to a “flexitarian” diet was needed to keep climate change even under 2C, let alone 1.5C. This flexitarian diet means the average world citizen needs to eat 75% less beef, 90% less pork and half the number of eggs, while tripling consumption of beans and pulses and quadrupling nuts and seeds. This would halve emissions from livestock and better management of manure would enable further cuts.

In rich nations, the dietary changes required are ever more stark. UK and US citizens need to cut beef by 90% and milk by 60% while increasing beans and pulses between four and six times. However, the millions of people in poor nations who are undernourished need to eat a little more meat and dairy.

Reducing meat consumption might be achieved by a mix of education, taxes, subsidies for plant-based foods and changes to school and workplace menus, the scientists said.

To halt deforestation, water shortages and pollution from overuse of fertiliser, profound changes in farming practices are needed. These include increasing crop yields in poorer nations, more universal water storage and far more careful use of fertilisers.

“I was surprised by the fact we need a combination of very ambitious options,” Springmann said. “We really need to push it to the edge of what is possible.”

All the diet and farming options are already being implemented in somewhere in the world, said Springmann. In the Netherlands and Israel, fertilisers and water are being better used, while big cuts in meat consumption are being seen among young people in some cities.

But a global change is needed, he said: “I think we can do it, but we really need much more proactive governments to provide the right framework. People can make a personal difference by changing their diet, but also by knocking on the doors of their politicians and saying we need better environmental regulations – that is also very important. Do not let politicians off the hook.”

Prof Tim Benton at the University of Leeds, who was not part of the research team, said: “Ultimately, we live on a finite planet, with finite resources. It is a fiction to imagine there is a technological solution allowing us to produce as much food as we might ever want, allowing us to overeat and throw food away.” He said the environmental burden of the current food system “undermines the ability of future generations to live on a stable and ecologically rich planet”.

Prof Peter Smith at the University of Aberdeen, who was also not part of the research team, said: “We know food choices are very personal, and that behaviour change can be difficult to encourage, but the evidence is now unequivocal – we need to change our diets if we are to have a sustainable future. The fact that it will also make us healthier makes it a no-brainer.”",high,"Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",77,"This story in The Guardian covers a newly published study in the journal Nature on the environmental impacts of the food system as global population grows and diets change. The study examines possible changes including reducing the consumption of red meat (which has a large greenhouse gas and water footprint) and reducing the amount of food that spoils before it can be eaten.

The study concludes that “no single measure is enough to keep these effects within all planetary boundaries simultaneously, and that a synergistic combination of measures will be needed to sufficiently mitigate the projected increase in environmental pressures.”

This is similar to the recently released IPCC report on 1.5 °C warming, which states, “Decreasing food loss and waste and behavioural change around diets could lead to effective mitigation and adaptation options (high confidence) by reducing both emissions and pressure on land, with significant co-benefits for food security, human health and sustainable development, but evidence of successful policies to modify dietary choices remains limited.”

The scientists who examined the Guardian article mostly found that it accurately described the study’s conclusions. However, they also found that the headline was sensational and not representative of the study.

It has been shown zillions of times that reducing meat and dairy reduced climate change problems.,"Stefan Wirsenius, Associate Professor, Chalmers University of Technology","The two main headlines in The Guardian article are not supported by the content in the research paper.

First, the statement that “huge reduction in meat-eating is essential to avoid climate breakdown” is not an accurate reflection of the research findings. What the paper does say is that greenhouse gas emissions cannot be mitigated without dietary changes towards more plant-based food.

Second, the statement that “huge changes to farming are needed to avoid destroying Earth’s ability to feed its population” is a total misrepresentation of the research. The so-called “huge” changes analyzed in the paper are mainly mainstream technology improvements, such as raised yields, improved fertilizer efficiency, etc.","Margaret Gill, Professor, University of Aberdeen","The article is accurately based on the scientific publication but also includes comments from two other scientists who were not involved in the research, which strengthens its credibility. The headline just reports one of the findings though, which while accurate also plays to the alarmist rhetoric of newspaper headlines—otherwise I would have given the higher mark. The geographical distinction between UK and global citizens in the graphic is also commendable.","Hugo Valin, Research Scholar, The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis","The article provides a rigorous assessment of the overall threats to the climate and the planet, as we are getting towards the challenge of feeding a 10 billion global population. Change in diets will be required due to the high impacts of the livestock sector, but this is not the only lever to use to relieve the level of pressure, and the Nature study also heavily emphasizes the role of technical change, which is less prominent in the Guardian piece. It should also be reminded that most reductions of emissions on non-CO2 emissions from livestock will be needed in developing countries (75% of ruminant emissions, 56% of monogastrics in 2000, see Herrero et al1). Therefore, reducing consumption in rich countries will only have limited impacts if developing countries do not join the efforts. The “flexitarian” diet is also certainly a more promising way forward than a vegan diet, due to nutrition balance considerations, and cultural barriers towards stopping animal based products consumption.

The alarming tone could gain to be balanced with the diversity of challenges across different geographies, the role that technology could play to alleviate some adverse impacts, and the fact that climate mitigation in agriculture does not operate in isolation with other sector climate policies, which means the climate mitigation burden could be transferred across sectors and geographies to make the 1.5 or 2 degree C targets bearable for the food and agricultural system without jeopardizing food security2.

Guardian story conveys statement by scientists stressing role of deforestation in climate change,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-conveys-statement-scientists-stressing-role-of-deforestation-climate-change-oliver-milman/,Scientists say halting deforestation 'just as urgent' as reducing emissions,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/04/climate-change-deforestation-global-warming-report,"The role of forests in combating climate change risks being overlooked by the world’s governments, according to a group of scientists that has warned halting deforestation is “just as urgent” as eliminating the use of fossil fuels.

Razing the world’s forests would release more than 3 trillion tons of carbon dioxide, more than the amount locked in identified global reserves of oil, coal and gas. By protecting and restoring forests, the world would achieve 18% of the emissions mitigation needed by 2030 to avoid runaway climate change, the group of 40 scientists, spanning five countries, said in a statement.

“We must protect and maintain healthy forests to avoid dangerous climate change and to ensure the world’s forests continue to provide services critical for the well-being of the planet and ourselves,” the statement reads.

The intervention comes as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gathers in South Korea ahead of Monday’s release of an eagerly awaited report on how the world can avoid warming of 1.5C (2.7F) beyond pre-industrial levels, an aspirational target of the landmark Paris climate deal in 2015.

It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system, rather than forests. “In responding to the IPCC report, our message as scientists is simple: Our planet’s future climate is inextricably tied to the future of its forests,” the scientists’ statement pointedly concludes.

Trees and other vegetation currently absorb around a quarter of the CO2 humans are adding to the atmosphere, softening the potential impact of climate change.

While the world won’t lose all of its trees, large tracts of tropical forests, which hold a vast amount of carbon, are still being lost in the Amazon, central Africa and Indonesia. Warming temperatures are also fueling huge fires in forests in higher latitudes, as witnessed this summer when much of northern Sweden was aflame.

“The forest piece of the conversation is often lost and I don’t think the IPCC report will highlight it enough,” said Deborah Lawrence, a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a signatory of the statement. “We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.

“Deforestation has been massively reduced in the Amazon, but that hasn’t happened elsewhere. As countries get more peaceful in Africa we could lose more tropical forests, which really worries me.”

The IPCC’s report is expected to mention the need for as-yet unproven technology to burn vegetation and bury the resulting emissions underground or directly suck carbon from the air as a way to meet the 1.5C target.

The statement by Lawrence and other scientists warns the former strategy, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (Beccs), is untested and risks wiping out huge areas of rainforest in order to make way for plantation timber for energy.

“It breaks my heart to think we’d lose half our tropical forests for plantations just to save ourselves,” Lawrence said. “It’s horrifying that we’d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change. Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara.”

Lawrence said a steep drop in emissions to zero by 2040 would negate the need for “negative emissions” technology that would damage forests’ ability to suck up carbon, maintain local water supplies and weather patterns and provide a home for a riot of birds, mammals, insects and other creatures.

“We will have a hotter, drier world without these forests,” Lawrence said. “There needs to be an international price on carbon to fund the protection of forests. And countries with tropical forests should maintain large chunks of forests to stabilize rainfall for agriculture and keep a predictable regional climate.”

The prospects for averting at least 1.5C of warming appear dim, however, with a co-author of the upcoming IPCC report warning last week the world is “nowhere near on track” to meet its Paris commitments.","neutral, high","Accurate, Imprecise/Unclear, Unbiased",63,The article does a good job of commenting on both the singular iceberg calving event and the larger picture of ice shelf change on the Antarctic Peninsula. The authors correctly note areas where scientists disagree or do not yet know the answer.,,,,,"Ben Poulter, Research Scientist, NASA","The article correctly links estimates of current carbon dioxide emissions from land use and land cover change with fairly conservative estimates for potential carbon sequestration embedded in “natural climate solutions” as part of the climate mitigation strategy to avoid 1.5°C warming. The article highlights an independent statement (published in advance of the IPCC 1.5 degree report) raising awareness of how Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Sequestration (BECCS) activities proposed to drawdown atmospheric carbon dioxide pose negative consequences for unmanaged forests by replacing them with oil crops. The potential trade-offs of BECCS on ecosystem services provided by forests, on food security, water resources, and their effectiveness as a climate mitigation strategy are not well understood, but the risks are included in the Summary for Policymakers (SR15 SPM Final of the IPCC 1.5 degree report) published Oct 8, 2018.

Land-use and land-cover change is responsible for roughly 10-15% of total global carbon dioxide emissions. Forest management, reforestation, and afforestation where appropriate, is part of the climate mitigation portfolio assessed by Integrated Assessment Models used in the IPCC process. Trade-offs between the ecosystem services forests provide and BECCS, which requires large land area conversion to oil seed crops are limiting the scope of this strategy, and focusing attention on mitigating carbon dioxide from fossil fuel sources directly.","Devaraju Narayanappa, Postdoctoral research fellow, Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin (UVSQ-CEA-CNRS)","Overall, the article accurately conveys the main message from the world’s leading scientist signatories: “on the importance of protecting forests to avoid dangerous climate change”.

Warming beyond 2°C, say by 3 or 4°C, is bad, but not the same as “runaway” (which, in my view at least, means that warming would then take a dynamics of its own, stop responding to any emission changes and slip up to several more degrees….).",,,spanning five countries,"Going quickly through the authors I identified 7 countries: Brasil, US, France, Austria, Italy, Canada, United Kingdom (the list might not be complete).",,,,"It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system, rather than forests.",This appears to be the motivation for the authors’ statement.

It’s more complicated than that: some of the authors here are also IPCC contributors.

So it’s more a matter of nuances than opposition.",,,,"“We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.","Deforestation does happen every year, but on the whole, the latest research suggests that we are currently (over the last 30 years) slightly gaining forests globally (+7% compared to early 80’s), as forest gains outside of the Tropics, in particular in the Northern Hemisphere, are a bit greater than tropical deforestation*.

We could certainly limit deforestation to gain even more forests, though. In addition, from a carbon perspective and local climate regulation, tropical forests are probably more important than mid-/high-latitude forests.

USA Today op-ed ignores evidence to claim climate change had no role in Hurricane Florence,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/usa-today-op-ed-ignores-evidence-to-claim-climate-change-had-no-role-in-hurricane-florence-roy-spencer/,Hurricane Florence is not climate change or global warming. It's just the weather.,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/09/14/hurricane-florence-climate-change-global-warming-weather-greenhouse-flood-column/1289272002/,"Even before Hurricane Florence made landfall somewhere near the border of North and South Carolina, predicted damage from potentially catastrophic flooding from the storm was already being blamed on global warming.

Writing for NBC News, Kristina Dahl contended, “With each new storm, we are forced to question whether this is our new, climate change-fueled reality, and to ask ourselves what we can do to minimize the toll from supercharged storms.”

The theory is that tropical cyclones have slowed down in their speed by about 10 percent over the past 70 years due to a retreat of the jet stream farther north, depriving storms of steering currents and making them stall and keep raining in one location. This is what happened with Hurricane Harvey in Houston last year.

But like most claims regarding global warming, the real effect is small, probably temporary, and most likely due to natural weather patterns. Any changes in hurricanes over 70 years, even if real, can easily be part of natural cycles — or incomplete data. Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1,000 to 2,000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today. Why? No one knows.

Unusual things happen in nature sometimes
The Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635 experienced a Category 3 or 4 storm, with up to a 20-foot storm surge. While such a storm does not happen in New England anymore, it happened again there in 1675, with elderly eyewitnesses comparing it to the 1635 storm.

Until 2017, the United States went 11 years without a major hurricane strike — something that is statistically very improbable. Nine years into that 11-year hurricane drought, a NASA scientist computed it as a 1-in-177-year event. 

My point is that nature varies, and unusual things happen sometimes.

Now it’s fashionable to blame stalling hurricanes on global warming. In the case of Florence, the jet stream is indeed pushed farther north. But examination of a weather map of the atmospheric flow at an altitude of 18,000 feet shows the jet stream is pushed farther south over western North America. This kind of natural variation in atmospheric flow is called weather, not climate change. It’s just a roll of the dice. Hurricane-steering currents are subject to whatever the weather happens to be when they arrive at the U.S. coast.

No one should dismiss or minimize the damage that Florence will likely do. Hurricanes can be deadly. I completely agree with Ms. Dahl's NBC News piece that “right now, our number one priority has to be ensuring the safety of those in Florence’s evolving path, as well as the first responders helping them.”

The cost of storms has risen, not their severity
But a major hurricane hits North Carolina on average once every 20 years or so. The last was Fran in 1996, which is 22 years ago. Coastal residents know they live under a yearly threat of hurricanes, and sometimes (though relatively rarely), one of those hurricanes will be very strong.

Well, aren’t we being told these storms are getting stronger on average? The answer is no. The 30 most costly hurricanes in U.S. history (according to federal data from January) show no increase in intensity over time. The monetary cost of damages has increased dramatically in recent decades, but that is due to increasing population, wealth and the amount of vulnerable infrastructure. It’s not due to stronger storms.

If humans have any influence on hurricanes at all, it probably won’t be evident for many decades to come. Natural variability is simply too large. This should not be surprising given that humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions have caused only a1 percent change in the natural energy flows coursing through the climate system.

Roy W. Spencer, a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, is author of the Kindle e-books ""Inevitable Disaster: Why Hurricanes Can’t Be Blamed on Global Warming"" and ""Global Warming Skepticism for Busy People."" Follow him on Twitter:@RoyWSpencer ","low, very_low","Biased, Flawed reasoning, Misleading",591,"This op-ed in USA Today makes the claim that Hurricane Florence has no appreciable contribution from human-caused climate change.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that it ignores the evidence for trends in tropical cyclone behavior, including slower movement speed and more intense rainfall. Additionally, sea level rise raised the storm surge of the landfalling tropical cyclone above the level it would have reached a century ago. The article cherry-picks data in misleading way to claim that recent storms are no different from past tropical cyclones, but does not provide the analysis necessary to support this claim.

Published research on the topic does, in fact, show that climate change affects tropical cyclones like Florence. While it is unpublished and preliminary, an early analysis by researchers at Stony Brook University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggested human-induced warming could have increased Florence precipitation near its maximum by up to 50%, and more extensive research showed it contributed 15%[1] to 20%[2,3] increased rainfall for Hurricane Harvey. This is due to the fact that warmer air can hold more water vapor[4], which increases hurricanes intensity and rainfall.

Guardian story accurately covers sea ice event but makes unsupported connection to weather patterns and the Gulf Stream,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-story-accurately-covers-sea-ice-event-but-makes-unsupported-connection-weather-patterns-gulf-stream-jonathan-watts/,Arctic’s strongest sea ice breaks up for first time on record,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/21/arctics-strongest-sea-ice-breaks-up-for-first-time-on-record,"The oldest and thickest sea ice in the Arctic has started to break up, opening waters north of Greenland that are normally frozen, even in summer.

This phenomenon – which has never been recorded before – has occurred twice this year due to warm winds and a climate-change driven heatwave in the northern hemisphere.

One meteorologist described the loss of ice as “scary”. Others said it could force scientists to revise their theories about which part of the Arctic will withstand warming the longest.

The sea off the north coast of Greenland is normally so frozen that it was referred to, until recently, as “the last ice area” because it was assumed that this would be the final northern holdout against the melting effects of a hotter planet.

But abnormal temperature spikes in February and earlier this month have left it vulnerable to winds, which have pushed the ice further away from the coast than at any time since satellite records began in the 1970s.

“Almost all of the ice to the north of Greenland is quite shattered and broken up and therefore more mobile,” said Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute. “Open water off the north coast of Greenland is unusual. This area has often been called ‘the last ice area’ as it has been suggested that the last perennial sea ice in the Arctic will occur here. The events of the last week suggest that, actually, the last ice area may be further west.”

Ice to the north of Greenland is usually particularly compacted due to the Transpolar Drift Stream, one of two major weather patterns that push ice from Siberia across the Arctic to the coastline, where it packs.

Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, said: “The ice there has nowhere else to go so it piles up. On average, it’s over four metres thick and can be piled up into ridges 20 metres thick or more. This thick, compacted ice is generally not easily moved around.

“However, that was not the case this past winter (in February and March) and now. The ice is being pushed away from the coast by the winds.”

Ice is easier to blow around as a result of a warming trend, which has accelerated over the past 15 years. “The thinning is reaching even the coldest part of the Arctic with the thickest ice. So it’s a pretty dramatic indication of the transformation of the Arctic sea ice and Arctic climate.”

“Scary,” wrote Thomas Lavergne, a scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, in a retweet of a satellite-gif of the blue water penetrating white ice and exposing hundreds of miles of the Greenland coastline.

He said this would flush chunks of thicker ice out through the Fram or Nares Straits into warmer southern waters.

“I cannot tell how long this open water patch will remain open, but even if it closes in few days from now, the harm will be done: the thick old sea ice will have been pushed away from the coast, to an area where it will melt more easily,” he added.

This year’s openings are driven more by wind than melting but they have occurred during two temperature spikes. In February, the Kap Morris Jesup weather station in the region is usually below -20C, but earlier this year there were 10 days above freezing and warm winds, which unlocked the ice from the coast.

Last week, the crack opened again after Kap Morris Jesup briefly registered a record high of 17C and strong southerly winds picked up to 11 knots. Experts predict that coastal seas will freeze again but probably later than normal.

“I think that solar heating of the water column will increase during this opening and this will delay freeze-up and ice formation,” said Rasmus Tage Tonboe, a sea ice expert at the the Danish Meteorological Institute.

The latest readings by the Norwegian Ice Service show that Arctic ice cover in the Svalbard area this week is 40% below the average for this time of year since 1981. In the past month, at least 14 days in the past month have hit record lows in this region. Although thinner ice elsewhere in the Arctic means this is unlikely to be a record low year overall, they are in line with predictions that there will be no summer ice in the Arctic Ocean at some point between 2030 and 2050.

Keld Qvistgaard, the ice service coordinator in Denmark, said this was not the first time a gap had appeared between the shore and the main ice pack but the one formed from 1 to 5 August was different in its extent. “This event is a pretty big one going all the way to west of Kap Morris Jesup. This is unusual,” he said.

As well as reducing ice cover, the ocean intrusion raises concerns of feedbacks, which could tip the Earth towards a hothouse state.

Freakish Arctic temperatures have alarmed climate scientists since the beginning of the year. During the sunless winter, a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding.

This includes the Gulf Stream, which is at its weakest level in 1,600 years due to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming. With lower circulation of water and air, weather systems tend to linger longer.

A dormant hot front has been blamed for record temperatures in Lapland and forest fires in Siberia, much of Scandinavia and elsewhere in the Arctic circle.",high,"Accurate, Insightful",118,"This article in The Guardian describes unusual Arctic sea ice conditions north of Greenland, where an area normally covered by old and thick ice expected to be the last to melt due to global warming has broken up this year.

Scientist who reviewed the article found that this event was accurately discussed, but the end of the article makes questionable connections between Arctic conditions and heatwaves and fires in Europe and Siberia, as well as the Gulf Stream circulation of the Atlantic Ocean. While the relationship between Arctic sea ice conditions and midlatitude weather patterns like heatwaves is a topic of current research that is still unclear. Atlantic Ocean circulation, however, is not believed to be connected to lingering weather systems, as the article states.",,,,,"Robert Graham, Postdoc, Norwegian Polar Institute","The article is clear and accurate. The authors have consulted several experts in the field to develop this story. They provide a scientifically sound overview of the current sea ice state north of Greenland, its historical context, and what has caused this anomaly.

The reason for not providing a +2 rating relates to the second last paragraph, and statements regarding the Gulf Stream: “This includes the Gulf Stream, which is at its weakest level in 1,600 years due to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming. With lower circulation of water and air, weather systems tend to linger longer.”

It is fair to say the Gulf Stream is weakening/at its weakest in 1600 years1. However, there is no clear link between changes in the Gulf Stream and Polar Vortex or the current Arctic sea ice state. No reference is provided in the article to support such a link.

A weaker polar vortex (circulation of air) has been linked to slower moving weather systems2. However, the link between a reduced strength of the Gulf Stream (circulation of water) and slower moving weather systems is not clear. No reference is provided.

Finally, the expression “dormant hot front” is unfamiliar/unclear in the final paragraph. I think it would be better to say slower moving weather systems.

For one, we had open water develop here during February. It was likely unprecedented then, though I haven’t been able to verify this yet as I don’t have high resolution data far back in time. I do have plans to investigate this more. Anyway, since open water developed in February, this implies new ice formation, which would have been substantially thinner than the ice that had been there. Thus, having the opening happen again this summer is tied to the February event, so it is somewhat expected that it would happen again in summer. Temperatures have not been all that warm this summer in the Arctic, but if
the winds are right you can push this thinner ice away from the shore.","This statement is consistent with our many lines of evidence that sea ice has been steadily thinning. The thickest ice types have become increasingly rare. Thinner ice is more easily pushed around by the winds, so it is no surprise that the right wind patterns could move it farther offshore.",,,"“During the sunless winter, a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding.

Several studies are strongly suggesting that the loss of winter ice in the Barents Sea is the driver for a weaker polar vortex, though this remains debated in the science community.
","This statement seems to mix up some hypothesized connections among observed changes. The polar vortex did experience a disruption this past winter and likely contributed to heat waves near the North Pole, but the connection to the Gulf Stream is unclear. Increased melting of the undersides of Greenland’s outflow glaciers is fueled by warmer oceans, but there is no evidence suggesting that additional melt is causing weather systems to linger longer. Enhanced Arctic warming is believed to be causing more persistent weather patterns under certain conditions, however.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Australian publishes “deeply ill-informed” opinion on climate by Ian Plimer,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/op-ed-in-the-australian-gets-nearly-every-fact-wrong-ian-plimer/,Repeat after me: carbon dioxide is good for us,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/repeat-after-me-carbon-dioxide-is-good-for-us/news-story/3351d99047e42ab2719250ec26aa6931,"Climate policy is underpinned by two fallacies. The first is that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming. The second is that future climate can be predicted from computer models.

It has yet to be shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive climate change. More than 100 climate models over the past 30 years did not predict what actually happened because it was assumed carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds, back-radiation and the sun were trivial.

Climate projections also assume that planet Earth is not dynamic and that a temporary terrestrial vertebrate on an evolving planet can change major planetary and extraterrestrial systems.

Unless the past is understood, climate projections can be only highly speculative. Even in our own lifetimes, there is no relationship between temperature and carbon dioxide emissions by ­humans, yet there is a very close relationship between solar activity and temperature.

Since the beginning of time, water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate.

Carbon dioxide is a trace gas in the atmosphere. We are expected to believe that emission of traces of a trace gas into the atmosphere is a major planetary driving force. If the atmosphere comprised 85,000 molecules, the total carbon dioxide emissions added annually would be 33 molecules, of which only one molecule would be from human emissions and the other 32 from natural emissions. Do we really believe that one bellowing fan in a crowd of 85,000 at the MCG can completely change the course of a game?

READ MORE:Earth ‘2 degrees from hothouse’
For the past 4567 million years, the sun and the Earth’s orbit have driven climate change cycles. In the past, the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has been orders of magnitude higher than now, yet there were ice ages.

We currently live in an interglacial during an ice age with alternating cycles of glaciations and interglacials. The current interglacial reached a peak about 5000 years ago. Since then, the planet has been cooling on a millennial scale and no amount of hot air, agreements, taxes, environmental wailing or legislation can change the fact that the Earth’s orbit is slowly taking us farther from the sun.

Just 1.25 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere-ocean system has been released by ­humans in the past 250 years. The ­atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is five years and it is quickly sequestered into plants, marine life, oceans and sediments. If human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming, why have there been slight warmings and coolings since the Industrial Revolution? Why is it that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming yet natural emissions do not?

Carbon dioxide is plant food. Horticulturalists pump warm carbon dioxide into glasshouses to stimulate growth. Over the past 30 years, planet Earth has greened due to a slight increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Without carbon dioxide, there would be no complex life on earth. It is neither pollution nor a poison, and in the past the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has varied enormously.

When the atmospheric carbon dioxide content was low, plants struggled. When it was high, there was an expansion and increasing diversity of vegetation.

In addition, when it was warm, life expanded, whereas when it was cold, life contracted. Over historical times, when it was cold there was human depopulation. When it was warm, economies thrived.

Biological, geological and planetary systems are extremely robust. Our evolving dynamic planet has survived sea level changes of hundreds of metres, super volcanoes filling the atmosphere with dust, asteroid impacts, mass extinctions, ice ages and global warming. For most of time, Earth has been a warm, wet volcanic planet with no polar ice.

Australia has uranium, coal and gas for generations. Fracking for tight gas and oil could further extend energy resources. We are the envy of the world. Australia once had cheap, reliable electricity and the states competed to provide cheap, long-term, reliable energy to attract industry.

Illustration: Sturt Krygsman.
Illustration: Sturt Krygsman.
Now the states rely on the weather and compete to reach the bottom. South Australia is winning: it has the most unreliable grid in the world outside Africa and the most expensive electricity. When South Australians buy electricity at $14,200/MWh, they are paying the equivalent of $400 a litre for petrol.

As soon as the word emissions entered the language and became part of a religious ideology, electricity prices skyrocketed, electricity supply became more unreliable, subsidies for wind and solar energy went through the roof and employers and consumers had massive cost increases. Never mind that the emissions of carbon dioxide to make and maintain a wind or solar industrial complex are far greater than they will ever save.

The Paris accord is non-binding. This is recognised by the major carbon dioxide emitters such as China, India and the US, which don’t comply. No EU state has met its target. Why should Australia be the only country out of step and aim for an impossible, bankrupting reduction of 26 per cent or more of our 2005 carbon dioxide emissions?

Pragmatism and principled inaction is the correct policy to ­address the non-problem of human-induced climate change promoted by the Paris accord. But do our politicians have the courage to thoughtfully do nothing?

We are in an electricity crisis because we are trying to decrease human emissions of carbon dioxide and have tied climate policy and electricity generation costs to emissions. A reality check is needed. Even if human-induced global warming could be shown, a reduction in Australian emissions, comprising 1.3 per cent of global annual emissions, is dwarfed by annual increases of 2 per cent globally and 4 per cent by China.

Australia’s symbolic suicidal climate policy just makes everybody poorer.

We face further turnover of prime ministers and governments until the costs and reliability of electricity are addressed and until the fundamentalist religious mantra that emissions drive global warming is rejected.

Politicians need to realise that the electorate wants cheap electricity and a reduction of emissions concurrent with subsidies for unreliable weather-dependent electricity can neither reduce costs nor increase reliability.

Meanwhile, employment-generating businesses will close, household costs will become impossibly high, international competitiveness will fall and governments will change.

Emissions must be banned. From the language. Not from coal-fired power stations that have provided cheap, reliable electricity for generations. It is only then that we will have stable government and cheap reliable electricity again.

"Guardian coverage of essay on potential of future “hothouse” climate is generally accurate, but misstates some details",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/guardian-potential-future-hothouse-climate-generally-accurate-but-misstates-details-jonathan-watts/,Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state,"A domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests could tilt the Earth into a “hothouse” state beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile, a group of leading climate scientists has warned.

This grim prospect is sketched out in a journal paper that considers the combined consequences of 10 climate change processes, including the release of methane trapped in Siberian permafrost and the impact of melting ice in Greenland on the Antarctic.

The authors of the essay, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, stress their analysis is not conclusive, but warn the Paris commitment to keep warming at 2C above pre-industrial levels may not be enough to “park” the planet’s climate at a stable temperature.

They warn that the hothouse trajectory “would almost certainly flood deltaic environments, increase the risk of damage from coastal storms, and eliminate coral reefs (and all of the benefits that they provide for societies) by the end of this century or earlier.”

“I do hope we are wrong, but as scientists we have a responsibility to explore whether this is real,” said Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “We need to know now. It’s so urgent. This is one of the most existential questions in science.”

Rockström and his co-authors are among the world’s leading authorities on positive feedback loops, by which warming temperatures release new sources of greenhouse gases or destroy the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon or reflect heat.

Their new paper asks whether the planet’s temperature can stabilise at 2C or whether it will gravitate towards a more extreme state. The authors attempt to assess whether warming can be halted or whether it will tip towards a “hothouse” world that is 4C warmer than pre-industrial times and far less supportive of human life.

Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen, one of the authors, said the paper showed that climate action was not just a case of turning the knob on emissions, but of understanding how various factors interact at a global level.

“We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said. “This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”

New feedback loops are still being discovered. A separate paper published in PNAS reveals that increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions - is making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane.

Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25C, forest dieback will add 0.11C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02C. The authors of the new paper also look at the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor and the reduction of snow and ice cover at the poles.

Rockström says there are huge gaps in data and knowledge about how one process might amplify another. Contrary to the Gaia theory, which suggests the Earth has a self-righting tendency, he says the feedbacks could push the planet to a more extreme state.

As an example, the authors say the loss of Greenland ice could disrupt the Gulf Stream ocean current, which would raise sea levels and accumulate heat in the Southern Ocean, which would in turn accelerate ice loss from the east Antarctic. Concerns about this possibility were heightened earlier this year by reports that the Gulf Stream was at its weakest level in 1,600 years.

Currently, global average temperatures are just over 1C above pre-industrial levels and rising at 0.17C per decade. The Paris climate agreement set actions to keep warming limited to 1.5C-2C by the end of the century, but the authors warn more drastic action may be necessary.

“The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming,” Rockström said. “Several positive feedback loops are already in operation, but they are still weak. We need studies to show when they might cause a runaway effect.

Another climate scientist – who was not involved in the paper – emphasised the document aimed to raise questions rather than prove a theory. “It’s rather selective, but not outlandish,” said Prof Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute. “Threshold and tipping points have been discussed previously, but to state that 2C is a threshold we can’t pull back from is new, I think. I’m not sure what ‘evidence’ there is for this – or indeed whether there can be until we experience it.”

Rockström said the question needed asking. “We could end up delivering the Paris agreement and keep to 2C of warming, but then face an ugly surprise if the system starts to slip away,” he said. “We don’t say this will definitely happen. We just list all the disruptive events and come up with plausible occurrences … 50 years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried.”

“In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight,” said Dr Phil Williamson, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia. “The authors argue that we need to be much more proactive in that regard, not just ending greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible, but also building resilience in the context of complex Earth system processes that we might not fully understand until it is too late.”",high,Insightful,81,"This article in The Guardian covers an essay published by a group of scientists in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper describes previously existing research but discusses the possibility that feedbacks could commit Earth’s climate to long-term warming even if human-caused emissions ceased.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that it explained the article fairly accurately, with some subtle exceptions. The potential warming due to greenhouse gases released from permafrost, for example, is misstated as 0.9 °C—ten times the correct number of 0.09 °C. The article could also make it clearer for the reader that the essay relates to future warming that could take hundreds or even thousands of years to fully materialize.",,,,,"Andrew MacDougall, Assistant Professor, St. Francis Xavier University","The article reasonably summarizes a new study published in PNAS, which describes the potential of tipping elements to enhance climate warming and the potential for the Earth to transition into a hot-house climate state. The article is careful to point out uncertainties and thus avoids being sensational. However, there are many small errors scattered throughout the article. For example, the strength of the permafrost carbon feedback is given as 0.9 °C instead of 0.09 (0.04 to 0.16) °C. Other examples include referring to Arctic sea-ice as the “Arctic ice sheet”, and attributing the permafrost feedback to release of methane instead of primarily a release of CO2.","Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of Exeter","The two important flaws in the article are that:
1) It does not make clear that the timescales involved in these feedbacks becoming large are very long—the paper says centuries to millennia. This is compounded by a mistake in one of the numbers quoted (permafrost feedback should be 0.09 °C by 2100 according to the paper, but the article writes this as 0.9 °C).
2) The article ramps up the certainty of the scenario, using “will” where the paper uses “could” in several places.","Pepijn Bakker, Assistant professor, Department of Earth Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Netherlands","No inaccuracies and a good, balanced article with some notes on the uncertainties of the work in question, and remarks from scientists that were not involved in the paper.","Katrin Meissner, Professor, University of New South Wales",The article fairly represents the main conclusions of the PNAS paper.,"Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University","This article does a decent job reporting on a recent scientific paper. Admittedly it’s a tricky article to report on. The original article in PNAS asks the question whether a “2°C warmer” climate will actually be there if we reduce CO2 emissions enough to be in line with such a warming target according to our current understanding of the climate system and to current climate model projections. The key distinction is that IPCC projections do suggest that for some emission trajectories, global mean temperature stabilizes at +2°C.
However, certain feedback loops are not routinely accounted for in climate models yet (e.g., permafrost melting), and the time horizon of projections is usually limited to 2100 – certain feedbacks might kick in after that. So, the authors of the PNAS paper are saying: there is small possibility that +2°C is actually not stable and ultimately the system will slip away. However, there don’t really bring up any new evidence. It’s really more a discussion piece.
I think the Guardian article could have done a slightly better job conveying the level of uncertainty of the PNAS paper and explaining the difference between the PNAS authors’ conjecture and current climate model projections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state,"“Move into” makes it sound sudden, but the paper suggests that, although the feedbacks could be triggered soon and become self-perpetuating, they could take centuries to millennia to take full effect.

This is a hot, strange and dangerous summer across the planet.
Greece is in mourning after scorching heat and high winds fueled wildfires that have killed more than 80 people. Japan recorded its highest temperature in history, 106 degrees, in a heat wave that killed 65 people in a week and hospitalized 22,000, shortly after catastrophic flooding killed 200.
Ouargla, Algeria, hit 124 degrees on July 5, a likely record for the continent of Africa. And the 109-degree reading in Quriyat, Oman, on June 28 amazed meteorologists because that wasn’t the day’s high temperature. That was the low . It was the hottest low temperature ever recorded on Earth.
Montreal hit 98 degrees on July 2, its warmest temperature ever measured. Canadian health officials estimate as many as 70 people died in that heat wave.
In the United States, 35 weather stations in the past month have set new marks for warm overnight temperatures. Southern California has had record heat and widespread power outages. In Yosemite Valley, which is imperiled by wildfires, park rangers have told everyone to flee.
The brutal weather has been supercharged by human-induced climate change, scientists say. Climate models for three decades have predicted exactly what the world is seeing this summer.
And they predict that it will get hotter — and that what is a record today could someday be the norm.
“The old records belong to a world that no longer exists,” said Martin Hoerling, a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
It’s not just heat. A warming world is prone to multiple types of extreme weather — heavier downpours, stronger hurricanes, longer droughts.
“You see roads melting, airplanes not being able to take off, there’s not enough water,” said Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University. “Climate change hits us at our Achilles’ heel. In the Southwest, it’s water availability. On the Gulf Coast, it’s hurricanes. In the East, it’s flooding. It’s exacerbating the risks we already face today.”
The proximate cause of the Northern Hemisphere bake-off is the unusual behavior of the jet stream, a wavy track of west-to-east-prevailing wind at high altitude. The jet stream controls broad weather patterns, such as high-pressure and low-pressure systems. The extent of climate change’s influence on the jet stream is an intense subject of research.
This summer, the jet stream has undulated in extreme waves that have tended to block weather systems from migrating. The result has been stagnant high-pressure and low-pressure systems with dire results, such as heat waves in some places and flooding elsewhere.
“When those waves are very big — as they have been for the past few weeks — they tend to get stuck in place,” said Jennifer Francis, a professor of atmospheric science at Rutgers University. Last year, scientists published evidence that the conditions leading up to “stuck jet streams” are becoming more common, with warming in the Arctic seen as a likely culprit.
Gone are the days when scientists drew a bright line dividing weather and climate. Now researchers can examine a weather event and estimate how much climate change had to do with causing or exacerbating it.
Last year, when Hurricane Harvey broke the record for how much rain could fall from a single storm, researchers knew climate change had been a factor.
Months later, scientists presented findings that Harvey dumped at least 15 percent more rain in Houston than it would have without global warming. Theory, meet reality: When the atmosphere is warmer, it can hold more moisture. Climate change does not cause hurricanes to spin up or thunderstorms to develop, but it can be an intensifier.
In Dallas, where the temperature hit 100 on 10 out of 11 days this month, three homeless people have died of heat-related causes in the past week, said Brenda Snitzer, executive director of the Stewpot, a downtown shelter.
In Phoenix, where this week’s temperature hit 116 degrees, Dustin Nye, 36, who spent the day installing air-conditioning units, said he has suffered heat stroke in the past and still gets woozy. “It takes a special breed to do this all day long in this heat,” he said. “You’ve really got to work up your endurance and just buckle down and deal with it.”
In Los Angeles, Marty Adams, chief operating officer of the Department of Water and Power, said, “It seems like every year, we’ve had some type of temperature anomaly that we normally would not have.” Residents of beach cities such as Long Beach and Santa Monica, who normally rely on the ocean breeze to cool their homes, have added air-conditioning units, which strains the grid and has contributed to power outages, he said.
Said Hayhoe: “The biggest myth that the largest number of people have bought into is that ‘climate change doesn’t matter to me personally.’ ”
The heat waves have hit hard where people don’t expect them — the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain, Ireland and Canada.
“Our office doesn’t have air conditioning. I do have a fan,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a climate researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. He spoke by phone from the city of Gouda, where the temperature hit 96 degrees Thursday.
“This kind of event was a 1-in-100-year event in 1900,” he said. “It’s become 20 times more likely.”
It’s Britain’s driest summer since modern records began in 1961. Reservoirs are declining rapidly, and water restrictions are in effect. The United Kingdom’s national weather service urged people to avoid the sun this week, with temperatures expected to hit 98 Fahrenheit.
In Ireland, the sun-parched fields revealed a previously hidden footprint of a 5,000-year-old monument near Newgrange.
Human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, has added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, trapping heat and making extreme weather events even more extreme. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached 410 parts per million in May, the highest the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii had measured since Charles David Keeling started keeping records in 1958. NASA estimates Earth has warmed almost one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s. Of that, half a degree (around one degree F) has accrued since 1990 alone.
If nothing is done to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, scientists say, the global temperature increase could reach nine degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, with higher spikes on land and at high latitudes. The Paris agreement, signed by every country in the world, is designed to limit that temperature spike through commitments to cut greenhouse-gas emissions over time. President Trump, who in the past has called global warming a hoax, has vowed to pull the United States out of the accord as soon as that becomes possible, in 2020.
The 2017 National Climate Assessment, released in November, concluded what it has for nearly three decades: Human-made climate change is real, and the impacts have already started.
Average temperature is rising rapidly across the United States. Heat waves are becoming more extreme and will continue to do so.

Overall precipitation has decreased in the South and West and increased in the North and East. That trend will continue. The heaviest precipitation events will become more frequent and more extreme. Snowpack will continue to decline. Large wildfires will become even more frequent.
Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said even modest heat from global warming can build up over time.
“The accumulated energy over one month is equivalent to a small microwave oven at full power for six minutes over every square foot of the planet,” Trenberth said. “No wonder things catch on fire.”",very_high,Accurate,122,"This story in The Washington Post lists a variety of extreme weather events seen around the Northern Hemisphere recently.

Climate models for three decades have predicted exactly what the world is seeing this summer. And they predict that it will get hotter — and that what is a record today could someday be the norm.","Both of these statements are correct, and collectively emphasize two important points. First, the increasing frequency and intensity of heat extremes does indeed validate model-based and theoretical predictions from decades ago. Second, those same climate models suggest that what is today an extraordinary heat event could indeed become a “typical” temperature in future summers, depending on how much additional carbon society emits in the coming decades.","True. More intense and prolonged heatwaves are directly connected to global warming. Heavier precipitation events are linked with additional water vapor in the atmosphere, which results from higher air temperatures (warmer air can hold more water vapor) and greater evaporation from ocean and land. Longer, more intense droughts are also clearly connected to global warming, as higher temperatures dry out soils earlier in spring and allow them to heat up faster. Climate models have long predicted a general increase in these extremes, and now we can refine those predictions for particular types of events, regions, seasons, and varying background conditions (such as El Niño).",This is mostly correct. Regarding what models have predicted—it’s certainly the case that climate models have predicted a general increase in the frequency of heat waves as the world warms and there is a strong human influence. What is rather unique about this particular heat wave has been the spatial extent across the Northern Hemisphere. Basic statistics tells us that in a warming world the general likelihood of heatwaves coinciding at multiple locations would also increase (all else being equal). But another important piece of this puzzle is the particular jet stream configuration that also essentially acts to connect the heatwaves in multiple different regions together. An active area of research is understanding and improving how well some of these important mechanisms are represented in climate models.,,"It’s not just heat. A warming world is prone to multiple types of extreme weather — heavier downpours, stronger hurricanes, longer droughts.","There is indeed scientific evidence that each of these types of extreme events is increasing (or will increase) in a warming world.

So-called “atmospheric blocking” has occurred frequently this summer, and has historically been associated with extreme temperature and precipitation events.","Also true. Many factors affect the jet stream’s strength and path, and recent studies are revealing several mechanisms by which climate change is playing a role. This summer the jet stream has undulated far north and south, and those large waves tend to remain locked in place for weeks, causing persistent weather patterns of various sorts. It’s no coincidence that severe heatwaves have occurred simultaneously in several locations (Japan, SW U.S., Greece, Scandinavia, Alaska) together with flooding in other locations and even cooler-than-normal temperatures elsewhere.","This is an accurate reflection of where the science is at. I would point out that even if human fingerprints aren’t all over the dynamics of this event (i.e., the particular jet stream configuration) we know already that human fingerprints are all over the thermodynamics (i.e., the heatwave formed in an environment notably warmer than it would have been in the absence of human influence on the climate system).",,"Last year, scientists published evidence that the conditions leading up to “stuck jet streams” are becoming more common, with warming in the Arctic seen as a likely culprit.","There have indeed been several recent publications suggesting that certain high-amplitude jet stream patterns have been occurring more frequently in recent years. There are also some hints that this could be related to enhanced high-latitude warming, but the potential causal linkages remain the subject of considerable ongoing scientific debate. At this point, there’s not yet consensus that the Arctic is a “likely” culprit, although it certainly is a suspect.",,,,Gone are the days when scientists drew a bright line dividing weather and climate. Now researchers can examine a weather event and estimate how much climate change had to do with causing or exacerbating it.,"The field of “extreme event attribution” has indeed become much more prominent in recent years. This is a result of a combination of better modeling and analysis tools, plus a longer period of observed climate data from which to draw conclusions. While it is not possible to make these kind of attribution claims for all types of extreme weather events, it is increasingly true that this has moved from the margins to the relative mainstream of climate science.","True, but perhaps a bit optimistic. In some cases the influence of climate change on a particular weather event can be estimated fairly well, but many times the extent of attribution is difficult to pin down. That said, scientists can now state much more confidently that certain types of extreme events are more or less likely now than in pre-industrial times, and often the amount of climate-related change can be quantified (e.g. twice as likely).","This refers to event attribution (an important and growing subfield of climate science)—but it’s not always easy and there are some subtleties to this worth pointing out. Certainly, we can (and do) do this well for heatwaves, but it is still a major challenge for other types of extreme weather events today. Basically, events where the relevant physics need to be resolved at very high resolution (e.g. tornadoes and other very localized convective storms) are a major challenge for current day climate models used in these types of attribution studies. But our models are improving all the time so what is in the “hard basket” is constantly changing.",,Overall precipitation has decreased in the South and West and increased in the North and East. That trend will continue.,"This statement is overly broad. Attribution of regional mean precipitation trends is still a challenging task in most places, with some exceptions.",,,,"The heaviest precipitation events will become more frequent and more extreme. Snowpack will continue to decline. Large wildfires will become even more frequent.

NPR story accurately describes ecological consequences of altered spring timings in a warming climate,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/npr-story-accurately-describes-ecological-consequences-of-altered-spring-timings-in-a-warming-climate-nathan-rott/,"Spring Is Springing Sooner, Throwing Nature's Rhythms Out Of Whack",https://www.npr.org/2018/07/23/630181622/spring-is-springing-sooner-throwing-natures-rhythms-out-of-whack,"There's a cycle that starts when the snow melts and the earth thaws high in Colorado's Rocky Mountains. It's a seasonal cycle based on timing and temperature, two variables that climate change is pushing increasingly out of sync.

To the outsider, it can be hard to see: Plants still grow, flowers bud, bears awake, and marmots breed. Broad-tailed hummingbirds still trill around a landscape that evokes the opening scene of The Sound of Music, with flowery meadows and granite peaks.

But those who know this ecosystem will tell you something is a little off. The flowers are blooming earlier. The marmots are mating in early May. Spring is springing sooner across the Northern Hemisphere, changing natural cycles around the world.

In Alaska, brown bears are changing their feeding habits to eat elderberries that ripen earlier.

In California, birds are nesting and breeding a week earlier than they did a century ago.

""One of the consequences of climate change is that even though everything is happening earlier, they're not changing at the same rate,"" says David Inouye, an ecologist from the University of Maryland who has spent more than 40 years documenting the change in Colorado's alpine meadows.

The results can be seen all around him. Flowers are blooming before there are bees to pollinate them. Hard frosts are still occurring long after winter's snow melts away, decimating fruit orchards and budding plants. Allergy season is getting longer.

Inouye says that when he started spending his summers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic, Colo., cataloging flowers in the thin mountain air, climate change wasn't really a thing people were talking about. But as time went on, the evidence of it started to become unavoidable.

""Temperatures are getting warmer here,"" he says. ""The April low temperatures here are now about 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they used to be.""

Some plants and wildlife, taking their thermal cue, have been able to adapt in kind. Some are thriving. Others are being left behind.

Fewer flowers, fewer worker bees

Colorado's snowpack this year was the worst it had been in more than 30 years. Temperatures in early spring soared.

Many researchers here view this as a glimpse of things to come.

""You can see it visually,"" says Rebecca Irwin, an ecologist from North Carolina State University. ""We have less flowers.""

Fewer flowers means less food for the native bees that buzz around in meadows like the one Irwin stands in.

She and two others are equipped with wispy butterfly nets and fanny packs filled with plastic vials.

They're hoping to get an idea of how different bees are doing in this environment by catching as many of them as they can over the course of an hour. It is a task that proves easy.

With lunges and hops, they catch sweat bees and leafcutter bees, queens and workers.

At the end of the time period, it's clear that they caught far fewer worker bees than they would have in a normal year.

""It's hard to know if they're just delayed or if they're not doing well because there's no food for them,"" Irwin says.

Some bees, Irwin says, seem to be doing fine. In years like this, they're able to emerge earlier to meet the early bloom.

""But some of them are constrained by how long it takes them to develop,"" she says.

The fear is that those bees and the flowers that depend on them for pollination could slowly get pushed out.

Michael Stemkovski of North Carolina State says documenting these changes can be disheartening. ""It's kind of like watching an illness progress without having the tools to remedy it.""

We may not like the climate change winners

The ability of a species to adapt to its circumstances — to roll with the environmental punches, so to speak — is called plasticity.

Species that have a lot of plasticity tend to be generalists. They're able to make the situation work. Species with less plasticity, those that depend on a specific ecosystem or climate, are more likely to struggle.

""When you think of a plant that can't move over its lifetime, it either tolerates a dry area or it doesn't,"" says Dan Blumstein, a conservation biologist from the University of California, Los Angeles. He specializes in marmots, a large ground squirrel that is, in Blumstein's words, ""remarkably plastic.""

""Marmots are all about getting obese,"" Blumstein says. ""They adjust their annual schedule appropriately to be active when the vegetation is growing.""

An earlier spring means a longer growing season, so they have more time to gather food. As a result, Blumstein says, marmots seem to be getting bigger. He stops short of calling them a ""climate change winner"" though, noting that a longer growing season also means more chances for them to be killed by predators.

Other species are emerging as winners though, including ""some that people might not be very fond of,"" says Jill Anderson, a geneticist at the University of Georgia.

She points to poison ivy, which is expected to thrive with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory also report seeing far more ticks this summer than in any previous year. That report is consistent with studies showing that the range for ticks is increasing with a warming climate.

And there is a lot of evidence that climate change is diminishing biodiversity, which can be seen in these alpine meadows as well.

A glimpse of the future

Just off a ridge, in a verdant meadow, John Harte, an ecologist from the University of California, Berkeley, has created a window into the future of this place. It's a grim one.

""When I tell people what to expect, I say, 'Well, imagine the opening scene of The Sound of Music was filmed outside of Reno, Nevada,' "" he says. ""Because that's what it's going to be.""

Twenty eight years ago, Harte suspended a series of heat lamps in long, humming rows, a few feet off the ground. The lamps, which were designed for chicken farmers in Pennsylvania, raise the temperature on the ground by about 4 to 5 degrees.

""That's comparable to the climate we expect by the year 2050,"" he says.

The heat lamps have been on since then, day and night, and the change that is occurring beneath them is remarkable.

The yellow and purple flowers that dot the landscape nearby are mostly gone. In their place is sagebrush, a prolific plant that you would usually see at lower elevations.

""We are projecting that all of these meadows are going to look like that,"" Harte says, pointing to the gnarled plant. ""We are homogenizing the planet.""

There's another concern, just as great. Harte and his colleagues have found that the heated soil holds far less carbon than the native ground. That missing carbon, he says, is going into the air, creating the potential for a feedback process that will accelerate climate change further.

""Ecosystems affect climate just as much as climate affects ecosystems,"" he says. ""And the changes happen quick.""","high, very_high",Accurate,22,"This article at NPR discusses what happens when warm spring weather arrives earlier because of climate change.

USA Today story accurate but lacks clarity regarding timescales over which warming could be underestimated,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/usa-today-paleoclimate-study-mostly-accurate-lacks-clarity-doyle-rice/,"Global warming could be far worse than predicted, new study suggests",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/07/06/global-warming-double-what-models-predict-study/760748002/,"Collapsing polar ice caps, a green Sahara Desert, a 20-foot sea-level rise. 

That's the potential future of Earth, a new study suggests, noting that global warming could be twice as warm as current climate models predict.

The rate of warming is also remarkable: “The changes we see today are much faster than anything encountered in Earth’s history. In terms of rate of change, we are in uncharted waters,” said study co-author Katrin Meissner of the University of New South Wales in Australia. 

This could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe.

“Even with just 2 degrees of warming – and potentially just 1.5 degrees – significant impacts on the Earth system are profound,” said study co-author Alan Mix, a scientist from Oregon State University.

“We can expect that sea-level rise could become unstoppable for millennia, impacting much of the world’s population, infrastructure and economic activity,” Mix said.

In looking at Earth's past, scientists can predict what the future will look like. In the study, the researchers looked back at natural global warming periods over the past 3.5 million years and compared them to current man-made warming.

By combining a wide range of measurements from ice cores, sediment layers, fossil records, dating using atomic isotopes and many other established paleoclimate methods, the researchers pieced together the impact of those climatic changes.

Human-inflicted climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which release heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the the atmosphere.

Study lead author Hubertus Fischer of the University of Bern in Switzerland and his team found that our current climate predictions may underestimate long-term warming by as much as a factor of two. 

Meissner said that ""climate models appear to be trustworthy for small changes, such as for low-emission scenarios over short periods, say over the next few decades out to 2100. But as the change gets larger or more persistent ... it appears they underestimate climate change.""

The research also revealed how large areas of the polar ice caps could collapse and significant changes to ecosystems could see the Sahara Desert become green and the edges of tropical forests turn into fire-dominated savanna.

However, Meissner said ""we cannot comment on how far in the future these changes will occur.""

Referring to the study findings, lead author Fischer said that without serious reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, there is ""very little margin for error to meet the Paris targets.”

The study, which was conducted by dozens of researchers from 17 countries, was published last week in Nature Geoscience, a peer-reviewed British journal.",high,Accurate,80,"This story in USA Today covers a new study that compared past climate changes to model simulations, concluding that models can underestimate future warming over thousands of years.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that it described the study accurately. However, it implies relevance for projections of future climate change without making it clear to readers that this refers to projections far beyond the end of this century. The study does not indicate that the oft-discussed climate model projections of warming by 2100 are underestimated—an important distinction.",,,,,"Willem Huiskamp, Postdoctoral research fellow, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research","This article accurately articulates how studying past climates as an analogue for present day warming can show how we may be underestimating the long-term equilibrium temperature rise of the planet.

That’s the potential future of Earth","Although background on the underlying research is provided further down, it is important to put this information into the context of the original study to give a sense of timescale and uncertainty.

The underlying study reviews the paleoclimate record and finds periods in which the Earth’s climate may serve as an analogue for the future. The authors note that the Earth, with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and a warmer global temperatures, exhibited reductions in ice at the poles, savanna expanded into the region where the Sahara desert currently exists, and sea levels were higher. It’s important to keep in mind a few points:

drastic changes (e.g. 20-foot sea-level rise) are expected to occur over long timescales (i.e., not in our lifetime)
these past climate analogues don’t exactly match our current situation (Earth’s orbit, for example); so we should not expect that the past is a perfect predictor of the future
the magnitude of these changes does depend on human actions over the next century (i.e.., how much carbon dioxide will we emit?)",,,,global warming could be twice as warm as current climate models predict.,"The study suggests this is an upper bound. This is important, since this seems to be a factor motivating the attention-grabbing headline.

From the study: “model-based climate projections may underestimate long-term warming in response to future radiative forcing by as much as a factor of two” and “models may underestimate observed polar amplification and global mean temperatures of past warm climate states by up to a factor of two on millennial timescales”.

This “factor of two” is also derived using model simulations of large increases of CO2 (~4x pre-industrial levels) and comparing the model simulated warming to paleoclimate data from the early Eocene climatic optimum, which was roughly 50 million years ago. During this time, the Earth’s continental configuration (land mass locations and elevation) differed from the present and these continental configuration differences were not reflected in this model/paleo-data comparison. When the authors account for this, the differences between the models and the paleoclimate record appear to be substantially reduced. This “factor of two” seems to arise in part due to an apples-to-oranges comparison.

This is slightly misleading and warrants some clarification. There is a difference between the typical warming we think of with regards to IPCC targets (i.e., 2°C by 2100), which considers the next several decades and equilibrium climate sensitivity, which will take millennia to reach and involves slow processes such as ice sheet dynamics and aspects of the carbon cycle. This study deals with the latter.",,,,current climate predictions may underestimate long-term warming by as much as a factor of two,"I would have liked the article to include, specifically, the time-scale as stated in the paper. Namely, that this is only true on millennial timescales.",,,,The rate of warming is also remarkable: “The changes we see today are much faster than anything encountered in Earth’s history…”,"An example of this (over the last 65 million years) is noted in this study*.

Stifling heat cracked roads and buckled roofs across Britain last week, as Motherwell hit the highest temperature ever recorded in Scotland at 91.8°F (33.2°C). 

The heatwave has spread across the world, with Meteo France placing 21 departments across the country on an orange weather alert, while Oman saw the highest nighttime temperature ever recorded on the planet.


At least eight people have been killed by the stifling heat sweeping North America, with Montreal recording its hottest temperature since records began. 

Worse still, the stifling temperatures look set to continue across the Northern Hemisphere, meteorologists have warned.

While an isolated heatwave can be put down as an anomaly, the scale of this phenomenon points to global warming as the culprit, scientists said.

In a prolonged and unusually intense bout of sunshine, much of the Northern Hemisphere has experienced uncharacteristically warm temperatures.

The scale of this latest phenomenon suggests global warming is to blame, scientists have cautioned.

'Summers keep getting hotter,' said Friederike Otto of the University of Oxford, who conducted extensive research into data from the heatwave that spread Europe in June, July and August 2017.

'Heatwaves are far more intense than when my parents were growing up in the 1950s.

'If we do nothing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm when my young son is a grown man.' 

North America has seen a staggering rise in temperature.

There are already reports of at least eight heat-related deaths in Canada and the United States, stretching back to last weekend, including six in Montreal.

The latter broke the previous record for the city's hottest temperature, as readings from earlier this week showed it reached 97.9 °F (36.6 Celsius).

Denver, the Colorado state capital that famously resides one mile above sea level, also saw a record temperature of 105°F (40.5°C) last week.

That ties with its previous all-time record, which was set July 20 2005.

The swathe of new records are believed to be connected to the intense heat dome that has consumed most of the United States and southeast Canada since late June.

Experts expect the dome to hang over the northeast for at least another week, and predict it will spread west this weekend.

On the other side of the Atlantic ocean, climates are typically milder as a result of the cooling from the Gulf Stream.

But despite this, the summer of 2018 looks set to be one of the hottest on record.

Scotland has experienced the hottest temperature on record, with the UK Met Office reporting Motherwell, which is located some 12 miles (20 km) southeast of Glasgow, hit 91.8°F (33.2°C) on June 28.

The previous Scottish record of 91.2°F (32.9°C) was set in August 2003 at Greycrook.

Additionally, Glasgow had its hottest day on record, hitting 89.4°F (31.9°C).

Over the Irish Sea, temperatures also soared despite cooling breezes rolling off the Atlantic.

Belfast hit a new record of 85.1 degrees (29.5 Celsius) on June 28, as Castlederg in northern Ireland set a new record for the UK as a whole, topping out at 86.2°F (30.1°C) the following day.

Meteorologist Emma Salter told the Daily Express: 'High pressure over the country will slip away on Wednesday and Thursday so it will be a couple of degrees fresher, unfortunately this will be barely noticeable.

'There is another area of high pressure which will take charge later this week and temperatures will creep up towards the weekend when we could be back to 30°C.

'There will be a bit of cloud over the south which might make it feel slightly cooler but this will clear pretty rapidly.

'Then we are back to stunning blue skies and sunshine and there is no sign of this weather breaking right up until the middle of July which is unusual.

'The long-range trend is for above-average temperatures staying until the end of July with only a couple of changeable spells in this period.'

Public health England (PHE) has issued a level two health warning with regards to the unusual heat. 

It cautions: 'Temperatures are expected to temporarily reduce a little night and day through the middle of this week, before lighter winds allow higher temperatures across more eastern areas of England during Thursday and to some extent during Friday. This alert has been issued for the maximum duration possible.

'It is very likely to be extended for similar areas later this working week as heat is expected to build towards the weekend and possibly during the following week.

'Even in areas that do not breach their alert criteria, the headline is that it is expected to remain largely dry, often sunny and very warm at times.'

Experts said over the weekend that Britain's heatwave is expected to continue for at least another two weeks. 

While the islands in Western Europe smouldered in the heatwave, Eurasia was also basking in a heatwave.

Yerevan, which is located in the previously Soviet state of Armenia, saw temperatures soar to 107.6°F (42°C).

This was the country's hottest day in July, and is tied with the hottest ever day.

Russia, the host nation for the FIFA World Cup this year, is also in the midst of a heatwave.

Several spots across the south of the world's largest country either matched or exceeded their warmest June temperatures.

Quriyat, in Oman, also recorded the highest nighttime temperature ever recorded on the planet, hitting 121.6°F (49°C) on June 26, falling just two degrees short of the all-time heat record for the country, which stands at 123.4°F (50.7°C).  

The latest records come months after Pakistan posted the hottest temperature ever seen on Earth.

The sun was so intense, it took the mercury up to in excess of 120°F as it topped out at 122.4 °F (50.2°C).

Financial Post commentary misleads about warming effect of greenhouse gas emissions by cherry-picking studies,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/financial-post-commentary-misleads-warming-effect-greenhouse-gas-emissions-cherry-picking-studies-ross-mckitrick/,"Ross McKitrick: All those warming-climate predictions suddenly have a big, new problem",http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/ross-mckitrick-all-those-warming-climate-predictions-suddenly-have-a-big-new-problem,"One of the most important numbers in the world goes by the catchy title of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity, or ECS. It is a measure of how much the climate responds to greenhouse gases. More formally, it is defined as the increase, in degrees Celsius, of average temperatures around the world, after doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and allowing the atmosphere and the oceans to adjust fully to the change. The reason it’s important is that it is the ultimate justification for governmental policies to fight climate change.

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says ECS is likely between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius, but it can’t be more precise than that. Which is too bad, because an enormous amount of public policy depends on its value. People who study the impacts of global warming have found that if ECS is low — say, less than two — then the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and, in many places, mildly beneficial. If it is very low, for instance around one, it means greenhouse gas emissions are simply not worth doing anything about. But if ECS is high — say, around four degrees or more — then climate change is probably a big problem. We may not be able to stop it, but we’d better get ready to adapt to it.

So, somebody, somewhere, ought to measure ECS. As it turns out, a lot of people have been trying, and what they have found has enormous policy implications.

To understand why, we first need to delve into the methodology a bit. There are two ways scientists try to estimate ECS. The first is to use a climate model, double the modeled CO2 concentration from the pre-industrial level, and let it run until temperatures stabilize a few hundred years into the future. This approach, called the model-based method, depends for its accuracy on the validity of the climate model, and since models differ quite a bit from one another, it yields a wide range of possible answers. A well-known statistical distribution derived from modeling studies summarizes the uncertainties in this method. It shows that ECS is probably between two and 4.5 degrees, possibly as low as 1.5 but not lower, and possibly as high as nine degrees. This range of potential warming is very influential on economic analyses of the costs of climate change.

The second method is to use long-term historical data on temperatures, solar activity, carbon-dioxide emissions and atmospheric chemistry to estimate ECS using a simple statistical model derived by applying the law of conservation of energy to the planetary atmosphere. This is called the Energy Balance method. It relies on some extrapolation to satisfy the definition of ECS but has the advantage of taking account of the available data showing how the actual atmosphere has behaved over the past 150 years.

The surprising thing is that the Energy Balance estimates are very low compared to model-based estimates. The accompanying chart compares the model-based range to ECS estimates from a dozen Energy Balance studies over the past decade. Clearly these two methods give differing answers, and the question of which one is more accurate is important.

Climate modelers have put forward two explanations for the discrepancy. One is called the “emergent constraint” approach. The idea is that models yield a range of ECS values, and while we can’t measure ECS directly, the models also yield estimates of a lot of other things that we can measure (such as the reflectivity of cloud tops), so we could compare those other measures to the data, and when we do, sometimes the models with high ECS values also yield measures of secondary things that fit the data better than models with low ECS values.

This argument has been a bit of a tough sell, since the correlations involved are often weak, and it doesn’t explain why the Energy Balance results are so low.

The second approach is based on so-called “forcing efficacies,” which is the concept that climate forcings, such as greenhouse gases and aerosol pollutants, differ in their effectiveness over time and space, and if these variations are taken into account the Energy Balance sensitivity estimates may come out higher. This, too, has been a controversial suggestion.

A recent Energy Balance ECS estimate was just published in the Journal of Climate by Nicholas Lewis and Judith Curry. There are several features that make their study especially valuable. First, they rely on IPCC estimates of greenhouse gases, solar changes and other climate forcings, so they can’t be accused of putting a finger on the scale by their choice of data. Second, they take into account the efficacy issue and discuss it at length. They also take into account recent debates about how surface temperatures should or shouldn’t be measured, and how to deal with areas like the Arctic where data are sparse. Third, they compute their estimates over a variety of start and end dates to check that their ECS estimate is not dependent on the relative warming hiatus of the past two decades.

It looks like the climate models we have been using for decades need to be revised

Their ECS estimate is 1.5 degrees, with a probability range between 1.05 and 2.45 degrees. If the study was a one-time outlier we might be able to ignore it. But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases.

Policy-makers need to pay attention, because this debate directly impacts the carbon-tax discussion.

The Environmental Protection Agency uses social cost of carbon models that rely on the model-based ECS estimates. Last year, two colleagues and I published a study in which we took an earlier Lewis and Curry ECS estimate and plugged it into two of those models. The result was that the estimated economic damages of greenhouse gas emissions fell by between 40 and 80 per cent, and in the case of one model the damages had a 40 per cent probability of being negative for the next few decades — that is, they would be beneficial changes. The new Lewis and Curry ECS estimate is even lower than their old one, so if we re-did the same study we would find even lower social costs of carbon.

If ECS is as low as the Energy Balance literature suggests, it means that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and need to be revised. It also means that greenhouse gas emissions do not have as big an impact on the climate as has been claimed, and the case for costly policy measures to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions is much weaker than governments have told us. For a science that was supposedly “settled” back in the early 1990s, we sure have a lot left to learn.",low,"Cherry-picking, Misleading",199,"This opinion published by the Financial Post, written by economist Ross McKitrick, claims that Earth’s climate is much less sensitive to additions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide than climate scientists think. The article further claims that global warming is, therefore, not an important problem—and may even be beneficial.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that this argument is misleading, and relies on ignoring all but a select few of the many studies that exist on this topic. These studies use a particular method for estimating this “equilibrium climate sensitivity” that other research has shown to be problematic. An informed opinion should consider all the scientific lines of evidence available instead of picking the ones that agree with the author’s predetermined conclusion. Taken together, that evidence does not support the article’s argument.

It also glosses over the many criticisms of instrumentally based (or “energy balance”) sensitivity estimates published in recent years.","Patrick Brown, Assistant Professor, San Jose State University","The article makes a big deal about the fact that some methods of estimating equilibrium climate sensitivity tend to give smaller results than others. This is not a new finding and it is not under appreciated in the climate science literature or by the IPCC. The methods for estimating climate sensitivity discussed in the article are already incorporated into the uncertainty ranges of climate sensitivity considered by the IPCC and other assessments. Overall, it is best practice to consider results from a full range of methods and to not focus on the single method that produces the lowest estimate of climate sensitivity.","Mark Zelinka, Research Scientist, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","Rather than present the Lewis and Curry (2018) study in the context of the multitude of other estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity, the article shows only results from studies using similar approaches that confirm the claim in the title.

This body of evidence is either dismissed out of hand or ignored entirely in the article.","Andrew Dessler, Professor, Texas A&M University","This paper misrepresents that state of science.

It seems to imply that society has already decided to exactly double CO2 concentrations and has committed to emitting no further greenhouse gasses after that. If that were the case, then we could in fact assess climate change impacts in the manner done here.

However, society is far from committing to stabilizing CO2 concentrations at “only” twice their preindustrial levels. We may go well beyond that. In that case, lower equilibrium climate sensitivity just means that it takes longer to reach a given level of warming. So even if climate sensitivity turns out to be very low, all the worst impacts could still be realized—they would just be delayed.",,,,"We may not be able to stop it, but we’d better get ready to adapt to it.","The magnitude of equilibrium climate sensitivity has nothing to do with whether or not we can stop climate change.

The range that does include those effects has a median of 1.76 K (5−95%: 1.2−3.1 K). Whether this is deliberate or an oversight is hard to know, but it certainly does not add to the credibility of the piece.",,,,"But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases.","While several groups have indeed done this calculation, and they all get the same answer, these groups are basically doing versions of the same calculation with the same data. Thus, their agreement means much, much less than is suggested here. If there is a problem with the methodology, which several recently published papers have suggested, then all of them are wrong.","The text refers to a “long list of studies from independent teams“ using “a variety of methods”, but effectively they are all doing the same thing: relating forcing and ocean heat uptake to the observed warming. Dozens of other studies have demonstrated that the simple energy balance models provide climate sensitivity estimates that are too low1,2. The study by Lewis and Curry claims to account for that, but the effects could be much bigger3.

The text fails to discuss that there are literally hundreds of studies about climate sensitivity. We refer to over 400 in our review2. Taken together, they do show a substantial uncertainty range, but they do not support the “lukewarm” position. And there is no evidence that estimates of climate sensitivity have decreased recently.

McKitrick also completely ignores all the climate sensitivity evidence from studies of the Earth’s past climate changes (Paleoclimate), which broadly agrees with the equilibrium climate sensitivity range from climate models.","The text implies that one way to estimate equilibrium climate sensitivity is by using climate models, the other is by using the observed energy budget, and of course the “observed” is claimed to be better. The author fails to understand or convey that there is no way to “observe” climate sensitivity, and all estimates are using a model of some sort, and all models are constrained and evaluated by observations. The energy balance method assumes a simple energy balance framework where feedbacks are independent of timescale, forcing magnitude, and forcing type, which we know is a simplification. In addition is uses radiative forcing as an input that is model derived. It is not obvious that one method is better than the other, but it is clear that all are based on models and observations combined.",,,"Climate modelers have put forward two explanations for the discrepancy.

Rather, scientists have focused on a number of different shortcomings of instrumental-based equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates. These include using different surface temperature fields (e.g. models use air over oceans, while observations use sea surface temperatures), incomplete data (observations are missing data in much of the Arctic), timescales of feedbacks (instrumental climate sensitivity estimates assume inferred feedbacks over the past few decades remain constant over time, while models show greater feedback magnitudes in the future than in the past), and many other issues.

Washington Post article accurately describes latest estimate of accelerating Antarctic ice loss,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-article-accurately-describes-latest-estimate-accelerating-antarctic-ice-loss-chris-mooney/,"Antarctic ice loss has tripled in a decade. If that continues, we are in serious trouble.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/06/13/antarctic-ice-loss-has-tripled-in-a-decade-if-that-continues-we-are-in-serious-trouble/,"Antarctica’s ice sheet is melting at a rapidly increasing rate, now pouring more than 200 billion tons of ice into the ocean annually and raising sea levels a half-millimeter every year, a team of 80 scientists reported Wednesday.
The melt rate has tripled in the past decade, the study concluded. If the acceleration continues, some of scientists’ worst fears about rising oceans could be realized, leaving low-lying cities and communities with less time to prepare than they had hoped.
The result also reinforces that nations have a short window — perhaps no more than a decade — to cut greenhouse-gas emissions if they hope to avert some of the worst consequences of climate change.
Antarctica, the planet’s largest ice sheet, lost 219 billion tons of ice annually from 2012 through 2017 — approximately triple the 73 billion-ton melt rate of a decade ago, the scientists concluded. From 1992 through 1997, Antarctica lost 49 billion tons of ice annually.
The study is the product of a large group of Antarctic experts who collectively reviewed 24 recent measurements of Antarctic ice loss, reconciling their differences to produce the most definitive figures yet on changes in Antarctica. Their results — known formally as the “Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-Comparison Exercise” (IMBIE) — were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.
“We took all the estimates across all the different techniques, and we got this consensus,” said Isabella Velicogna, an Antarctic expert at the University of California at Irvine and one of the many authors from institutions in 14 countries. The lead authors was Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds in England and Erik Ivins of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
“The detailed record shows an acceleration, starting around 2002,” Beata Csatho, one of the study authors and a glaciologist at the University at Buffalo, said in an email.

Csatho noted that comparing the first and last five-year periods in the record reveals an even steeper acceleration. “Actually, if you compare 1997-2002 to 2012-2017, the increase is even larger, a factor of more than 5!!” she wrote.
For the total period from 1992 through the present, the ice sheet has lost nearly 3 trillion tons of ice, equating to just less than 8 millimeters of sea-level rise. Forty percent of that loss has occurred in the past five years.
The rapid, recent changes are almost entirely driven by the West Antarctic ice sheet, which scientists have long viewed as an Achilles’ heel. It is known to be losing ice rapidly because it is being melted from below by warm ocean waters, a process that is rendering its largest glaciers unstable.
West Antarctica lost 159 billion tons of ice a year from 2012 through 2017, compared with 65 billion tons from 2002 through 2007.
The growth is largely attributable to just two huge glaciers: Pine Island and Thwaites. The latter is increasingly being viewed as posing a potential planetary emergency because of its enormous size and its role as a gateway that could allow the ocean to someday access the entirety of West Antarctica, turning the marine-based ice sheet into a new sea.
Pine Island is now losing about 45 billion tons per year, and Thwaites is losing 50 billion. Both numbers are higher than the annual losses for any other glacier in the world.
“The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,” said Christine Dow, a glaciologist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario who was not involved in the research. “And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.”
“If you start removing mass from there, you can have a very large-scale evacuation of ice into the ocean and significant sea-level rise,” Dow said.
Dow is the lead author of a just-published study outlining one process that could be driving, and could worsen, some of Antarctica’s ice losses.
She and her co-authors found that at numerous major glaciers including Pine Island, warm ocean waters are helping to carve out deep crevasses underneath the floating ice shelves that brace these glaciers in place. The shelves then tend to crack at these thinned-out points and break off large pieces, weakening their ability to hold back the flow of glacial ice into the ocean.
“Anywhere you have thinner ice, it’s going to be weaker,” Dow said.
In addition to West Antarctica, another increase in ice losses in the past decade came from the smaller glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula, which are also melting rapidly but contain less potential to raise the sea level.
The largest part of the continent, East Antarctica, has remained more stable and did not contribute much melt to the ocean during the period of study, the assessment says. However, in the past five years, it too has begun to lose ice, perhaps as much as 28 billion tons per year, although the uncertainty surrounding this number remains high.
What’s happening in East Antarctica is important because it has, by far, the most ice to give, being capable of raising sea levels by well over 100 feet. A single East Antarctic glacier, Totten, has the potential to unleash as much total sea-level rise as the entire West Antarctic ice sheet, or more.
“We cannot count on East Antarctica to be the quiet player, and we start to observe change there in some sectors that have potential, and they’re vulnerable,” Velicogna said.
Scientists have previously raised fears about a scenario in which ice loss from Antarctica takes on an explosive rate.
In a controversial 2016 study, former NASA scientist James Hansen and a team of colleagues, including Velicogna, found that Earth’s sea level could rise above one meter (or 3.3 feet) within 50 years if polar ice-sheet loss doubles every 10 years. A tripling every decade, were it to continue, would reach that volume of sea level rise even sooner.
There is no proof the current rate of change in Antarctica will continue. Scientists can’t see the future, but they do fear continuing and even worsening losses.
“I don’t know if it’s going to keep exactly tripling, but I think it has a lot of potential to keep significantly increasing,” Velicogna said.
The changes will not be steady, in any case, said Knut Christianson, an Antarctic researcher at the University of Washington. “We will not necessarily see solely rapid retreat,” Christianson in an email, noting that as glaciers such as Pine Island retreat down a submarine, downhill slope, they will sometimes encounter bumps that slow their movement. So we should expect “periods of stability interspersed with rapid retreat,” he said.
Under high greenhouse-gas emissions, the worst-case projections of sea-level rise eventually reach over a centimeter each year, said Rob DeConto, an Antarctic expert at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who was not involved in the new study.
We’re nowhere near that point yet.
“We’re still talking about roughly a half a millimeter per year,” DeConto said. “That isn’t going to sound horribly unmanageable. But remember for the Northern Hemisphere, for North America, the fact that the location in West Antarctica is where the action is amplifies that rate of sea-level rise by up to about an additional 25 percent in a city like Boston or New York.”
That’s because as Antarctica’s mass shrinks, the ice sheet’s gravitational pull on the ocean relaxes somewhat, and the seas travel back across the globe to pile up far away — with U.S. coasts being one prime destination.
Whether Antarctic mass loss keeps worsening depends on choices made today, argued DeConto, who co-authored a separate paper in this week’s Nature outlining two visions of Antarctica in 2070.
Continuing high emissions could deliver massive sea-level rise — but strong compliance with the Paris climate agreement, while unable to stop changes happening now, could help to control how much they worsen.
“The kinds of changes that we see today, if they were not to increase much more . . . then maybe we’re talking about something that is manageable for coastal stakeholders,” DeConto said.
Or alternatively, he continued, Antarctica could drive faster changes, ones that “begin to exceed what we’re going to be able to cope with.”",high,"Accurate, Insightful",93,"This article in The Washington Post describes an important study from a project called the Ice sheet Mass Balance Intercomparison Exercise (or IMBIE), which synthesized many existing records of Antarctic ice based on different types of measurements. The resulting estimate shows that Antarctica alone lost enough ice between 1992 and 2017 to raise global sea level by around 7.6 millimeters—almost 10% of the total sea level change over that time period.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that it accurately summarized this result, while explaining some of the processes behind this mass loss and the sea level rise it produces. However, they note that future trends depend partly on complex natural variability, which the article could have made clear.

","If these numbers seem abstract, consider this: Much of the ice mass loss is focused along the Amundsen Sea coast of West Antarctica. This is essentially the Pacific Coast of West Antarctica, which is roughly the same length as the Pacific Coast of the United States (~1200 miles, 1900 kilometers). The two Pacific Coasts—of the USA and the Antarctic—are overlain in this NASA image:

Basically, this entire Pacific coast of West Antarctica is where Antarctic ice mass loss comes from, as can be seen in this animation of GRACE satellite gravity measurements from 2002-2016 which were part of the IMBIE study.

In this illustration you can also see a “hot-spot” of mass loss on the left side of the Antarctic map, where Totten Glacier drains a portion of the East Antarctic ice sheet that is also increasingly losing mass.",,,,"“Antarctica, the planet’s largest ice sheet, lost 219 billion tons of ice annually from 2012 through 2017 — approximately triple the 73 billion ton melt rate of a decade ago, the scientists concluded. From 1992 through 1997, Antarctica lost 49 billion tons of ice annually.”",This is a correct summary of the results from the study.,"This translates to about 0.6 mm/yr in 2012-2017, while the 1992-1997 rates were 0.14 mm/yr. This may not sound like much, but the current total rate of sea-level rise is around 3.2 mm/yr, so Antarctica is responsible for an increasingly large portion of the observed sea-level rise.",,,"“The study is the product of a large group of Antarctic experts who collectively reviewed 24 recent measurements of Antarctic ice loss, reconciling their differences to produce the most definitive figures yet on changes in Antarctica.”","This sounds like there are only 24 data points, but the data going into the analysis is much more extensive than this, encompassing 24 types of measurements and analysis methodologies for the period from 1992 through to 2017.",,,,“Whether Antarctic mass loss keeps worsening depends on choices made today”,"This is the biggest opportunity to add more depth to the analysis of this new Antarctic ice loss result. An important point here is that the human fingerprint on this Antarctic mass loss is still hard to identify. A 2013 assessment1 showed that expert opinion is “uncertain and undecided” about whether recent ice sheet behavior simply reflects natural variability or is a response to human-caused climate change. This is essentially because our observations of ice sheet behavior are too short, 30 years at best for satellite observations of the ice sheet. This just meets the minimum definition of a “climatology” with respect to the atmosphere, and we know that the ice sheet operates on longer timescales than the atmosphere (it is a big system to move!).

Although West Antarctica has been one of the fastest-warming places on the planet over the last 60 years (sparse weather records begin in 1957), as Steig et al showed in 20092 and Bromwich et al confirmed in 20133, how/whether this atmospheric warming has emerged from natural climate variability is less clear. It is also unclear how this warming trend will continue, as climate in West Antarctica is pushed around by Pacific Ocean-atmosphere variability. From ice core records we (myself and MANY others) have drilled and analyzed across this region we do not see recent anomalies exceeding variability over the last 2000 years4. From measurements of ice borehole temperatures in the same region, the ice itself directly records anomalous warmth over the last 50 years5.

Antarctic weather is known to be harsh but it is also some of the most variable on the planet. The human fingerprint of atmospheric warming has emerged everywhere else on the planet as early as about 200 years ago, but we are still waiting for it to clearly emerge in Antarctica (see Figure 2 in Abram et al, 20166). As Mooney explains, how much atmospheric warming comes to Antarctica largely depends on our carbon emission choices in the near-term.

In addition to all of this, the ice loss in West Antarctica is less driven by ocean warming as it is by increased delivery of relatively-warm deep ocean currents beneath ice shelves. This delivery is driven by the atmosphere; whether winds blow strong enough in the right direction to drive upwelling currents beneath Pacific-facing West Antarctic ice shelves. Decadal-scale variability of the Pacific Ocean-atmosphere system in turn affect the strength and position of these current-driving winds.

Summary: it’s very complicated but the Pacific Ocean is the beast to watch for future West Antarctic ice loss, in combination with the dynamics of Pine Island, Thwaites, and a few smaller glaciers (Smith, Kohler) along the Amundsen Sea coast of West Antarctica.

Rather, it is variability in the delivery of this relatively warm water (called Circumpolar Deep Water) that can directly affect how much melt is happening. Delivery of this water is altered by the direction and strength of winds over the Amundsen Sea, a subset of the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. If winds blow from west to east across the Amundsen Sea, they promote upwelling of this deep water under ice shelves, promoting melt and hence increasing ice loss*.

But remember for the northern hemisphere, for North America, the fact that the location in West Antarctica is where the action is amplifies that rate of sea level rise by up to an about additional 25 percent in a city like Boston or New York.’ That’s because as Antarctica’s mass shrinks, the ice sheet’s gravitational pull on the ocean relaxes somewhat, and the seas travel back across the globe to pile up far away — with U.S. coasts being one prime destination.”","What Rob DeConto and Chris Mooney explain here are the “far-field” sea level rise effects of losing so much concentrated ice mass in West Antarctica. This loss of mass reduces the gravitational pull that Antarctica otherwise has on the ocean, causing more water to slosh away from the far South. This just so happens to have a maximum impact on both coasts of North America, as illustrated in the Climate Science Special Report released in 2017 as part of the 4th National Climate Assessment undertaken by US federal agencies and universities. Figure 12.1 in the Sea Level Rise chapter shows that an extra 1.4 feet per century of relative sea level rise can be expected for North America (data originally from Kopp et al*), coming largely from the two largest West Antarctic glaciers—Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers.

","This effect is called the gravitational effect, and it is the consequence of one of the basic laws of physics: mass attracts mass. When mass is lost on Antarctica, sea level will fall within a 2,200 km radius due to the loss of gravitational pull. Between 2,200 and 7,600 km, sea level will rise but less than the global average. Beyond 7,600 km, sea level rise will be larger than the global mean, up to 25% extra. For Antarctica, this means that the largest consequences will be in the Northern Hemisphere, with the reverse being true for mass loss in Greenland.

The gravitational effect has been known since 18861, was rediscovered in 19762 and again in 20013. It is used in sea-level projections, for instance in the IPCC AR5 report, chapter 13.

National Geographic accurately covers research pointing to slower-moving hurricanes,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/national-geographic-hurricanes-moving-slower-global-warming-craig-welch/,Hurricanes Are Moving Slower—And That's a Huge Problem,https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/06/hurricanes-cyclones-move-slower-drop-more-rain-climate-change-science/,"Tropical cyclones, including hurricanes and typhoons, are now crawling across the planet at a slower pace than they did decades ago, dragging out and amplifying their devastation, new research published Wednesday shows.

At the same time, related research published just last month suggests that warming temperatures from climate change will slow storms more in the future.

While having a cyclone travel with less speed may seem like a good thing, it's actually just the opposite. Wind speeds within the storm remain high, but the whole system itself moves slower across the landscape, allowing punishing rains to linger longer over communities.

Taken together, these two studies suggest that climate change is already increasing the dangers posed by hurricanes and typhoons in far more ways than previously thought, and it will continue to compound many of the hazards, especially the threat of severe flooding.

""Nothing good comes out of a slowing storm,"" says James Kossin, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Center for Weather and Climate in Madison, Wisconsin, and author of the first paper, published today in the journal Nature. ""It can increase storm surge. It can increase the amount of time that structures are subjected to strong wind. And it increases rainfall.""

Driving Devastation
In the wake of Hurricane Harvey's torrential rains, which dumped several feet of water on sections of Houston, Texas, last August, scientists showed that warmer sea and air temperatures pumped more moisture into the storm—which then fell as rain. Climate change increased both the intensity of the rainfall and the likelihood that the storm would occur.

13 Photos of Extreme Weather
In his paper, Kossin found yet another way changes in storm patterns are sparking greater devastation. He showed that from 1949 to 2016, tropical cyclones across the globe slowed their movement by 10 percent on average. In some regions, the pace of those storms slowed even more as they hit land. In the western North Pacific, the decline was almost a third. That means a storm that may already hold more moisture will have time to drop more of it in each spot.

With the exception of the Indian Ocean region, which tends to behave differently, ""all the other regions show this consistent slowing,"" Kossin says. ""The trend is always in one direction.""

Kossin's work was based on details of almost 70 years' worth of storms, but he made no attempt to determine what was causing the slowdown. Still, the shift is precisely what he and other cyclone experts said would be expected from climate change. With polar regions warming faster than other parts of the globe, that is altering pressure gradients, reducing the winds that push these storms.

""Tropical cyclones are just carried along by the wind, so it makes sense,"" Kossin says. ""The storms will stay in your neighborhoods longer.""

Christina Patricola, a scientist with the climate and ecosystem sciences division of California's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, called Kossin's work ""important and new"" and says she found it ""pretty convincing.""

""I was not surprised by his findings,"" she says. ""But I was surprised by the magnitude of the slowdown.""

In an editorial accompanying Kossin's work, she points out that it raises several new questions. For instance, if exceptionally slow-moving storms have grown more likely in recent years, does that mean ""stalled"" storms like Harvey—which seemed to get stuck in place for days—are increasing, too?

Kossi hopes that scientists will begin building models that show which communities are likely to face the most risk. Given that storms in some regions are migrating poleward and already increasing in intensity, cyclones delivering unusually powerful bouts of rain may threaten places not normally in their path. ""These are not good things to be combining,"" he says.

Increasing Flooding?
In the second study, published in the Journal of Climate, a team led by Ethan Gutmann, with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, tried to see how 22 hurricanes that hit in the last 13 years might be different if they hit in the future under a warmer climate.

By plugging storm data into computer models representing a future with temperatures that are up to five degrees warmer, they found that these cyclones moved 9 percent slower and were far, far wetter. Rainfall, on average, increased 24 percent.

""We're showing that it not only slows down, but that it's more intense,"" Gutmann says. ""That has serious implications for inland flooding and urban infrastructure.""

Gutmann and Kossin took entirely different approaches—one looking at historical data; the other using modeling to see how storms would behave under predicted warming scenarios. And there are limits to each approach. No storm from today will reproduce in quite the same way in the future.

But both scientists say the importance is in the bigger picture. The fact that their results show quite similar trends should be a wake-up call.

""We're both pushing the work forward and adding additional lines of evidence,"" Gutmann says. ""And when you start getting more and more lines of evidence that all point in the same direction, you get more confident in the answers."" ",very_high,"Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",96,"This National Geographic article covers a result reported in two recent studies: global warming seems to be causing the movement rate of hurricanes to slow. One study shows this trend in data going back to about 1950, while the other simulates hurricanes in an even warmer world using a climate model. While the process responsible for this trend needs to be studied further, it could be due to a general slowing of winds in areas where hurricanes exist due to differences in warming rate between low and high latitudes.

Scientists who reviewed the article concluded that it does a good job of placing the finding in context and asking input from scientists with expertise on the topic for validation.
",,,,,"Dan Chavas, Assistant Professor, Purdue University","This is an important topic and the article explains the new research findings clearly and in terms that can be understood by laypeople. Highlighting how this result about slowing storms is consistent across two studies that employ very different methodologies further helps convey to the public how we try to use multiple lines of evidence to understand how our world works and how it may chance in the future.
","Kerry Emanuel, Professor of Atmospheric Science, MIT",The story accurately conveys the essence of the original paper by James Kossin.,"Emmanuel M Vincent, Research Scientist, University of California, Merced: Emmanuel Vincent, Research Scientist, Editor, Science Feedback","The National Geographic article covers two new scientific studies that provide evidence that ongoing global warming is decreasing the translation speed of hurricanes. One study shows a 10% reduction in observed translation speed between 1949 and 2016 while the second finds a ~10% reduction in translation speed of two dozen hurricanes simulated in a warmer future by the end of the 21st century. The fact that two independent studies using different approaches corroborate the finding increases the confidence one can have in this surprising result, even though it remains to be validated further.

The article correctly emphasizes a more strongly established scientific result: that hurricanes drive significantly more rainfall in a warmer climate, which is a major aspect of their destructiveness.
","Karthik Balaguru, Scientist, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","The findings from the study are consistent with the idea of a slowdown of the Hadley circulation in response to global warming. However, it’ll be interesting to see if similar trends are obtained when using hurricane track data over the satellite period, when the data is more accurate. One of the main points of the article is that the slowdown of hurricanes is occurring over land, which can certainly have serious implications. But over the ocean, which has roughly 90% of the data, the impacts of a slowdown are not entirely clear to me. For instance, it is known that slower hurricanes create a stronger cold wake and hence become more susceptible to ocean feedback. How this may influence the intensity of the storms needs careful evaluation.

New York Times story accurately describes Rio Grande’s climate context,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-story-accurately-describes-rio-grandes-climate-context-henry-fountain/,"In a Warming West, the Rio Grande Is Drying Up",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/24/climate/dry-rio-grande.html,"Mario Rosales, who farms 365 acres along the Rio Grande, knows the river is in bad shape this year. It has already dried to a dusty ribbon of sand in some parts, and most of the water that does flow is diverted to irrigate crops, including Mr. Rosales’s fields of wheat, oats, alfalfa and New Mexico’s beloved chiles.

Because last winter’s mountain snowpack was the second-lowest on record, even that irrigation water may run out at the end of July, three months earlier than usual. But Mr. Rosales isn’t worried. He is sure that the summer thunderstorms, known here as the monsoon, will come.

“Sooner or later, we’ll get the water,” he said.

The monsoon rains he is counting on are notoriously unpredictable, however. So he and many of the other farmers who work 62,000 acres along 140 miles of the Rio Grande in central New Mexico may get by — or they may not.

“Nobody’s got a whole lot of water,” said David Gensler, the hydrologist for the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, whose job is to manage the river water that is delivered to Mr. Rosales and the others through diversion dams, canals and ditches. “If we use it up early in the season and don’t get any rain further on, the whole thing’s going to crash.”

Parts of the state got some much-needed rain this week, which may help Mr. Gensler extend his irrigation water a bit. But whatever happens this spring and summer, the long-term outlook for the river is clouded by climate change.

This image, taken on May 17, shows a stretch of the river that is expected to dry earlier than usual because of reduced water flow and diversion for irrigation.

As the river dries, crews rescue endangered minnows from remaining pools of water.

The Rio Grande is a classic “feast or famine” river, with a dry year or two typically followed by a couple of wet years that allow for recovery. If warming temperatures brought on by greenhouse gas emissions make wet years less wet and dry years even drier, as scientists anticipate, year-to-year recovery will become more difficult.

“The effect of long-term warming is to make it harder to count on snowmelt runoff in wet times,” said David S. Gutzler, a climate scientist at the University of New Mexico. “And it makes the dry times much harder than they used to be.”

With spring runoff about one-sixth of average and more than 90 percent of New Mexico in severe to exceptional drought, conditions here are extreme. Even in wetter years long stretches of the riverbed eventually dry as water is diverted to farmers, but this year the drying began a couple of months earlier than usual. Some people are concerned that it may dry as far as Albuquerque, 75 miles north.

But the state of the Rio Grande reflects a broader trend in the West, where warming temperatures are reducing snowpack and river flows.

A study last year of the Colorado River, which provides water to 40 million people and is far bigger than the Rio Grande, found that flows from 2000 to 2014 were nearly 20 percent below the 20th century average, with about a third of the reduction attributable to human-caused warming. The study suggested that if climate change continued unabated, human-induced warming could eventually reduce Colorado flows by at least an additional one-third this century.

“Both of these rivers are poster children for what climate change is doing to the Southwest,” said Jonathan T. Overpeck, dean of the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan and an author of the Colorado study.

While both the Colorado and the Rio Grande are affected by warming, Dr. Overpeck said, the Rio Grande has also been hurt by declines in winter precipitation. “It’s a one-two punch,” he said.

Last year, though, was a wet one on the Rio Grande, with a strong snowpack in the winter of 2016-17 that allowed the conservancy district to store water in upstream reservoirs. Using that water now should help Mr. Gensler keep the irrigation taps turned for several months.

“In some ways I’m more concerned about 2019 than 2018,” he said. “There’s a possibility we’re going to drain every drop this year, and go into next year with nothing.”

Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century. As elsewhere in the West, warmer temperatures in winter mean that more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow in the San Juan and Sangre de Cristo mountains that feed the Rio Grande.

Dr. Gutzler said spring temperatures have an impact, too, with warmer air causing more snow to turn to vapor and essentially disappear. A longer and warmer growing season also has an effect, Dr. Overpeck said, as plants take up more water, further reducing stream flows.

Running for nearly 1,900 miles, mostly through arid lands, the Rio Grande is one of the longest rivers in the United States. It is also one of the most managed, having been controlled by dams and other structures for most of the last century. But use of the river for irrigation dates back much further: For hundreds of years its water nourished the crops of native Puebloan people and Spanish colonizers.

In a typical year most water in the upper Rio Grande is diverted for irrigation. (Albuquerque, by far the state’s largest city, gets its drinking water from groundwater wells and from a project that diverts water from the Colorado River basin through a tunnel under the Continental Divide.)

By law, some Rio Grande water must also be sent further downstream, to a reservoir that serves farmers in southern New Mexico and Texas. That section of the river, which forms the border with Mexico and empties into the Gulf of Mexico, has its own severe problems, and relies on a Mexican tributary for most of its water.

As the river dries, crews from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service spring into action, working to rescue the Rio Grande silvery minnow, a federally protected endangered species that used to thrive along the full length of the river but now is found only in the upper reaches.

Crews have been rescuing the small fish most springs and summers for about 20 years, running nets through pools that remain as the river dries up and delivering the fish to wetter areas upstream.

Normally the crews would start this work in June, said Thomas P. Archdeacon, a Fish and Wildlife biologist who heads the minnow rescue operation. This year, he said, they made their first rescue on April 2 and have moved northward as stretches of the river dried up.

“I look at it as an umbrella species,” he said of the minnow. “Because it has these federal protections, it’s protecting basically everything along the river.” The Rio Grande is still lined with willows, Russian olive and other vegetation along its banks, and together with the irrigated farmland forms a long, narrow oasis amid an otherwise parched brown landscape.

But much of the riverbed itself is as dry as a bone.

Mr. Archdeacon had driven an all-terrain vehicle up the sandy riverbed from the town of San Antonio, reaching a spot about three miles north where the flowing river petered out into damp sand. This was what remained of the water allowed through a dam in San Acacia, about 20 miles to the north, the rest being diverted for irrigation.

Mr. Rosales will be benefiting from that diverted water, and if the monsoon rains come he may well produce a plentiful crop of chiles in late summer and fall for his wife, Linda, to roast and sell at a nearby produce stand.

“We’ve got a lot of faith,” he said. “We’ve always worked on faith.”

Others may not have to hope for rain. Chris Sichler, who farms 650 acres near San Antonio, has wells to pump groundwater onto his fields should the irrigation canals dry up and the rains not materialize. “I’m droughtproof,” he said. “When we plant in the spring we don’t even take into consideration how much snowpack or surface water there’s going to be.”

North of Albuquerque, Derrick J. Lente, a member of the Sandia Pueblo, cultivates 150 acres, some of which is pasturage for cows that he raises. Under water laws, farmers in the pueblos would be among the last to lose water.

His ancestors have farmed in this region for hundreds of years, through wet times and dry. But Mr. Lente, who is also a state legislator, recognizes that there is long-term trouble ahead. His father and uncles, who have been farming far longer than him, have seen changes.

“This is the worst they’ve seen it in their lives,” he said. “The times are changing to where it’s hotter.”

Mr. Lente does not have irrigation wells on his farm, but he has made improvements to conserve water, lining some of his irrigation ditches and replacing another with a tunnel.

“I never built it with the idea we won’t ever have water,” he said. “I don’t want to think of that time, I really don’t. We’d have to make some hard decisions.”",high,Sound reasoning,44,"This article in The New York Times discusses water supply issues along the Rio Grande in New Mexico, and the projected impacts of climate change.

Wall Street Journal commentary grossly misleads readers about science of sea level rise,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-commentary-grossly-misleads-readers-about-science-of-sea-level-rise-fred-singer/,"The Sea Is Rising, but Not Because of Climate Change",https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-sea-is-rising-but-not-because-of-climate-change-1526423254,"Of all known and imagined consequences of climate change, many people fear sea-level rise most. But efforts to determine what causes seas to rise are marred by poor data and disagreements about methodology. The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an “enigma”; it has also been called a riddle and a puzzle.

It is generally thought that sea-level rise accelerates mainly by thermal expansion of sea water, the so-called steric component. But by studying a very short time interval, it is possible to sidestep most of the complications, like “isostatic adjustment” of the shoreline (as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted) and “subsidence” of the shoreline (as ground water and minerals are extracted).

I chose to assess the sea-level trend from 1915-45, when a genuine, independently confirmed warming of approximately 0.5 degree Celsius occurred. I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming; it continues at the same rate, 1.8 millimeters a year, according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr. I therefore conclude—contrary to the general wisdom—that the temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea-level rise. That means neither does the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide.

This conclusion is worth highlighting: It shows that sea-level rise does not depend on the use of fossil fuels. The evidence should allay fear that the release of additional CO2 will increase sea-level rise.

But there is also good data showing sea levels are in fact rising at a constant rate. The trend has been measured by a network of tidal gauges, many of which have been collecting data for over a century.

The cause of the trend is a puzzle. Physics demands that water expand as its temperature increases. But to keep the rate of rise constant, as observed, expansion of sea water evidently must be offset by something else. What could that be? I conclude that it must be ice accumulation, through evaporation of ocean water, and subsequent precipitation turning into ice. Evidence suggests that accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect for at least several centuries.

It is difficult to explain why evaporation of seawater produces approximately 100% cancellation of expansion. My method of analysis considers two related physical phenomena: thermal expansion of water and evaporation of water molecules. But if evaporation offsets thermal expansion, the net effect is of course close to zero. What then is the real cause of sea-level rise of 1 to 2 millimeters a year?

Melting of glaciers and ice sheets adds water to the ocean and causes sea levels to rise. (Recall though that the melting of floating sea ice adds no water to the oceans, and hence does not affect the sea level.) After the rapid melting away of northern ice sheets, the slow melting of Antarctic ice at the periphery of the continent may be the main cause of current sea-level rise.

All this, because it is much warmer now than 12,000 years ago, at the end of the most recent glaciation. Yet there is little heat available in the Antarctic to support melting.

We can see melting happening right now at the Ross Ice Shelf of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Geologists have tracked Ross’s slow disappearance, and glaciologist Robert Bindschadler predicts the ice shelf will melt completely within about 7,000 years, gradually raising the sea level as it goes.

Of course, a lot can happen in 7,000 years. The onset of a new glaciation could cause the sea level to stop rising. It could even fall 400 feet, to the level at the last glaciation maximum 18,000 years ago.

Currently, sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2. We can expect the sea to continue rising at about the present rate for the foreseeable future. By 2100 the seas will rise another 6 inches or so—a far cry from Al Gore’s alarming numbers. There is nothing we can do about rising sea levels in the meantime. We’d better build dikes and sea walls a little bit higher.",very_low,"Biased, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",4477,"This commentary published by The Wall Street Journal, written by Fred Singer, claims that warming (and therefore greenhouse gas emissions) has no effect on global sea level rise. Although Singer concedes the physical fact that water expands as its temperature increases, he claims that this process must be offset by growth of Antarctic ice sheets.

Scientists who reviewed this opinion piece explained that it is contradicted by a wealth of data and research. Singer bases his conclusion entirely on a cherry-picked comparison of sea level rise 1915-1945 and a single study published in 1990, claiming a lack of accelerating sea level rise despite continued warming. But in fact, modern research utilizing all available data clearly indicates that sea level rise has accelerated, and is unambiguously the result of human-caused global warming.

Since the 1990s for example, satellites have measured an acceleration in the rate of global sea level rise:",,,,,"Chris Roberts, Research Scientist, ECMWF/Met Office","This article severely misrepresents the scientific understanding of the processes responsible for observed changes in global sea level. Understanding and attributing the causes of changes in global sea level is an area of active research and there are genuine uncertainties, but there is a clear consensus on the important roles for ocean thermal expansion and addition of mass to the oceans from melting glaciers and ice caps during recent decades. For example, the following paper by Church et al. (2008)* summarizes the independent lines of evidence for changes in sea level from satellite altimeter and tide gauge measurements and how these changes can be explained by a combination of thermal expansion and exchange of mass (either liquid water or ice) between the oceans and continents:","Stefan Rahmstorf, Professor, Potsdam University","The article has almost nothing to do with the modern state of sea-level science. The author tries to call into question that global warming causes sea-level rise, and does so by cherry-picking a short segment of data from 1915-1945, a time when data quality is poor and the warming signal small—a bizarre approach that could never pass scientific peer review and is apparently aimed at misleading a lay audience.","Keven Roy, Research Fellow, Nanyang Technological University","This article is misleading, and presents inaccurate statements about global mean sea level rise.

This was introduced by famed oceanographer Walter Munk in a 2002 paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The enigma refers to a key discrepancy between the amount of sea-level rise believed to have occurred during the 20th century and the effects it should have produced on the planet — specifically, on the Earth’s rotation. So in addition to all the devastating and obvious effects sea-level rise will produce on the planet, such as flooding and erosion, sea-level rise also has the more subtle, but nonetheless mind-boggling ability to alter the way the Earth rotates on its axis. In a recent paper, Jerry Mitrovica and an interdisciplinary team of colleagues claim to have resolved the enigma. They reinforce the awe-inspiring power of climate change to produce global-scale effects, changing the planet’s very rotation. I don’t understand the relevance of citing Walter Munk to support Singer’s argument.",,,,I chose to assess the sea-level trend from 1915-45,"This is a blatant case of cherry picking to confirm a Singer’s position while ignoring all other instrumental sea level data that may contradict that position. This fallacy is a major problem in public debate.
","It is rather ironic that the author first complains about “poor data” and then goes on to cherry-pick a time of particularly poor data that includes the World War 2 period. Even the temperature data from this period are questionable; the sea surface temperature data show a strong warm peak at the end of WW2 (the basis of his claim of 0.5 °C warming) which is probably a data collection artefact, given that no such warming is seen in the data collected at the global network of weather stations on land. Also, in the peer-reviewed literature it has been shown that minor inaccuracies in sea-level data by just a few millimeters can lead to spurious fluctuations of sea level trends when too-short time intervals are considered*.

Rahmstorf et al (2011) Testing the robustness of semi-empirical sea level projections, Climate Dynamics",,,"I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming; it continues at the same rate, 1.8 millimeters a year, according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr.
","This claim is against the basic laws of physics—warming causes thermal expansion of sea water and thereby sea-level rise, full stop. This is true regardless of whether this effect can be detected in a cherry-picked short time interval with poor data quality.
","This is very misleading. Why is the author using a review dating from 1990, when there have been many publications over the past 28 years that show a much higher rate of Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise over the last few decades?

For instance, Hay et al* have looked at tide gauge records since the beginning of the 20th century and found that the rate of GMSL rise was 1.2 +/- 0.2 mm/yr over the 1901-1990 period, but 3.0 +/- 0.7 mm/yr over the 1993-2010 period (this period corresponds to the time for which we also have satellite altimetry measurements, which are consistent with this rate).

The author also talks about an “accelerating rate” of sea-level rise later in his article, which contradicts his own statement.

Third, independent estimates of these contributions to sea-level rise match the actually observed sea level rise.

"Business Insider highlights health impacts of climate change, but some aspects are misleading",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/business-insider-highlights-health-impacts-climate-change-aspects-are-misleading-kevin-loria/,"The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere just hit its highest level in 800,000 years and scientists predict deadly consequences",http://www.businessinsider.com/carbon-dioxide-record-human-health-effects-2018-5,"The average concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere topped 411 parts per million in May.
In April — the previous month — the concentration hit 410 ppm for the first time in recorded history.
These are the highest CO2 levels in the 800,000 years for which we have good data.
This is expected to have a catastrophic effect on human health and the planet. 
We have a pretty good idea of what Earth's atmosphere has looked like for the past 800,000 years.
Humans like us — Homo sapiens — evolved about 200,000 years ago, but ice-core records reveal intricate details of our planet's history from long before humans existed. By drilling more than 3 kilometers deep into the ice sheets over Greenland and Antarctica, scientists can see how temperature and atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels have changed.

From that record, we know the atmosphere and the air that we breathe has never had as much carbon dioxide in it as it does today.

For the first time in recorded history, the average monthly level of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeded 410 parts per million in April, according to observations at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. In May, that number climbed above 411 ppm, according to researchers from Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The record is not a coincidence — humans have rapidly transformed the air we breathe by pumping CO2 into it over the past two centuries. In recent years, we've pushed those gas levels into uncharted territory.

That change has inevitable and scary consequences. Research indicates that if unchecked, increased CO2 levels could cause pollution-related deaths to increase by tens of thousands, and lead to the slowing of human cognition (especially when you take into account the fact that CO2 levels tend to be higher indoors in cities). Carbon dioxide also contributes to warming that causes sea-level rise, searing heat waves, and superstorms.

""As a scientist, what concerns me the most is what this continued rise actually means: that we are continuing full speed ahead with an unprecedented experiment with our planet, the only home we have,"" Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist, said on Twitter.

Breathing the air of a new world
For the 800,000 years for which we have records, average global CO2 levels fluctuated between about 170 ppm and 280 ppm. Once humans started to burn fossil fuels in the industrial era, things changed rapidly.

Only in the industrial era has the number risen above 300 ppm. The concentration first crept above 400 ppm in 2013, and it continues to climb.

There's a debate among scientists about the last time CO2 levels were this high. It might have been during the Pliocene era, 2 million to 4.6 million years ago, when sea levels were 60 to 80 feet higher than today. Or it may have been in the Miocene, 10 million to 14 million years ago, when seas were more than 100 feet higher than now.

In our 800,000-year record, it took about 1,000 years for CO2 levels to increase by 35 ppm. We're currently averaging an increase of more than 2 ppm a year, meaning we could hit an average of 500 ppm within the next 45 years.

CO2 doesn't directly harm human health at these concentrations. But because it traps heat on the planet that then cranks up the global thermostat, it can have a very significant effect on health.

Global temperature tracks very closely to atmospheric levels of CO2. The potential effects of higher average temperatures include tens of thousands of deaths from heat waves, more extreme weather events, and the spread of diseases carried by ticks and mosquitoes — something we're already seeing. (There's a full list of possible ways climate change will affect human health on an archived Environmental Protection Agency page.)

Higher levels of CO2 and the warming they cause also exacerbate ozone pollution. One 2008 study found that for every degree Celsius the temperature rises because of CO2 levels, ozone pollution can be expected to kill an additional 22,000 people via respiratory illness, asthma, and emphysema.

Humans have never had to breathe air that's this polluted. Increased air pollution has been shown to cause lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and higher rates of allergies and asthma. A recent study found that 9 million people died prematurely from pollution-related diseases in 2015, accounting for 16% of all deaths worldwide.

Other research has raised even more concerns. The average CO2 level doesn't represent the air most of us breathe. Cities tend to have far more CO2 than average — and those levels rise even higher indoors. Some research indicates that it may have a negative effect on human cognition and decision-making. 

For these reasons, President Barack Obama's EPA ruled in 2009 that CO2 was a pollutant that needed to be regulated under the Clean Air Act. But the Trump administration is reevaluating that ruling.

Drowning in CO2
The human-health effects of CO2 increases are just one part of the bigger story here.

The change we've seen in CO2 levels recently has been much more rapid than the historical trends. Some experts think we're on track to hit 550 ppm by the end of the century, which could cause average global temperatures to rise by 6 degrees Celsius. For context, the increase in superstorms, rising sea levels, and spreading tick-borne disease that we're already seeing comes after a 0.9-degree rise.

Projections of sea-level rise will also get more extreme as CO2 levels continue to climb.

Right now, carbon-dioxide emissions are still rising. The goal set in the Paris agreement on climate change is to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius or less. But as a recent feature in the journal Nature revealed, we're on track for more than 3 degrees of warming.

The latest measurements show that if we want to avoid that dangerous scenario, we need to make dramatic changes very quickly.",neutral,Confused,34,"This article at Business Insider describes the impacts of climate change on human health which covering the fact that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere recently passed 410 parts per million.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that many of the listed impacts were described accurately and supported with links to relevant published studies. However, cited numbers for current deaths due to common air pollutants and the concentration at which CO2 itself can impact brain function are misleading. In their comments, the scientists provide context for interpreting these numbers. Additionally, the article’s language conflates CO2’s effect as a climate-changing gas with the direct health effects of other pollutants.","The article’s title point that CO2 levels are now the highest in 800,000 years is correct.

The health cost and deaths caused by climate change are underestimated. We are talking millions here, mostly in the poorer countries, linked to food and water security and to spread of infectious vector borne diseases (Dengue, Malaria).

There’s confusion with air pollution–a common confusion. However, air pollution is an additional burden caused by particulates, surface O3, and NOx, etc. in the air, which will be exacerbated by climate change causing untold misery to hundreds of millions of people.","Instead of improving clarity regarding climate change/warming/CO2 emissions and impacts, this article increases confusion by mixing direct impacts of CO2 and warming with indirect impacts related to warming and impacts (e.g air pollution) arising from some of the same sources as those responsible for much of the CO2 emissions. The article focuses on CO2 levels and suggests that CO2 itself (as opposed to climate change) is directly responsible for much of the impacts arising from these emissions—this is misleading and the article barely mentions the impact of CO2 on climate.",,,"Kristie Ebi, Professor, University of Washington","While it is positive that the author discussed the adverse health consequences of climate change, it appears the author selected studies projecting particularly high consequences. Other studies of how climate change could affect the same health outcomes project fewer injuries, illnesses, and deaths than those cited in the article, and project much lower risks when including adaptation and mitigation. The statement that 9 million people died prematurely from pollution-related diseases refers to more than just air pollution; the paper stated that in 2015, 4.2 million died prematurely from ambient particle pollution and 0.3 million from ambient ozone pollution*.

The cited study on cognition reported that ambient carbon dioxide can affect human decision-making performance at concentrations of 1,000 ppm and 2,500 ppm, from a baseline of 600 ppm. Assuming a rate of increase of carbon dioxide equivalent to the last five years (10 ppm in 5 years), it would be another 300 years before ambient concentrations exceed 1,000 ppm.

Landrigan et al (2017) The Lancet Commission on pollution and health, The Lancet","Jason West, Associate Professor, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","The article draws attention to the high CO2 at present and the health risks of climate change, but it gives the incorrect impression that breathing CO2 directly is a major cause of concern. The most important health effects of climate change—heat stress, vector-borne diseases, air pollution, access to food and water, severe storms, displacement—do get some discussion here.","Markus Donat, Research Fellow, University of New South Wales","To me, “CO2 levels could lead to tens of thousands of pollution-related deaths” sounds quite misleading because it seems to say people may die as a direct consequence of CO2 pollution (i.e., being poisoned?), but this is certainly not the case at the 550 ppm concentration mentioned later.

No doubt that increasing CO2 leads to warming—and this will cause rising sea levels and more intense and more frequent heat waves. “Superstorms” is less clear as to what the author means; there are no clear conclusions about the intensity of storm systems, but it is plausible and likely that the precipitation related to intense storms will increase due to the higher water holding capacity of warmer air.","Michael Henehan, Postdoctoral Researcher, GFZ Helmholtz Centre Potsdam","I think in general this article is pretty good—there are many links to peer-reviewed scientific studies in there, and in general the authors have done their homework. The writing suggests the author has a sufficiently clear understanding of the science, and doesn’t over extrapolate from the data. However, I think there are a few lapses in the article that display a tendency to over-hype.

For instance, one of the few times where the author doesn’t provide a reference is when they suggest a very high climate sensitivity to CO2 rise—+6˚C when we get to 550 ppm. I think this figure was taken from one of the other articles linked in this article, but in turn that article provides no reference for this claim. It’s a very high estimate compared to most models, and might betray a tendency of the author to emphasise the catastrophic.

Natural El Niño events affect the GBR once or twice a decade and have for thousands of years. Yet until recently they had only minor, if any impacts. It is the background warming of the seas, caused by greenhouse gas emissions, that is increasing the peaks of the ENSO cycle, making “heat waves” more severe. This natural cycle is essentially riding on the back of gradual increases in temperature over the last century.

Investor’s Business Daily editorial misrepresents study to claim plants will prevent dangerous climate change,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/investors-business-daily-editorial-misrepresents-study-to-claim-plants-will-prevent-dangerous-climate-change/,A Startling New Discovery Could Destroy All Those Global Warming Doomsday Forecasts,https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/global-warming-computer-model-nitrogen-rocks/,"Climate Change: Scientists just discovered a massive, heretofore unknown, source of nitrogen. Why does this matter? Because it could dramatically change those dire global warming forecasts that everybody claims are based on ""settled science.""

The researchers, whose findings were published in the prestigious journal Science, say they've determined that the idea that the only source of nitrogen for plant life came from the air is wrong. There are vast storehouses in the planet's bedrock that plants also feed on.

This is potentially huge news, since what it means is that there is a vastly larger supply of nitrogen than previously believed.

University of California at Davis environmental scientist and co-author of the study, Ben Houlton, says that ""This runs counter the centuries-long paradigm that has laid the foundation for the environmental sciences.""

Pay close attention to the word ""paradigm.""

If Houlton's finding about these vast, previously unknown nitrogen stores holds true, then it would have an enormous impact on global warming predictions.

Climate scientists have long known that plants offset some of the effects of climate change by absorbing and storing CO2. But climate scientists assumed that the ability to plants to perform this function was limited because the availability of nitrogen in the atmosphere was limited.

As a 2003 study published in the same Science journal put it, ""there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios.""

In the wake of the latest findings, Ronald Amundson, a soil biogeochemist at the University of California at Berkeley, told Chemical and Engineering News that ""If there is more nitrogen there than expected, then the constraints on plant growth in a high-CO2 world may not be as great as we think.""

In other words, with more nitrogen available, plant life might be able to absorb more CO2 than climate scientists have been estimating, which means the planet won't warm as much, despite mankind's pumping CO2 into the atmosphere.

A Stunning Finding
Houlton has been exploring this possibility for years. Back in 2011, he reported that forest trees can tap into nitrogen found in rock.

At the time, he said ""the stunning finding that forests can also feed on nitrogen in rocks has the potential to change all projections related to climate change,"" because it meant there could be more carbon storage on land and less in the atmosphere than climate models say.

The question is whether any climate scientists or environmentalists — who are entirely wedded to the idea that industrialization is destroying the planet — would ever admit this.

That's why that word ""paradigm"" is important.

As we've noted in this space, the idea of ""settled science"" peddled by environmentalists and politicians defies the history of science, which has seen repeated upheavals of previous forms of ""settled science.""

Thomas Kuhn studied this phenomenon in his 1962 book ""The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions."" He explained how scientists develop a theory — or paradigm — based on available evidence — to explain what they're seeing.

Once that paradigm takes hold, scientists are often loath to give up on it even if evidence piles up that it might be wrong. Eventually, however, faulty paradigms do give way, ushering in a new scientific paradigm. Examples of such paradigm shifts in the past: heliocentric solar system, continental drift, Einstein's theories.

A Coming Paradigm Shift?
That same thing might be happening right now with climate science.

As we've said many times, evidence continues to show weaknesses in climate models used to predict future warming. They failed to predict a decade-long pause in global temperatures. Nor have various calamities that were supposed to have occurred by now materialized. And a recent paper published in Nature concluded that the planet is less sensitive to increases in CO2 than the computer models say.

Meanwhile, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been conducting highly suspicious temperature data manipulation. The changes in the temperature data consistently make the past seem cooler, which in turn makes the present seem warmer.

This creates a data illusion of ever-rising temperatures to match the increase in CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere.

Marc Morano, editor of the popular ClimateDepot blog and author of ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change,"" notes that ""science is not supposed to have a politically predetermined outcome pushed by ideology and politics. This new nitrogen study is but one example of consensus science being overturned.  The global warming science establishment should now be open to similar studies and dissenting voices on CO2 to overturn the alleged climate change consensus.""

But will they?

With their reputations and huge amounts government grant money at stake, it's unlikely that many climate scientists would ever admit to being wrong. No matter how obvious it became that they were.",very_low,"Derogatory, Flawed reasoning, Misleading",287,"This editorial by Investor’s Business Daily centers on a recent study published in Science, which concerns the sources of nitrogen cycling through Earth’s ecosystems. The editorial then claims that this study shows that plants will be able to soak up future human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide because nitrogen is plentiful, proving projections of rapid global warming wrong.

The first author of the new Science study, and other scientists who reviewed the editorial, explained that this is incorrect and poorly reasoned. If the editorial’s claims about nitrogen availability for plants were true, past CO2 emissions would also have had little effect on the concentration in the atmosphere. We know this is false—the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing since daily measurements began in 1958, and the Earth has warmed as a result.","Our nitrogen study does not detract from the urgency of the climate problem, nor the unequivocal evidence of the role of carbon pollution in causing global climate change. The climate threat is clear and present and we must solve it rapidly by reducing emissions and capturing existing CO2 from the atmosphere.

Rock nitrogen, if shown to be a significant part of the terrestrial cycle in future research, will continue to contribute to carbon storage in vegetation and soil. But the amount of rock nitrogen available is not enough to counterbalance the need to aggressively reduce carbon emissions worldwide. Our study does not suggest or imply that rock nitrogen will solve global climate change. Rather, we must invest in a clean energy economy and create negative carbon capture technologies at scale to reduce the risks of climate change on people, infrastructure, natural habitats, and the economy.",,,,"Charles Koven, Staff Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab","This editorial totally misrepresents many things: the way nitrogen limitations are currently accounted for in global warming projections, the importance of the newly published work in governing carbon uptake by plants, and the way in which scientists construct models and incorporate new results.","Sara Vicca, Postdoctoral research fellow, University of Antwerp","The article includes several false statements and flawed reasonings, and suggests without evidence that scientists refuse to see when their model assumptions and projections are wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Scientists just discovered a massive, heretofore unknown, source of nitrogen”",That the rocks in the crust of the planet contain nitrogen has been known for in excess of a century.,,,,"“If Houlton’s finding about these vast, previously unknown nitrogen stores holds true, then it would have an enormous impact on global warming predictions.”",Misleading inference. Nitrogen availability is just one factor in net primary productivity (carbon sequestration over land). Other factors include but are not limited to seasonal temperatures and precipitation patterns and availability of other nutrients. In some areas nitrogen may well be limiting but to imply it is the limiting factor is without basis.,"This source has always existed, and still many ecosystems are nitrogen limited. This demonstrates that nitrogen from rocks cannot resolve nitrogen limitation.","This is wrong. The majority of Earth system models used for global warming projections in the most recent IPCC assessment didn’t include any nitrogen constraints at all. What this means is that they assumed plants would be able to take up excess CO2 without this nutrient limitation—so its a case where almost all the models have a known limitation that will bias their results towards assuming less global warming than they should. So the Houlton paper, if correct, suggesting that the limitation by nitrogen is weaker than some previous estimates, would still imply a stronger constraint than the Earth system models that don’t include nitrogen at all.",,“But climate scientists assumed that the ability to plants to perform this function was limited because the availability of nitrogen in the atmosphere was limited.”,"Given that nitrogen by volume constitutes 78% of the Earth’s atmosphere it could hardly be described as limited.

Climate scientists know that the ability is limited because we can, within uncertainties, close the carbon budget. This closure shows that roughly for every three carbon dioxide molecules emitted by fossil fuel combustion one is ending up in the ocean, one in the terrestrial biosphere, and one remains in the atmosphere. This is an observed and verified behaviour. Plants are removing approximately 1/3 of the excess carbon added by humans and this has remained broadly stable over several decades.",,,,“‘there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios.’”,"This is around whether there may be a reduction in the ability in future of the terrestrial biosphere to uptake carbon. If nitrogen is the sole limitation then indeed the risk is a reduction in ability of the biosphere to uptake carbon. But, it is over-simplistic to consider nitrogen uptake the sole potential limiting factor as implied by this quotation.",,,,"“Houlton has been exploring this possibility for years. Back in 2011, he reported that forest trees can tap into nitrogen found in rock. At the time, he said ‘the stunning finding that forests can also feed on nitrogen in rocks has the potential to change all projections related to climate change,’ because it meant there could be more carbon storage on land and less in the atmosphere than climate models say.”",It should be noted that much of the Net Primary Productivity arises from grasses and other non-boreal sources.

"Washington Post accurately covers permafrost study, albeit under a somewhat sensational headline",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/washington-post-accurately-covers-permafrost-study-albeit-under-a-somewhat-sensational-headline-chris-mooney/,The Arctic’s carbon bomb might be even more potent than we thought,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/03/19/the-arctics-carbon-bomb-might-be-even-more-potent-than-we-thought/?utm_term=.11dbcfb64830,"For some time, scientists fearing the mass release of greenhouse gases from the carbon-rich, frozen soils of the Arctic have had at least one morsel of good news in their forecasts: They predicted most of the gas released would be carbon dioxide, which, though a greenhouse gas, drives warming more slowly than some other gases. Scientists obviously weren’t excited about more carbon dioxide emissions, but it was better than the alternative: methane, a shorter-lived but far harder-hitting gas that could cause faster bursts of warming.
Now even that silver lining is in doubt.
Research released Monday suggests that methane releases could be considerably more prevalent as Arctic permafrost thaws. The research finds that in waterlogged wetland soils, where oxygen is not prevalent, tiny microorganisms will produce a considerable volume of methane, a gas that doesn’t last in the air much more than a decade but has a warming effect many times that of carbon dioxide over a period of 100 years.

“What we can definitely say is that the importance of methane was underestimated until now in the carbon studies,” said Christian Knobloch, a researcher at Universität Hamburg in Germany and the lead author of the study, published in Nature Climate Change.
The Arctic is full of toxic mercury, and climate change is going to release it
The divergent finding came after Knoblauch and his colleagues conducted a lengthy experiment, more than seven years long, monitoring patches of submerged and artificially warmed soil from Siberia in the laboratory, and gradually seeing sensitive methane-producing microorganisms become more prevalent over time.
Knoblauch contends that other studies have not examined waterlogged Arctic soils for as long, and he notes that in some cases it took three years or more for the methane-generating microorganisms to really get cranking.
“What we saw is that it takes a very long time until methane starts being produced, and the study that we did is really the first one which is so long,” Knoblauch said.
The research was conducted along with colleagues from several institutions in Germany, Sweden and Russia.
So much methane was produced in the experiment, the researchers calculated that the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from wet soils, or wetlands, will be higher than from drier soils, where carbon dioxide should indeed be the top gas released. This finding, if further confirmed, could reorient calculations of the overall potential of permafrost to worsen global warming over the coming century.
‘We all knew this was coming’: Alaska’s thawing soils are now pouring carbon dioxide into the air
For instance, one major study of the permafrost warming potential, published in 2015 in the journal Nature, played down the potential for methane release in wet soils, saying drier soils would be the bigger problem.
“In spite of the more potent greenhouse gas CH4, a unit of newly thawed permafrost carbon could have a greater impact on climate over a century if it thaws and decomposes within a drier, aerobic soil as compared to an equivalent amount of carbon within a waterlogged soil or sediment,” that research found. The new study would appear to contradict this.
But Knoblauch cautions that more research would have to be done to go from these results to a forecast for just how much methane could waft from permafrost in the coming decades. It will be important to know, for instance, how much thawed permafrost will be stuck in watery conditions vs. dry ones.
One Arctic permafrost expert not involved in the research, Merritt Turetsky of the University of Guelph, praised the new study, noting that the researchers had spent a long time trying to uncover the behavior of tiny methane-producing organisms in watery soil. The research, she said, could help bridge the gap between field studies of waterlogged permafrost that have detected methane emissions and laboratory studies that have seemed to play down the importance of the gas.
“What’s remarkable about this study is the length of time they spent tracking the communities, and I think that offers a potential reason for why field and lab studies have disagreed with each other,” Turetsky said.
Warming of the Arctic is ‘unprecedented over the last 1,500 years,’ scientists say
She said the total amount of permafrost carbon that could be vulnerable because of global warming during this century — perhaps 10 percent of it, which would be more than enough to undermine global climate goals — probably won’t change in light of the new research. But the fraction of that carbon that is emitted as methane, as opposed to carbon dioxide, will be crucial, she said, and remains to be determined.
“We absolutely have to partition that total permafrost carbon release into those two forms, because it really matters,” Turetsky said. “So I think that has got to be where the community goes next.”
But Róisín Commane, a research associate at Harvard who studies the Arctic atmosphere and also was not involved in this research, was more skeptical about relying on this study to assume a worse verdict about methane.
The study was “very nicely done,” she said, but the tendency of wet soils to produce methane could be counteracted by several factors. The soils could also become host to organisms that devour that methane — and turn it into carbon dioxide. And, as the Arctic continues to warm, soils might not retain as much water, as the subsurface ice that held it in place gradually gives way, she noted.
“How much of it makes it into the atmosphere is the big thing,” Commane said. “Ecosystems will probably produce more methane as they stay wet. The big question we have is, how much of that makes it into the atmosphere, and I don’t think they get to that question here.”",very_high,"Accurate, Sound reasoning",237,"This article in The Washington Post describes new research on greenhouse gas emissions from thawing permafrost—specifically the balance of carbon dioxide vs. methane released from waterlogged permafrost soils.

Financial Post publishes misleading opinion that misrepresents science of polar bears’ plight,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/financial-post-publishes-misleading-opinion-misrepresents-science-polar-bears-peril-susan-crockford/,Polar bears keep thriving even as global warming alarmists keep pretending they’re dying,http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/polar-bears-keep-thriving-even-as-global-warming-alarmists-keep-pretending-theyre-dying,"One powerful polar bear fact is slowly rising above the message of looming catastrophe repeated endlessly by the media: More than 15,000 polar bears have not disappeared since 2005. Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050, the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn’t happen. Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved. The polar bear’s resilience should have meant the end of its use as a cherished icon of global warming doom, but it didn’t. The alarmism is not going away without a struggle.

Part of this struggle involves a scientific clash about transparency in polar bear science. My close examination of recent research has revealed that serious inconsistencies exist within the polar bear literature and between that literature and public statements made by some researchers. For example, Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart, depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet. But that fact, documented in more than a dozen scientific papers, is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology. In these days of politicized science, neither Stirling nor his colleagues mention in public the devastating effects of thick spring ice in the Beaufort Sea; instead, they imply in recent papers that the starving bears they witnessed are victims of reduced summer sea ice, which they argued depleted the bears’ prey. There are also strong indications that thick spring-ice conditions happened again in 2014–16, with the impacts on polar bears being similarly portrayed as effects of global warming.

The polar bear's resilience should have meant the end of its use as an icon of global warming doom

One reason that the 2007 predictions of future polar bear survival were so far off base is that the model developed by American biologist Steven Amstrup (now at Polar Bears International, an NGO) assumed any polar bear population decline would be caused by less summer ice, despite the Beaufort Sea experience. Moreover, Amstrup and fellow modelers were overly confident in their claim that summer ice was critical for the polar bear’s survival and they had little data on which to base their assumption that less summer ice would devastate the polar bears’ prey.

Consequently, many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals (the primary prey of polar bears) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season, which is particularly conducive to fishing: These seals do most of their feeding in summer. More food for seals in summer means more fat seal pups for polar bears to eat the following spring, a result that’s probably true throughout the Arctic.

As long as polar bears have lots of baby seals to eat in spring, they get fat enough to survive even a longer-than-usual summer fast. And while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.

Not all bears get enough to eat in the spring, of course. Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears, due to a number of factors including competition, injury, tooth decay and illness. Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss. This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year. The videographers claimed it showed what starvation due to sea-ice loss looked like — an implausible conclusion given the time of year, the isolated nature of the incident, and the fact that sea ice that year was no more reduced than previously.

That starving-bear video may have convinced a few more gullible people that only hundreds of polar bears are left in the world. But it also motivated others to locate the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List report for 2015 that estimated global polar bear numbers at somewhere between 22,000-31,000, or about 26,000, up slightly from 20,000-25,000, or about 22,500, in 2005. Newer counts not included in the 2015 assessment potentially add another 2,500 or so to the total. This increase may not be statistically significant, but it is decidedly not the 67-per-cent decline that was predicted given the ice conditions that prevailed.

The failure of the 2007 polar bear survival model is a simple fact that explodes the myth that polar bears are on their way to extinction. Although starving-bear videos and scientifically insignificant research papers still make the news, they don’t alter the facts: Polar bears are thriving, making them phony icons, and false idols, for global warming alarmists.",very_low,"Biased, Cherry-picking, Misleading",292,"This article in the opinion section of Financial Post, written by Susan Crockford, claims that rather than being threatened by declining Arctic sea ice, polar bears are “thriving”.

","This blogger has repeatedly criticized polar bear projections because what we predicted for mid-century has not yet happened. Most of the climate model projections for sea ice decline show summer ice down to near zero by mid century and they all converge on zero by the end of the century. None of the mainstream models of which I am aware project that summer ice would be gone by now. Of course summer ice availability has been reduced from earlier years, but neither observations nor models suggest that what we predicted for mid century has already happened. Here is an image that may help put this in perspective, and make it clear why our projections focused on mid century and beyond, and that we are not yet in mid-century:

","This is nonsense. No polar bear scientist has predicted a drop in polar bear abundance based on summer sea ice. We base the assessment of loss on duration of the ice-free period. Papers1,2 from our research group assess this point. The statement about global polar bear numbers is absolutely unfounded.

Castro de la Guarida1 states, “Sea ice across the Arctic is declining and altering physical characteristics of marine ecosystems. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have been identified as vulnerable to changes in sea ice conditions. We use sea ice projections for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago from 2006 – 2100 to gain insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears with respect to habitat loss using metrics developed from polar bear energetics modeling. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Shifts away from multiyear ice to annual ice cover throughout the region, as well as lengthening ice-free periods, may become critical for polar bears before the end of the 21st century with projected warming. Each polar bear population in the Archipelago may undergo 2-5 months of ice-free conditions, where no such conditions exist presently. We identify spatially and temporally explicit ice-free periods that extend beyond what polar bears require for nutritional and reproductive demands. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Under business-as-usual climate projections, polar bears may face starvation and reproductive failure across the entire Archipelago by the year 2100.”

Both of these studies1,2 assess the threat to polar bears based on projected sea ice loss over the next 3 generations (ca. 33-45 years). It is an issue of fasting duration that causes polar bear population declines and this is well understood in the published literature.
Dr. Crockford is following the standard climate change denier approach of picking on a specific detail and then contriving an unsubstantiated fictional account on that point. Loss of sea ice in summer is, by and large, irrelevant. It’s the duration of the ice-free period that matters. If not, polar bears in Hudson Bay would have disappeared hundreds or thousands of years ago but they didn’t because they used to be able to obtain sufficient fat stores while hunting seals on the sea ice in spring. The situation is changing but the best estimate is that we’ll have significant declines in the Western Hudson Bay population (beyond the current ca. 30% decline) by mid-century. By repeating it often enough, it appears that deniers or the uninformed think there’s some merit to the issue Dr. Crockford has raised. Nobody can scientifically rebut the flawed thesis because it isn’t published. My understanding was that the manuscript was rejected by scientific journals so now Dr. Crockford’s manuscript languishes as an unreviewed “Preprint” in PeerJ and she erroneously calls it a “paper”.

2- Regehr et al (2016) Conservation status of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in relation to projected sea-ice declines, Biology Letters",,,"“For example, Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart, depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet. But that fact, documented in more than a dozen scientific papers, is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology.”","Both Ian Stirling and I have published on the inter-annual and even multi-annual variation in sea ice extent, etc. There is a great deal of annual variation among years, as always. And as the observations and models illustrate, the variation (caused by the natural chaos in the climate system) that always has been observed will continue into the future. Ian specifically mentioned in some early publications that there seemed a nearly decadal oscillation in ice thickness, etc.

Ideal habitat for polar bears and ice loving seals (like all animals) follows a kind of bell-shaped curve. Ice can be too thick and heavy, just right, or too thin (which also means it doesn’t persist long during the melt season). Most of those early years there was plenty of ice that persisted through the summer in the Beaufort Sea. Even most light ice years had enough ice there to not be a problem. Some years (and seemingly on about 10 year intervals) were characterized by ice that was apparently too heavy to be ideal for seals and bears, and in those years productivity of both declined. It is important to point out that the concept of an approximate 10-year oscillation was based on 3 decades (70s, 80s, and 90s) and a sample size of 3 may not really be enough to establish some kind of natural cycle.

Regardless, as the world has warmed and ice continued to thin, evidence of any such cycle in the Alaskan Beaufort has disappeared. We did not see a crush of heavier ice in the middle of the first or second decades of the 2000s. Rather, the situation now is that ice is thin every year and has not persisted through the melt season in the critical continental shelf waters. Why would researchers spend much time now discussing a pattern in the sea ice that no longer rises to historic levels? Whether they are part of a larger scale oscillation or more regional weather patterns, year to year and multi-year differences in the amount of sea ice and its character are part of the natural variation in the climate system that will continue as the world warms due to human activity.

Global warming doesn’t mean that every year will be a bit warmer than the previous or that the sea ice extent will be a bit lower. Rather it means that the average of the natural variations over multiple years is and will continue to be warmer temperatures and less sea ice. Without persistent greenhouse gas rise, the historic averages of natural variations in global temperature and Arctic sea ice extent were approximately horizontal baselines—both temperature and sea ice extent were without major trend when examined over decades. With persistently rising greenhouse gas levels all of the natural variation still occurs, but now occurs over inclined rather than level baselines.

With greenhouse gas levels constantly rising, there still are near-term fluctuations in annual and seasonal temperatures. Some years warmer and some cooler than the one before, but the average over decades is a rising trend line. Likewise, some years have had and will have more summer ice than the previous year, and some less. Whether those short term variations in Arctic sea ice extent are due to annual weather influences or multi-year cycles driven by broader oceanic patterns, they are now and will continue to be occurring over a declining baseline as long as greenhouse gas levels continue to rise. Hence, it is not the swings in individual years or groups of years, but rather the trend line that is our concern. And as long as greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise, average temperatures can only increase and average sea ice extent can only decline.

The average Arctic summer sea ice extent already is so far below the historic levels that recent short term fluctuations have not overlapped with levels of just a few decades ago. Hence, what might have been called relatively “heavier” ice years are now light years by historic standards.
","Sea ice conditions are well document to be in steep decline in the southern Beaufort Sea. This polar bear population has declined 25-50% and the loss is related to sea ice loss. There are many papers that address this issue extensively. Heavy sea ice conditions are largely a past issue for ringed seals. It is loss of sea ice habitat as a whole that is negatively affecting ringed seals and thus polar bears. Polar bears have a Goldilocks relationship with sea ice: not too much, not too little, it has to be just right. Dr. Crockford is playing the “too much” sea ice issue to its extreme and ignores the too little aspect altogether.

These two papers1,2 are core but there are many more addressing sea ice loss in the Beaufort and the effects on polar bears.

1- Bromaghin et al (2015) Polar bear population dynamics in the southern Beaufort Sea during a period of sea ice decline, Ecological Applications
2- Hunter et al (2010) Climate change threatens polar bear populations: a stochastic demographic analysis, Ecology",,,"“many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals (the primary prey of polar bears) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season, which is particularly conducive to fishing”

","The Chukchi sea is essentially all continental shelf and is probably the most productive of the Arctic Seas. This is in contrast to the Beaufort Sea which, beyond the very narrow continental shelf, is very unproductive. Recent research has shown that this tremendous productivity and the fact that, although ice has significantly retreated, bears there still have fewer ice free days over the shelf than in the Beaufort, can explain why Chukchi Sea polar bears have not yet declined like those in the Beaufort.

","Both ringed seals and bearded seals are sea ice obligate species: there are significant conservation concerns about both species across the Arctic. The basis of the statement that the seals are thriving is unfounded in the peer-reviewed literature. Both species are listed under the US Endangered Species Act.

The polar bears living north of the Bering Strait have not shown the same loss in body condition, survival, and reproduction noted in the neighboring Beaufort Sea because the ecosystems are vastly different in the distribution of continental shelf habitat: huge area in the Chukchi Sea, a narrow band in the Beaufort. Polar bear populations respond to local changes, and with 19 polar bear populations, there will be 19 different scenarios playing out over time. Loss of sea ice in the Chukchi Sea in winter 2017/18 may change the situation there.",,,"“while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.”

","We know that polar bears depend on the ice surface to catch their prey. We know that increasing numbers of ice free days have resulted in poorer body condition in some areas (e.g. Southern Beaufort, Western and Southern Hudson Bay), we know that poorer cub survival has followed both declining ice and poorer body condition, and all the evidence suggests these things are linked. Perhaps this is not “proof” that less available summer ice is the cause (correlation does not necessarily imply causation), but I am not aware of evidence for any other explanation. And I don’t think the female polar bears are intentionally having cubs but not feeding them.

","There is evidence. Bromaghin et al 20151 and Hunter et al 20102 examine this issue.

Bromaghin et al state, “Low survival from 2004 through 2006 led to a 25–50% decline in abundance. We hypothesize that low survival during this period resulted from (1) unfavorable ice conditions that limited access to prey during multiple seasons; and possibly, (2) low prey abundance. For reasons that are not clear, survival of adults and cubs began to improve in 2007 and abundance was comparatively stable from 2008 to 2010, with ~900 bears in 2010 (90% CI 606–1212). However, survival of subadult bears declined throughout the entire period. Reduced spatial and temporal availability of sea ice is expected to increasingly force population dynamics of polar bears as the climate continues to warm. However, in the short term, our findings suggest that factors other than sea ice can influence survival.”

Hunter et al stated, “Deterministic models projected population growth in years with more extensive ice coverage (2001-2003) and population decline in years with less ice coverage (2004-2005). LTRE (life table response experiment) analysis showed that the reduction in lambda in years with low sea ice was due primarily to reduced adult female survival, and secondarily to reduced breeding. A stochastic model with two environmental states, good and poor sea ice conditions, projected a declining stochastic growth rate, log lambda(s), as the frequency of poor ice years increased. The observed frequency of poor ice years since 1979 would imply log lambda(s) approximate to -0.01, which agrees with available (albeit crude) observations of population size. The stochastic model was linked to a set of 10 GCMs compiled by the IPCC; the models were chosen for their ability to reproduce historical observations of sea ice and were forced with “business as usual” (A1B) greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting stochastic population projections showed drastic declines in the polar bear population by the end of the 21st century. These projections were instrumental in the decision to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the U. S. Endangered Species Act.”

"New satellite measurements show sea level rise is accelerating, as CNN accurately reports",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/satellite-measurements-accelerating-sea-level-rise-cnn-accurately-reports-brandon-miller/,"Satellite observations show sea levels rising, and climate change is accelerating it",https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/12/world/sea-level-rise-accelerating/index.html,"(CNN)Sea level rise is happening now, and the rate at which it is rising is increasing every year, according to a study released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Researchers, led by University of Colorado-Boulder professor of aerospace engineering sciences Steve Nerem, used satellite data dating to 1993 to observe the levels of the world's oceans.

Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.
The team observed a total rise in the ocean of 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) in 25 years of data, which aligns with the generally accepted current rate of sea level rise of about 3 millimeters (0.1 inches) per year.
But that rate is not constant.
Continuous emissions of greenhouse gases are warming the Earth's atmosphere and oceans and melting its ice, causing the rate of sea level rise to increase.
""This acceleration, driven mainly by accelerated melting in Greenland and Antarctica, has the potential to double the total sea level rise by 2100 as compared to projections that assume a constant rate, to more than 60 centimeters instead of about 30,"" said Nerem, who is also a fellow with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science.

That projection agrees perfectly with climate models used in the latest International Panel on Climate Change report, which show sea level rise to be between 52 and 98 centimeters by 2100 for a ""business as usual"" scenario (in which greenhouse emissions continue without reduction).
Therefore, scientists now have observed evidence validating climate model projections, as well as providing policy-makers with a ""data-driven assessment of sea level change that does not depend on the climate models,"" Nerem said.
Sea level rise of 65 centimeters, or roughly 2 feet, would cause significant problems for coastal cities around the world. Extreme water levels, such as high tides and surges from strong storms, would be made exponentially worse.
Consider the record set in Boston Harbor during January's ""bomb cyclone"" or the inundation regularly experienced in Miami during the King tides; these are occurring with sea levels that have risen about a foot in the past 100 years.

Now, researchers say we could add another 2 feet by the end of this century.
Nerem and his team took into account natural changes in sea level thanks to cycles such as El Niño/La Niña and even events such as the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, which altered sea levels worldwide for several years.
The result is a ""climate-change-driven"" acceleration: the amount the sea levels are rising because of the warming caused by manmade global warming.
The researchers used data from other scientific missions such as GRACE, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, to determine what was causing the rate to accelerate.

NASA's GRACE mission used satellites to measure changes in ice mass. This image shows areas of Antarctica that gained or lost ice between 2002 and 2016.
Currently, over half of the observed rise is the result of ""thermal expansion"": As ocean water warms, it expands, and sea levels rise. The rest of the rise is the result of melted ice in Greenland and Antarctica and mountain glaciers flowing into the oceans.
Theirs is a troubling finding when considering the recent rapid ice loss in the ice sheets.
""Sixty-five centimeters is probably on the low end for 2100,"" Nerem said, ""since it assumes the rate and acceleration we have seen over the last 25 years continues for the next 82 years.""

""We are already seeing signs of ice sheet instability in Greenland and Antarctica, so if they experience rapid changes, then we would likely see more than 65 centimeters of sea level rise by 2100.""
Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann, who was not involved with the study, said ""it confirms what we have long feared: that the sooner-than-expected ice loss from the west Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets is leading to acceleration in sea level rise sooner than was projected.""",very_high,"Accurate, Sound reasoning",167,"This article at CNN reports on a new study that calculates the acceleration of sea level rise that has become apparent in the record of satellite measurements, which began in 1993. Because the satellite record is so short, this acceleration has not been clear until recently.

The article could have clarified for context that many studies have analyzed sea level rise trends in tide gauge data going back to the early 20th century.",,,,,"Keven Roy, Research Fellow, Nanyang Technological University","This is, in general, a good article that represents quite well the message from the study under discussion, with only a few statements that could have been clarified.

However, I think that the article would have gained from placing the study in a better context, as there have been other data-based assessments of 21st century sea level rise1,2 (process-based or statistical). A comparison to assessments of modern sea level rise that included tide gauge data3 would have been useful too.

National Geographic video of starving polar bear should have clarified uncertain link to climate change,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/national-geographic-video-starving-polar-bear-should-have-clarified-uncertain-link-climate-change-sarah-gibbens/,Heart-Wrenching Video Shows Starving Polar Bear on Iceless Land,https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/polar-bear-starving-arctic-sea-ice-melt-climate-change-spd/,"When photographer Paul Nicklen and filmmakers from conservation group Sea Legacy arrived on Somerset Island—near the larger Baffin Island—in the Canadian Arctic in late summer, they came across a heartbreaking sight: a starving polar bear on its deathbed.

Nicklen is no stranger to bears. From the time he was a child growing up in Canada's far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild. But the emaciated polar bear, featured in videos Nicklen published to social media on December 5, was one of the most gut-wrenching sights he's ever seen.

""We stood there crying—filming with tears rolling down our cheeks,"" he said.

Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear's back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground.

In the days since Nicklen posted the footage, he's been asked why he didn’t intervene.

""Of course, that crossed my mind,"" said Nicklen. ""But it's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat.""

And even if he did, said Nicklen, he only would have been prolonging the bear's misery. Plus, feeding wild polar bears is illegal in Canada.

The wildlife photographer says he filmed the bear's slow, beleaguered death because he didn't want it to die in vain.

""When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like. Bears are going to starve to death,"" said Nicklen. ""This is what a starving bear looks like.""

The Climate Change Link?
By telling the story of one polar bear, Nicklen hopes to convey a larger message about how a warming climate has deadly consequences.

Polar bears have long been unwitting mascots for the effects of climate change. As animals that live only in Arctic regions, they're often the first to feel the impacts of warming temperatures and rising seas.

The large, half-ton bears find concentrations of seals on sea ice. During summer months, it's not uncommon for polar bears to go months without eating while they wait for Arctic ice to solidify.

In 2002, a World Wildlife Fund report predicted that climate change could eventually lead to polar bear endangerment or extinction. Even then, the report found that polar bears were moving from ice to land earlier and staying on land longer, unhealthily extending the bears' fasting season. By the end of summer, most bears studied by the World Wildlife Fund showed signs of starvation.

Fifteen years later, polar bears' icy hunting grounds are in even worse shape. The National Snow and Ice Data Center, which tracks sea ice cover annually, has regularly noted record lows in sea ice coverage—a decline that is expected to only get worse. (Read more about drastic predictions for dwindling sea ice.)

A study recently published in the journal Biosciences looked at how climate science is often falsely discredited. The study found climate deniers are able to downplay the threat of climate change by discrediting the threat facing polar bears.

See Photos of Polar Bears in the Wild

However, a study published last year by the European Geosciences Union and this year by the U.S. Geological Survey confirms melting sea ice continues to be an existential threat to polar bears.",neutral,"Accurate, Misleading",12,"This widely-shared December 2017 article at National Geographic featured emotional footage of a starving polar bear, highlighting the plight of polar bears as the extent of Arctic sea ice declines.

Scientists who reviewed the article explained that the connection to climate change should have been explained more carefully. While polar bears will face more difficulties reaching prey as Arctic sea ice continues to diminish, it is also true that starvation is a common natural cause of death for polar bears. It is not known whether this polar bear’s death was a result of human-caused sea ice conditions, even if it does provide a visceral example of the fate many polar bears will suffer due to climate change.

","The article contains valid information on the devastating consequences of climate change on polar bears. The only problem as I see it is that the article presents (implicitly) that the polar bear in the video is dying as a consequence of climate change and from not finding enough food due to lack of sea ice. This issue that this bear might be dying from starvation naturally due to sickness or old age should be stated more clearly in the article (and this concern has been raised in the media, by experts, already). The only flawed reasoning is the strong IMPLICIT link between climate change and the death of this particular bear in the video. However, the wording used in the article, “this is what is starving polar bear looks like…” is true. While it could be presented better in this (central) aspect, the article’s content, overall, is credible.
","This reveals what declining survival looks like for polar bears, a trend we will see increase as the world warms. But the article neglected to point out this bear’s problems may or may not have had much to do with declining sea ice in the Baffin area—an error of omission that can become a target of global warming deniers.

The important lesson from the observations shown is that ever-more polar bears will be suffering this kind of fate as we allow the world to continue to warm. Largely by omission, this article suggests we know what led to this bear’s demise, and we don’t. Starvation is the main cause of death among wild polar bears. After all, they have few natural predators. Starvation rates will increase (decreased survival rates) as sea ice continues to decline. But we must be careful in presenting an observation like this as the fingerprint of climate warming. Without proper context, observations and stories like this can distract from the critical message we need to get out.
",,,"Stephen Hamilton, PhD Candidate, University of Alberta","The 2002 WWF report and NSIDC findings cited would be better replaced with peer-reviewed literature, of which there are many high-quality and more modern choices. Furthermore, there is good work done on polar bear energetic needs and how land-based nutrition is insufficient for their diet*.

The title’s inclusion of “iceless land” could give the impression that being on land is the cause of starvation in itself. Nevertheless, the article correctly mentions that it is not uncommon for bears to fast for months.

Named in 2011, the American Psychological Association recently described it as the dread and helplessness that come with “watching the slow and seemingly irrevocable impacts of climate change unfold, and worrying about the future for oneself, children, and later generations.”

It’s not a formal diagnosis. Anxiety is traditionally defined by an outsized stress response to a given stimulus. In this case, the stimulus is real, as are the deleterious effects of stress on the body.

This sort of disposition toward ecological-based distress does not pair well with a president who has denied the reality of the basis for this anxiety. Donald Trump has called climate change a fabrication on the part of “the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” He has also led the United States to become the only G20 country that will not honor the Paris Climate Accord, and who has appointed fossil-fuel advocates to lead the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency.

For people who experience climate-related anxiety, this all serves as a sort of exacerbation by presidential gaslight. The remedy for a condition like this is knowing what can be done to mitigate environmental degradation, from within in a country singularly committed to it.

Beyond ‘Vegetarian’
BRIAN KATEMAN

Will We Ever Stop Eating Animal Meat?
DEREK THOMPSON
Like what?

Helen Harwatt is a researcher trained in environmental nutrition, a field focused on developing food systems that balance human health and sustainability. She’s interested in policy, but realistic about how much progress can be expected under the aforementioned leadership. So she and colleagues have done research on maximizing the impacts of individuals. As with so many things in life and health, that tends to come down to food.

Recently Harwatt and a team of scientists from Oregon State University, Bard College, and Loma Linda University calculated just what would happen if every American made one dietary change: substituting beans for beef. They found that if everyone were willing and able to do that—hypothetically—the U.S. could still come close to meeting its 2020 greenhouse-gas emission goals, pledged by President Barack Obama in 2009.

That is, even if nothing about our energy infrastructure or transportation system changed—and even if people kept eating chicken and pork and eggs and cheese—this one dietary change could achieve somewhere between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the target.

“I think there’s genuinely a lack of awareness about how much impact this sort of change can have,” Harwatt told me. There have been analyses in the past about the environmental impacts of veganism and vegetarianism, but this study is novel for the idea that a person’s dedication to the cause doesn’t have to be complete in order to matter. A relatively small, single-food substitution could be the most powerful change a person makes in terms of their lifetime environmental impact—more so than downsizing one’s car, or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs, and certainly more than quitting showering.

To understand why the climate impact of beef alone is so large, note that the image at the top of this story is a sea of soybeans in a silo in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle, the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day. Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows, and the cows will convert the beans to meat, and the humans will eat the meat. In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas, and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat, meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people.

This inefficient process happens on a massive scale. Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of red meat, holds around 212 million cattle. (In June, the U.S. temporarily suspended imports of beef from Brazil due to abscesses, collections of pus, in the meat.) According to the United Nations, 33 percent of arable land on Earth is used to grow feed for livestock. Even more, 26 percent of the ice-free terrestrial surface of Earth is used for grazing livestock. In all, almost a third of the land on Earth is used to produce meat and animal products.

This means much less deforestation and land degradation if so many plant crops weren’t run through the digestive tracts of cattle. If Americans traded their beef for beans, the researchers found, that would free up 42 percent of U.S. crop land.

“The real beauty of this kind of thing is that climate impact doesn’t have to be policy-driven,” said Harwatt. “It can just be a positive, empowering thing for consumers to see that they can make a significant impact by doing something as simple as eating beans instead of beef.”

She and her colleagues conclude in the journal Climatic Change: “While not currently recognized as a climate policy option, the ‘beans for beef’ scenario offers significant climate change mitigation and other environmental benefits, illustrating the high potential of animal to plant food shifts.”

The beans for beef scenario is, it seems, upon us.

“I think it’s such an easy-to-grasp concept that it could be less challenging than a whole dietary shift,” said Harwatt. The words vegetarian and vegan have stifled some people’s thinking on what it means to eat well—to consume responsibly, conscientiously. Rather the beans for beef scenario is the dietary equivalent of effective altruism—focusing on where efforts will have the highest yield. “It’s kind of a worst-first approach, looking at the hottest spot in the food system in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, and what could that be substituted with without losing protein and calories in the food system?

In addition to the well-documented health benefits of a plant-based diet, this case also brings empowerment, or at least reprieve.

Imports account for around 12% of beef consumed in the US, and Brazil contributes with only 5% of imports, while Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico provide 86% of beef imported (see ERS-USDA webpage). Thus, lowering beef consumption in the US is far from affecting Brazilian forests.

On the other hand, it is not true that eliminating beef from diets will produce such reductions in GHG emissions. The author cites conclusions from a single work, but there are hundreds of works published on diet and mitigation of climate change. The consensus is that a well-planned diet change would lower greenhouse gas emissions, but none agree that banning a single product would bring any benefit. Not only beef but all animal products are much less efficient than plant-based ones, and meats other than beef also carry environmental burdens beyond greenhouse gases.

But the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula has been fundamentally changed, according to Project Midas, a research team from Swansea University and Aberystwyth University in Britain that had been monitoring the rift since 2014.

“The remaining shelf will be at its smallest ever known size,” said Adrian Luckman, a lead researcher for Project Midas. “This is a big change. Maps will need to be redrawn.”

Larsen C, like two smaller ice shelves that collapsed before it, was holding back relatively little land ice, and it is not expected to contribute much to the rise of the sea. But in other parts of Antarctica, similar shelves are holding back enormous amounts of ice, and scientists fear that their future collapse could dump enough ice into the ocean to raise the sea level by many feet. How fast this could happen is unclear.

In the late 20th century, the Antarctic Peninsula, which juts out from the main body of Antarctica and points toward South America, was one of the fastest-warming places in the world. That warming had slowed or perhaps reversed slightly in the 21st century, but scientists believe the ice is still catching up to the higher temperatures.

Some climate scientists believe the warming in the region was at least in part a consequence of human-caused climate change, while others have disputed that, seeing a large role for natural variability — and noting that icebergs have been breaking away from ice shelves for many millions of years. But the two camps agree that the breakup of ice shelves in the peninsula region may be a preview of what is in store for the main part of Antarctica as the world continues heating up as a result of human activity.

“While it might not be caused by global warming, it’s at least a natural laboratory to study how breakups will occur at other ice shelves to improve the theoretical basis for our projections of future sea level rise,” said Thomas P. Wagner, who leads NASA’s efforts to study the polar regions.

The time-lapse image below shows the rift gradually widening from late 2014 to January of this year.

In frigid regions, ice shelves form as the long rivers of ice called glaciers flow from land into the sea. The result is a bit like a clog in a drain pipe, slowing the flow of the glaciers feeding them. When an ice shelf collapses, the glaciers behind it can accelerate, as though the drain pipe had suddenly cleared.

At the remaining part of Larsen C, the edge is now much closer to a line that scientists call the compressive arch, which is critical for structural support. If the front retreats past that line, the northernmost part of the shelf could collapse within months.

“At that point in time, the glaciers will react,” said Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at the University of California, Irvine, who has done extensive research on polar ice. “If the ice shelf breaks apart, it will remove a buttressing force on the glaciers that flow into it. The glaciers will feel less resistance to flow, effectively removing a cork in front of them.”

Scientists also fear that two crucial anchor points will be lost.
According to Dr. Rignot, the stability of the whole ice shelf is threatened, as the shelf front thins.

“You have these two anchors on the side of Larsen C that play a critical role in holding the ice shelf where it is,” he said. “If the shelf is getting thinner, it will be more breakable, and it will lose contact with the ice rises.”

Ice rises are islands that are overridden by the ice shelf, allowing them to shoulder more of the weight of the shelf. Scientists have yet to determine the extent of thinning around the Bawden and Gipps ice rises, though Dr. Rignot noted that the Bawden ice rise was more vulnerable.

“We’re not even sure how it’s hanging on there,” he said. “But if you take away Bawden, the whole shelf will feel it.”

The Antarctic Peninsula may be a canary in a coal mine.
The collapse of the peninsula’s ice shelves can be interpreted as fulfilling a prophecy made in 1978 by a renowned geologist named John H. Mercer of Ohio State University. In a classic paper, Dr. Mercer warned that the western part of Antarctica was so vulnerable to human-induced climate warming as to pose a “threat of disaster” from rising seas.

He said that humanity would know the calamity had begun when ice shelves started breaking up along the peninsula, with the breakups moving progressively southward.

The Larsen A ice shelf broke up over several years starting in 1995; the Larsen B underwent a dramatic collapse in 2002; and now, scientists fear, the calving of the giant iceberg could be the first stage in the breakup of Larsen C.

“As climate warming progresses farther south,” Dr. Rignot said, “it will affect larger and larger ice shelves, holding back bigger and bigger glaciers, so that their collapse will contribute more to sea-level rise.”",very_high,"Accurate, Insightful",11,"This July 2017 article in The New York Times described a remarkable iceberg calving event at Antarctica’s Larsen C ice shelf.

","Well-written article with fabulous graphics for illustrating and explaining rift growth and the 2017 calving event on Larsen C. It correctly highlights future concerns about the potential loss of backstress from key ice rises on the ice shelf (Bawden and Gipps) and the idea that this is a “natural laboratory to study how breakups will occur at other ice shelves.” Further, the article does a nice job explaining how ice shelves provide backstress to upstream glaciers, and why their loss would spell increased ice discharge/sea level rise.

However, some statements in the article are misleading, such as:

i) “Larsen C, like two smaller ice shelves that collapsed before it, was holding back relatively little land ice….” Larsen C has calved a large iceberg but has NOT collapsed.

ii) Rift growth and iceberg calving is not simply connected to atmospheric temperatures (like how surface mass balance processes are, but rather fracture growth is responding to glaciological stresses), hence it is somewhat misleading to make this connection “but scientists believe the ice is still catching up to the higher temperatures.” There are certainly ways that this calving event could be connected to say warmer ocean temperatures that increased basal melting and changed the structure of the ice shelf, but this has not been documented at present.

New York Times accurately covers 2017 record low Arctic winter sea ice extent,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-accurately-covers-2017-record-low-arctic-winter-sea-ice-extent-henry-fountain/,Arctic’s Winter Sea Ice Drops to Its Lowest Recorded Level,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/climate/arctic-winter-sea-ice-record-low-global-warming.html,"After a season that saw temperatures soar at the North Pole, the Arctic has less sea ice at winter’s end than ever before in nearly four decades of satellite measurements.

The extent of ice cover — a record low for the third straight year — is another indicator of the effects of global warming on the Arctic, a region that is among the hardest hit by climate change, scientists said.

“This is just another exclamation point on the overall loss of Arctic sea ice coverage that we’ve been seeing,” said Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a government-backed research agency in Boulder, Colo. “We’re heading for summers with no sea ice coverage at all.”

Dr. Serreze said that such a situation, which would leave nothing but open ocean in summer until fall freeze-up begins, could occur by 2030, although many scientists say it may not happen for a decade or two after that.

The melting of sea ice does not raise sea levels, but loss of ice coverage can disrupt ecosystems. For example, it can affect the timing of blooms of phytoplankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain.

Less ice coverage also means that there is more dark ocean to absorb more of the sun’s energy, which leads to more warming and melting in a feedback loop called Arctic amplification.

The data center said on Wednesday that sea ice in the Arctic had reached maximum extent, of about 5.5 million square miles, on March 7. That is an area nearly twice the size of Australia, but about 470,000 square miles less than the average maximum from 1981 to 2010.

Much of the ice also appears to be thinner than normal, Dr. Serreze said, another result of the unusually warm temperatures in the Arctic this winter.

Late last fall, parts of the Arctic were more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than observed averages, and at the pole itself, mean temperatures for November were 23 degrees above normal. There were similar temperature spikes in December and this year.

“The Arctic Ocean was extremely warm over the winter, and there was a very impressive series of heat waves,” Dr. Serreze said. “I’ve never seen anything like this before.”

Less coverage and thinner ice mean that this summer’s minimum, which is expected to occur in September, is likely to be low. But there is no direct link between the maximum in March and the minimum after the melting season, said Walt Meier, a research scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory.

“Just because it’s a record low maximum, there’s no prediction it will be a record low minimum in September,” Dr. Meier said. “But while a lot can happen in the summer, when you start out at such a low level, you’re not going to get a very high minimum.”

Dr. Meier said that in addition to the low overall ice extent, some parts of the Arctic were almost completely devoid of ice this winter, including the Barents Sea off Norway and Russia.

“We haven’t seen much there at all,” he said, “and what there is will melt very quickly.”",high,"Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",9,"This March 2017 story in the New York Times described the record low extent of Arctic sea ice at its annual maximum.

This is not made clear in the article and is an important distinction.","Nathanael Melia, Postdoctoral research fellow, University of Reading","Both of the scientists interviewed are highly respected in their field and are from world leading institutions in polar research.

Conservative Tribune post falsely claims cancelled Arctic research cruise is evidence against climate change,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/conservative-tribune-post-falsely-claims-cancelled-arctic-research-cruise-is-evidence-against-climate-change-benjamin-arie/,Global Warming Study Canceled After Humiliating Discovery,https://conservativetribune.com/global-warming-study-cancelled/,"You can say this for bleeding-heart liberals: They certainly have a flair for the ironic.

An expedition designed to gather evidence of global warming and “climate change” in the Arctic was canceled last month after a humiliating discovery was made: There was so much ice in the Arctic that the icebreaker it was going to use was needed elsewhere.

Yes, you read that right. It’s the return of left-leaning scientists’ famous nemesis, “Reality.” And this time it affected plans for the research vessel Amundsen, which can be redirected by the Canadian Coast Guard if its icebreaking capabilities are required to clear lanes for fishing boats or supply vessels, such as oil tankers, according to the Winnipeg Free Press.


“The Science Team of the Canadian Research Icebreaker CCGS Amundsen has cancelled the first leg of the 2017 Expedition due to complications associated with the southward motion of hazardous Arctic sea ice,” the news site Science Daily reported.

Keep in mind that the Amundsen is no lightweight ship. “It’s the second most powerful icebreaker in the country and we had trouble getting through the sea ice,” David Barber, an arctic research expert, told the Free Press.

The mission wasn’t exactly cheap, either. “Timing was key for this $17 million, four-year, University of Manitoba-led project,” Science Daily explained. “The need to deal with extreme ice conditions in the south meant the ship would arrive too late on site to meet research objectives.”

Scientists connected to the planned mission stated in no uncertain terms that they had not expected the heavy ice to be present.

“It became clear to me very quickly that these weren’t just heavy ice conditions, these were unprecedented ice conditions,” Dr. David Barber, the lead scientist on the study, admitted to Vice Magazine.

“We were finding thick multi-year sea ice floes which on level ice were five meters thick … it was much, much thicker and much, much heavier than anything you would expect at that latitude and at that time of year,” he continued.


It isn’t the first time a global warming study has been ironically halted in its tracks.

“There was the Ship of Fools expedition in which an Australian climate researcher called Chris Turkey had to call an expedition to the melting Antarctic after his ship got stuck in the ice,” recalled Breitbart News contributor James Delingpole.

“The Caitlin Expedition – supported by the Prince of Wales – in which Pen Haddow and his team had to abandon their trip to the North Pole because it was colder than they’d expected,” he continued.

“Most recently there was Ship of Fools II, in which a global warming research voyage by David Hempleman Adams had to be curtailed because of unexpected ice.”

Have you noticed a trend?

The problem with the proponents of man-made climate change theories isn’t that they might be wrong. The real issue is the arrogance and zealotry found in people who see science not as an ongoing process, but as a religion.

There is a difference between science and “scientism.” It isn’t an all-knowing oracle that is absolutely right all of the time. In fact, theories and explanations must frequently be wrong if science is properly advancing.

The simple fact is, humans know very little about the climate cycles of our world. Recognizing that skepticism and asking challenging questions are part of good science, yet climate change radicals have made their politically fueled narrative more important than the truth.

It looks like the Arctic Ocean missed the memo and isn’t playing along with the liberal talking points. Reality has a way of being very persistent — and that’s something leftists still haven’t figured out.
",low,"Biased, Cherry-picking, Derogatory, Misleading",9,"In June 2017, an Arctic research cruise had to be postponed because of unusually thick sea ice that had drifted near Newfoundland. Polar field work frequently battles difficult conditions, but several outlets wrote derisive articles (analyzed by Climate Feedback at the time) based on the assumption that such conditions would no longer exist if climate change were really occurring.

Scientists who reviewed a post on this topic at Conservative Tribune explained that a number of incorrect assumptions underlie its argument against the validity of climate science. Climate scientists have never predicted that these sea ice conditions will not occur. In fact, the drifting of thick sea ice as far south as Newfoundland could be related to the thinning and loss of sea ice nearer the pole.
",,,,,"Twila Moon, Research Scientist, University of Colorado, Boulder","There is no understanding in this article of the difference between weather (day-to-day or year-to-year variability) and climate (long-term, multi-decade behavior). The author takes advantage of this confusion, and even adds to it, drawing false implications about the scientific method and scientists’ skill.

","Nathanael Melia, Postdoctoral research fellow, University of Reading","There is no science in this article, just some factual statements about an event linked to an agenda driven narrative. The reason un-navigable multi-year ice was found at these locations is because a reduced ice-pack in general allows the multi-year ice to drift from locations where it is historically kept anchored to. June is halfway between the sea ice max and min so these conditions are unsurprising. Polar expeditions are routinely hampered by the seasonal and weekly weather events, it’s part of the reason an ice-breaker was planned to be used in the first place.

","Kelly McCusker, Research Associate, Rhodium Group and Climate Impact Lab","Repeating a version of a debunked argument against climate change science, this biased and misleading political article states that the cancellation of an Arctic research cruise due to increased sea ice at one time and in one region proves climate scientists don’t know anything about climate change over 100 years, which is patently false. The article misrepresents many aspects of our current understanding and is written in a biased manner, using phrases such as “climate change activists [sic] scientists” and “bleeding-heart liberals”.

Climate projections don’t presume to predict exactly what will be happening and where at any given time, but instead describe the average climate (or the statistics of weather).

IFLScience story on Florida sea level rise somewhat unclear but generally correct,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/iflscience-story-florida-sea-level-rise-somewhat-unclear-generally-correct/,The Sea Level Around Florida Is Rising Six Times Faster Than Average,http://www.iflscience.com/environment/the-sea-level-around-florida-is-rising-six-times-faster-than-average/,"It really is hard to overstate how screwed Florida is when it comes to climate change. Sea level rise has already ensured that floods are becoming common, not freak weather extremes; it’s guaranteeing that hurricanes and their associated storm surges are just getting that much more powerful.

Despite all this evidence, however, Governors and Senators who are often climate change deniers still get voted back into power there. As a result, instead of investing in climate change prevention measures, streets in Miami are literally getting raised up off the ground to stop floodwater coming in.

A new study, published in Geophysical Research Letters, suggests that even this ludicrously short-sighted measure won’t be enough to stop the incoming tide. Sea level rise around the globe is accelerating year-on-year, but along the Floridian coastline, it’s rising up three to six times faster than average.

A team of researchers from the University of Florida took into account a wide range of factors when it came to determining why this was happening. After all, regional sea level rise changes are very complex, and no single mechanism is solely to blame.

When it comes to human influence, there are two inputs: the melting ice caps, and thermal expansion. The former is obvious – terrestrial ice that melts, falls into the sea and disintegrates causes the sea level to rise first in the region, and then globally.

The latter relates to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; the more there is, the hotter the planet’s surface gets, and the hotter the oceans get. Warm water expands, and normally the only way to expand is upwards.

When it comes to natural cycles, sea level changes take place on short timescales normally because an oceanic current, one that shifts water from place to place, has changed. El Niño, the epic and all-encompassing climatic phenomenon that takes place every 2-7 years, can affect these oceanic currents.

This new study suggests that Florida’s sea level rise “hot spot” is being caused mostly by these natural factors. A recent, particularly powerful El Niño and a sudden weakening in the atmospheric pressure over the region - thanks to a feature known as the North Atlantic Oscillation - conspired to allow water levels to rise sharply.

“The superposition of these two ocean-atmospheric processes accounts for 87% of the variance in the spatiotemporal pattern of intradecadal sea level oscillations,” the team note – meaning that by far, natural processes are responsible for this unusual hot spot of sea level rise.

It cannot be ignored, though, that human contributions to climate change are only exacerbating this further. All in all, it’s bad news for Florida’s near-future, which is set to be underwater faster than anyone has previously estimated.

Another study revealed that, by 2100, there will be 2 billion climate refugees – and several million of them will be migrating from Florida to places further inland. If that’s not the future you want, it’s probably best to vote for lawmakers who’ll do something about it.","neutral, high",,11,"This story by IFLScience covered an August 2017 study published in Geophysical Research Letters that examined variability of sea level rise rates along the US East Coast.

The original scientific article is linked from the text and the authors clearly distinguish between the variations associated with climate change and the more rapid and localised change associated with modes of internal variability.
However, this distinction between time scales gets lost a bit in the concluding paragraph. The statement that “[Florida] is set to be underwater faster than anyone has previously estimated” is not an accurate representation of the concluding remarks from the original scientific paper, which states that “[the impacts of sea level rise] may be further amplified by short-lived [sea level rise] hot spots”.","Andrea Dutton, Visiting Associate Professor, University of Wisconsin","[Prof. Dutton was one of the authors of the study described in this article.]

New York Times’ news coverage of 2016 global temperature data was an accurate summary,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-news-coverage-2016-global-temperature-data-accurate-summary-justin-gillis/,Earth Sets a Temperature Record for the Third Straight Year,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/science/earth-highest-temperature-record.html,"Marking another milestone for a changing planet, scientists reported on Wednesday that the Earth reached its highest temperature on record in 2016, trouncing a record set only a year earlier, which beat one set in 2014. It is the first time in the modern era of global warming data that temperatures have blown past the previous record three years in a row.

The findings come two days before the inauguration of an American president who has called global warming a Chinese plot and vowed to roll back his predecessor’s efforts to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases.

In reality, the Earth is heating up, a point long beyond serious scientific dispute, but one becoming more evident as the records keep falling. Temperatures are heading toward levels that many experts believe will pose a profound threat to both the natural world and to human civilization.

In 2015 and 2016, the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El Niño, in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere. But the bigger factor in setting the records was the long-term trend of rising temperatures, which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

“A single warm year is something of a curiosity,” said Deke Arndt, chief of global climate monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “It’s really the trend, and the fact that we’re punching at the ceiling every year now, that is the real indicator that we’re undergoing big changes.”

The heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic, with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean. Sea ice in that region has been in precipitous decline for years, and Arctic communities are already wrestling with enormous problems, such as rapid coastal erosion, caused by the changing climate.

“What’s going on in the Arctic is really very impressive; this year was ridiculously off the chart,” said Gavin A. Schmidt, head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, a unit of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that tracks global temperatures.

But Arctic people were hardly alone in feeling the heat. Drought and starvation afflicted Africa. On May 19, the people in the town of Phalodi lived through the hottest day in the recorded history of India, 123.8 degrees Fahrenheit.

El Niño has now ended, and climate scientists almost universally expect 2017 to be cooler than the year before. But the scale of the heat burst has been startling to many of the experts, and some of them fear an accelerated era of global warming could be at hand over the next few years.

Even at current temperatures, billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean. The sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions. Those factors are causing the ocean to rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace, and coastal communities in the United States are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding. Their pleas for help from Congress have largely been ignored.

The finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on Wednesday by three government agencies, two of them American and one British, that track measurements made by ships, buoys and land-based weather stations. They analyze the figures to correct for known problems, producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the Earth. The national meteorological agency of Japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis.

In the British data set, 2016 set a record by only a small amount; the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA’s. NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures, and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason.

NASA’s calculations suggested that the planet had warmed by well over a half-degree Fahrenheit from 2013 to 2016. That is a huge change for the surface of an entire planet to undergo in just three years, and it appears to be the largest temperature increase over a three-year period in the NASA record, which begins in 1880.

The findings about a record-warm year were also confirmed by the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments. That group, however, did not find that three records had been set in a row; in its analysis, 2010 was slightly warmer than 2014.

In addition to the surface measurements, satellites are used to measure the temperature of the atmosphere within a few miles of the surface. Two groups that analyze these figures showed a record-warm 2016 in data going back to 1978, though in one data set it was a record by only a small margin.

Since 1880, NOAA’s records show only one other instance when global temperature records were set three years in a row: in 1939, 1940 and 1941. The Earth has warmed so much in recent decades, however, that 1941 now ranks as only the 37th-warmest year on record.

The modern era of global warming began around 1970, after a long stretch of relatively flat temperatures, and the past three years mark the first time in that period that three records were set in a row. Of the 17 hottest years on record, 16 have now occurred since 2000.

Two of the agencies that issued Wednesday’s figures, NOAA and NASA, will soon report to cabinet secretaries appointed by President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has expressed doubt about the findings of climate science. In 2012, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.”

Fear has erupted within the agencies about whether their data will now be subject to political manipulation. Mr. Trump and his cabinet nominees have given no detailed indication of what their broad climate policies are likely to be, much less how they will manage the scientific enterprise of monitoring the climate.

Since he was elected president, Mr. Trump has acknowledged there may be “some connectivity” between human activity and climate change, and he promised to keep an open mind on the subject.

On Wednesday, in questioning before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Mr. Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, said, “I do not believe that climate change is a hoax.” He did not, however, say whether he believed that Mr. Trump was wrong on climate change.

The three record-setting years in a row undercut longstanding claims by a handful of contrarian scientists that global warming stopped after 1998. That argument was never backed by good statistical evidence, but it was highlighted repeatedly in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail in 2016.

When the heat buildup in the ocean is taken into account, global temperatures are rising relentlessly. Scientists have calculated that the heat accumulating throughout the Earth because of human emissions is roughly equal to the energy that would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs exploding across the planet every day.

It is true that at the Earth’s surface, the warming seems to be proceeding in fits and starts. “The arc of global warming will be variously steep and less steep,” said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. “It never stopped.”

In fact, the rate over time has been reasonably close to predictions that scientists first offered decades ago. Those same scientists have long warned that humanity is courting disaster by failing to bring fossil-fuel emissions under control.

For example, many experts on sea level believe that a rise of 15 or 20 feet has already become inevitable, though they cannot say how fast it will happen. A rise that large would drown most of the world’s coastal cities without heroic efforts to fortify them.",very_high,"Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",14,"In January 2017, NASA and NOAA released their data for average global temperature in 2016, which ranked as the warmest year on record.

Thus it was very warm in the Arctic. As NASA’s Gavin Schmidt said: “What’s going on in the Arctic is really very impressive; this year was ridiculously off the chart”

But 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit may not be as exceptional as it sounds to our ears.

Futurism story on Great Barrier Reef compromised by sensational headline,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/futurism-story-great-barrier-reef-compromised-sensational-headline/,Scientists Announce That The Great Barrier Reef is Officially “Terminal”,https://futurism.com/scientists-announce-that-the-great-barrier-reef-is-officially-terminal/,"Why care about reefs? In a word—biodiversity. The reef is home to 3,000 varieties of mollusks, over a hundred types of jellyfish, 1,625 species of fish, hundreds of shark and ray species, and over 30 kinds of whales and dolphins. These sea creatures call the soft and hard corals that make up the reef “home.” And without it, many of them will die.

If that’s not enough, it has the distinction of being the largest living structure on the planet.

The Great Barrier Reef is home to 3,000 individual coral reefs stretching across a staggering 2,575 kilometers (1,600 miles), covering an area of about 344,400 square kilometers (133,000 square miles.)

Unfortunately, because of back to back mass bleaching events, scientists are telling us that the massive, impressive Australian Great Barrier Reef is now at a ‘terminal stage’—with large portions having no hope of recovery.

Mass bleaching, a phenomenon caused by global warming, is prompted when the water warms to a point that corals begin ejecting the symbiotic algae in their tissue, essential for their survival. Throughout history, there have only been four instances of this occurrence, and after such an event, it will take decades to recover.

“This is the fourth time the Great Barrier Reef has bleached severely – in 1998, 2002, 2016, and now in 2017. Bleached corals are not necessarily dead corals, but in the severe central region we anticipate high levels of coral loss,” said researcher James Kerry, from James Cook University’s ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, in an official statement. He clarifies why the 2017 bleaching is significant: “It takes at least a decade for a full recovery of even the fastest growing corals, so mass bleaching events 12 months apart offers zero prospect of recovery for reefs that were damaged in 2016.”

DEATH TOLL
The newest aerial surveys covered over 8,000 kilometers (5,000) miles, which includes 800 individual coral reefs.

According to the surveys, 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) of the Great Barrier Reef is now bleached. These new statistics come less than a year after 93 percent of the reef suffered severe damage, with reports adding that the effects have also spread further south.

Combined with the mass bleaching event, the arrival of Tropical Cyclone Debbie added to the devastation, as it struck a section of the reef that managed to escape the worst of the bleaching.

In an interview with The Guardian, scientists note just how dire the situation is. “We’ve given up,” said Jon Brodie, a James Cook University water quality expert, who was referring to inaction on the part of the Australian government. “It’s been my life managing water quality, we’ve failed.”

Unfortunately, in this age of global warming, temperatures are expected to continue rising, which means more of these bleaching events will happen, and they will cause even more damage. And the reality is, this could be the last generation who will get to see the grand beauty of this reef.

Fortunately, it’s not too late for us to save the rest of the planet from the worst effects of climate change. But we must act now.","neutral, low",Misleading,3,"This April 2017 story at Futurism describes a statement released by James Cook University’s ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies on bleaching along Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Bleaching occurs when corals are exposed to excessively warm water.

In doing so, however, it is forced into some generalizations including i) describing the Great Barrier Reef as a single entity that can “die” (rather than a complex web of ecosystems that will experience widespread degradation) and ii) stating there have been only four instances of mass bleaching (there have been thousands of events across the world over the past three decades, yet only four years where bleaching occurred in all ocean basins).","Mark Eakin, Scientist, Coordinator of NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","Much of the story is factually correct. However, the declaration of the reef as “terminal” in the title is a very bad start. What could have been a good story is dragged down by the use of terms like “terminal” without attribution, confuses no time for recovery between back-to-back events with no hope for recovery in the future, and uses a quote saying an expert has “given up” from the perspective of insufficient government action on water quality without providing context for how this relates to a story that is focused on global warming and bleaching.

Breitbart article on California fires misleads by omitting explanation of climate’s influence,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-california-fires-misleads-omitting-explanation-climates-influence-joel-pollak/,Jerry Brown Blames Climate Change for California Fires: ‘The New Normal’,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/12/09/jerry-brown-blames-climate-change-california-fires-new-normal/,"California Governor Jerry Brown blamed climate change for the California fires that have devastated the state this fall during a visit to assess the damage in Ventura County on Saturday.

“This is the new normal,” he said, as quoted by the Orange County Register. “We’re facing a new reality where fires threaten peoples’ lives, their properties, their neighborhoods and cost billions and billions of dollars. We have to have the resources to combat the fires, and also have to invest in managing our vegetation and forests and all the ways we dwell in this very wonderful place — but a place that’s getting hotter.”

However, climate scientists are more skeptical, noting that climate change could be one of a variety of factors.

A comprehensive look at the question by Southern California Public Radio — hardly a conservative outlet — found that there was considerable debate about the factors that made this year’s fires particularly bad.

One factor was high winds, whose connection to climate change is “still up for debate.” Another factor was the state’s recent drought, which persisted in the part of Southern California where the Thomas fire — now in excess of 150,000 acres, with only 15% containment — struck. (Ironically, last winter’s heavy rains caused brush to grow rapidly, giving fires plenty of fuel to burn.)

An important factor in the fires of the past week was that people are building homes in areas that are naturally prone to wildfires, or where naturally dry conditions mean that the kinds of building materials and vegetation that people prefer to use in cities and suburbs are a fire hazard.

Brown has frequently cited climate change as the cause for natural disasters before, only to be corrected by scientists, who suggested he was guilty of “noble-cause corruption” — i.e. distorting science in service of a cause that many scientists support.

Last year, both Brown and then-President Barack Obama falsely linked wildfires across the western United States to climate change. And last month, Brown told a conference at the Vatican that the world needed “brain washing” on climate change.

Aside from the Thomas fire, firefighters have made significant progress in their struggle against some of the other fires burning across the region. The Skirball fire near the 405 Freeway, which brought traffic to a standstill in Los Angeles on Thursday, was at 75 percent containment as of Saturday afternoon, according to Southern California Public Radio. The Lilac fire, which killed several dozen horses on Thursday, was fully contained by Saturday evening, according to the Register.

“The Creek Fire was now 80% contained, and the Rye Fire was 65% contained” as of Saturday, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Officials say there have been no deaths associated with the Southern California fires.",very_low,"Biased, Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Misleading",94,"This article in Breitbart criticizes a statement by California Governor Jerry Brown, who said that the recent dangerous fires are “the new normal” for the area. The article correctly lists a number of factors that contribute to wildfires, including weather patterns and the construction of homes in areas at risk of fire. The article represents the contribution of climate change to wildfire trends as unknown, and a matter of debate for climate scientists.

Scientists who reviewed the story found this to be misleading. The article fails to explain the ways in which climate change can clearly influence the factors that control wildfires. A number of published studies have found that climate change is an important contributing factor to wildfire behavior in the western United States.
",,,,,"Anthony LeRoy Westerling, Associate Professor, University of California, Merced","The article ignores the overwhelming evidence in peer reviewed scientific literature that warmer temperatures and more variable precipitation are exacerbating western US wildfire activity, leading to more large fires, more area burned, changing fire severity, and longer fire seasons. While many other factors interact with climate to influence wildfire, a changing climate is clearly driving an increase in fire risk. The fact that other factors influence wildfire does not imply that climate has no effect on wildfire.","Logan Berner, Assistant Research Professor, Northern Arizona University","The Breitbart article provides a poorly reasoned and misleading view of how climate change has contributed to recent fires in California and the rest of the western USA. The most informative part of the article is the link that it provides to a piece by Southern California Public Radio, which, unlike the Breitbart article, provides an informative and unbiased look at factors contributing to these recent fires.

","Stefan Doerr, Professor, Swansea University","The article is factually correct with no significant inaccuracies. Indeed no specific wildfire event can be specifically linked to climate change as the main cause. The article correctly states that “climate change could be one of a variety of factors”.

It also correctly states that “an important factor […] was that people are building homes in areas that are naturally prone to wildfires, or where naturally dry conditions mean that the kinds of building materials and vegetation [used] are a fire hazard.

This, however, is only one of many factors. Climate is not discussed further and it would have been more balanced if the article had also highlighted that climate scientists (i) have shown that the fire season in the southwest USA has lengthened considerably and (ii) generally agree that climate warming increases the probability of the occurrence of large fires in California (as well as many other regions of the world).

See for example:

Westerling (2016) Increasing western US forest wildfire activity: sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B
Doerr and Santin (2016) Global trends in wildfire and its impacts: perceptions versus realities in a changing world, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B
","Daniel Swain, Climate Scientist, University of California, Los Angeles","This article mixes several true statements with a much larger number of demonstrably false assertions, yielding a very misleading piece overall.

While it is true that potential links between climate change and the strength/magnitude of Santa Ana winds themselves remain uncertain, links between warming temperatures and drying vegetation (and therefore wildfire risk) have been extensively demonstrated. Autumn 2017 was the warmest and second driest such period on record in coastal Southern California—which has yielded explosive fire conditions that both the National Weather Service and state/local fire agencies have confirmed are the most severe on record for this time of year.

Recent studies suggest that further warming and vegetation drying due to climate change will likely increase the amount of area burned by wildfire in southwestern California, even absent changes in the strength of Santa Ana winds. An even clearer link already exists between warming temperatures and increasing wildfire risk more broadly across the American West.

","Ben Poulter, Research Scientist, NASA","One only has to read the links in the article to understand that climate change is the underlying driver of the unusually intense 2017 winter fires that are impacting both the people and places of Southern California. Wildfires result from complex interactions between ignitions, fuel availability, and weather, and after accounting for the role of people and management, climate change has been shown to affect and exacerbate all three.

"Daily Caller uncritically reports poorly supported conclusion of satellite temperature study
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/daily-caller-uncritically-reports-misleading-satellite-temperature-study-michael-bastasch/,STUDY: Satellites Show No Acceleration In Global Warming For 23 Years,http://dailycaller.com/2017/11/29/study-satellites-show-no-acceleration-in-global-warming-for-23-years/,"Global warming has not accelerated temperature rise in the bulk atmosphere in more than two decades, according to a new study funded by the Department of Energy.

University of Alabama-Huntsville climate scientists John Christy and Richard McNider found that by removing the climate effects of volcanic eruptions early on in the satellite temperature record it showed virtually no change in the rate of warming since the early 1990s.

“We indicated 23 years ago — in our 1994 Nature article — that climate models had the atmosphere’s sensitivity to CO2 much too high,” Christy said in a statement. “This recent paper bolsters that conclusion.”

Christy and McNider found the rate of warming has been 0.096 degrees Celsius per decade after “the removal of volcanic cooling in the early part of the record,” which “is essentially the same value we determined in 1994 … using only 15 years of data.”

The study is sure to be contentious. Christy has argued for years that climate models exaggerate global warming in the bulk atmosphere, which satellites have monitored since the late 1970s.

Christy, a noted skeptic of catastrophic man-made global warming, said his results reinforce his claim that climate models predict too much warming in the troposphere, the lowest five miles of the atmosphere. Models are too sensitive to increases in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, he said.

“From our observations we calculated that value as 1.1 C (almost 2° Fahrenheit), while climate models estimate that value as 2.3 C (about 4.1° F),” Christy said.

While many scientists have acknowledged the mismatch between model predictions and actual temperature observations, few have really challenged the validity of the models themselves.

A recent study led by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory climate scientist Ben Santer found that while the models ran hot, the “overestimation” was “partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations.”

Christy’s removal of volcanic-driven cooling from satellite temperature data could also draw scrutiny. The study also removed El Nino and La Nina cycles, which are particularly pronounced in satellite records, but those cycles largely canceled each other out, the co-authors said.

Christy said his works shows the “climate models need to be retooled to better reflect conditions in the actual climate, while policies based on previous climate model output and predictions might need to be reconsidered.”

Two major volcanoes — El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991 — caused global average temperature to dip as a result of volcanic ash, soot and debris reflecting sunlight back into space.

Those eruptions meant there was more subsequent warming in the following years, making the rate of warming appear to be rising as a result of man-made emissions or other factors, Christy said.

“Those eruptions happened relatively early in our study period, which pushed down temperatures in the first part of the dataset, which caused the overall record to show an exaggerated warming trend,” Christy said.

“While volcanic eruptions are natural events, it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend. If the same eruptions had happened near the more recent end of the dataset, they could have pushed the overall trend into negative numbers, or a long-term cooling,” Christy said.",low,"Cherry-picking, Misleading",80,"This article in The Daily Caller describes a recent study published on the University of Alabama at Huntsville satellite temperature dataset. The study claims that, after removing the cooling influence of two large volcanic eruptions in 1982 and 1991, the rate of warming is slower than simulated by climate models.

While The Daily Caller story accurately describes the study, it fails to include comments from other scientists in the field or to provide necessary context for readers, as the scientists who reviewed the story explained. For example, the study fails to account for more recent volcanic activity, and does not support its conclusion that climate models are overly sensitive to CO2.

In addition, the story’s headline emphasizes that the study shows “no acceleration in global warming for 23 years” and this is presented as a challenge to model simulations. This is misleading, as no acceleration of the warming rate is expected to be seen in such a short timeframe.
",,,,,"Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University","This article reports on a new study by Christy and McNider that, in my view, contains little new regarding atmospheric temperature trends and seems to simply assert that model-observation discrepancies are due to model errors. Also, it seems the absence of accelerating warming trends is meant to go against prevailing climate science, but I find that to be a strawman argument.

In that sense the article is misleading—however, to its credit, it does report on other published results that contradict this recent study, but it fails to provide further context or to make any effort to compare/reconcile the validity of these different studies.

","Stephen Po-Chedley, Research Scientist, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory:","The article includes many points made in the original study, but leaves out or de-emphasizes issues that are important to the interpretation of the results. Other factors contribute to model-observational differences in atmospheric warming, but the presentation makes it seem like the difference is largely a result of climate model sensitivity errors.","Francois-Marie Breon, Senior Scientist, Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique","The general public article provides a fairly accurate summary of the John Christy paper. It may lack some information about the general context, and could have emphasized some of the uncertainties in the satellite data and the fact that the temperature analysis refers to rather high atmospheric levels rather than the low levels where humans live.

I also note that, a few years back, the skeptics said that the warming had “stopped” whereas they now say that there is “no acceleration”. This is a nice progress towards the truth.

","Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany","The article contains some inaccuracies, but the main problem is that it depends on only one source, which the article admits is “contentious”. The authors have a long tradition of overconfidence in their data, their dataset has often needed large adjustments and has a large structural uncertainty and the study was published in a low-level journal. Even without these red flags, it is a good tradition in science reporting to ask experts in the field for their assessment of the study and to provide context, which is completely missing. Bad journalism.

","Carl Mears, Senior Research Scientist, Remote Sensing Systems (RSS)","The article does an adequate job of describing the Christy and McNider paper, but leaves out discussion of several assumptions, caveats, and alternative explanations in the original paper. In particular, both the article and the original paper ignore the contribution of small but important volcanic eruptions in the 21st century that have been shown to exhibit a cooling influence on tropospheric temperatures after 2000.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,“STUDY: Satellites Show No Acceleration In Global Warming For 23 Years”,"The article leaves out several assumptions, caveats, and alternative explanations, some of which are described in the original paper.

1. Both the article and the original paper ignore the effects of smaller but important eruptions in the 21st century that cause
a cooling effects that is not included in the model forcings. These have been shown to have a significant effect on the post-2000 trends1,2.

The original paper brushes these later eruptions aside without discussing why their results might differ from the earlier Santer et al. results. By then fitting to a model that includes
only the earlier eruptions, a decrease in overall warming is guaranteed in their analysis.

2. In the original paper, the authors rightly discuss the possibility that more heat has been sequestered into the ocean in “real life” than is simulated by the models. This is likely the case because of the increase in oceanic windspeed (and thus ocean mixing) in the tropics over the last few decades that is not generally present in the model results. In the article, only the sensitivity to carbon dioxide is discussed, supported by a quote from Dr. Christy. Blaming any model/measurement discrepancy on one possible cause, CO2 sensitivity, that has a large effect on the multidecadal time scale, while ignoring other possible causes, such as smaller volcanoes or internal variability) that may average out on the long term is “cherry picking”. This is done in the article, and to a smaller degree in the original paper.

3. The original paper make an admittedly bold assumption (as noted in the paper) that internal variability can be ignored while calculating transient sensitivity to increasing carbon dioxide.
The leads to less uncertainty in the derived transient sensitivity results than can likely be justified. No discussion of this assumption appears in the article.

4. Both the article and the original paper fail to place the new results in context of other diagnostics of global warming. These include surface temperature (which is likely more precisely measured and certainly has a longer measurement record) and ocean heat content (which is likely where at least a portion of the missing heat has gone).

","The study was actually about satellite estimates of the upper air temperature for the much longer period January 1979 – June 2017.

It is possible to see an acceleration of the warming over the last century. In the graph below showing three well-known temperature change estimates based on the surface air temperature observations the warming is clearly smaller around 1900 than it is around 2000. In other words the warming has accelerated.
",,,"“Global warming has not accelerated temperature rise in the bulk atmosphere in more than two decades”
","This is not a particularly new result. It has long been known that warming has not accelerated in the observations in the last decade. Although this is well-documented in the surface record, it has also been noted in the satellite record as well.

","This is not a new finding. As the article itself mentions, this has been shown in previous studies.

Also, this (and the title) makes it sound as though the expectation was too find accelerating trends in atmospheric temperatures (and thus that the “alarmists” are wrong), but I don’t believe this is the case over a relatively short time-span such as the one in this study (30-40 yrs).",,,"“We indicated 23 years ago — in our 1994 Nature article — that climate models had the atmosphere’s sensitivity to CO2 much too high,” Christy said in a statement. “This recent paper bolsters that conclusion.”","This 23 years is likely where the mistake in the title comes from.

Although the data in this Christy and McNider article from 1994 turned out to have major errors, for example not taking into account that the satellites drift, which caused the underestimation of the warming, it started the tradition of Christy and McNider being overconfident about the reliability of their data (“perhaps the best measurements of the Earth’s air temperature in terms of its global coverage and precision.”). And the tradition of immediately blaming climate models, ignoring many other independent lines of evidence on warming and climate sensitivity, when there can be many other reasons for the difference between their data and climate models.

In this 1994 paper, Christy and McNider’s data showed almost no warming. In that respect one could say that 23 years of removing errors from the satellite temperature data has accelerated upper air warming.

","One curious aspect of this statement is that the trend in over the first 15 years (1979 – 1993) is seemingly taken from a much older version of the UAH satellite lower tropospheric temperature dataset. This dataset has since been improved as inhomogeneities have been discovered and corrected, including satellite orbital decay, an error in the diurnal correction, and a miscalibration of the NOAA-9 satellite. Each of these issues would have spuriously reduced the trend in the UAH dataset—presumably if this specific result were revisited models and satellites would agree much better over 1979 – 1993.

","While others have documented differences in the rate of warming between models and observations, this study is different in that the authors suggest that these differences are because models are too sensitive to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Several studies disagree with this assessment in both the surface and atmospheric record.

Other factors contribute to this apparent discrepancy (and some are noted in the original study). These include the potential for observational biases, errors in external forcing prescribed to the models, and real world multidecadal climate variability. So the attribution of model-observational differences predominantly to models is not supported.

","This claim is not substantiated by the study. There are several hypotheses to explain why model trends and observations do not agree—internal variability, errors in forcings, model error. Mr. Christy favors the last one, but, as far as I can tell, his study makes no effort to analyse the plausibility of different causes (in fact, it seems they explicitly assume that internal variability and forcing error are not a cause). The other study cited in this piece, Ben Santer’s paper, goes much further and actually tries to evaluate the plausibility of each hypothesis -and, as the article mentions, comes to different conclusions.

Note also that surface warming in models is in agreement with observations. The question is then why atmospheric warming seems to not be—the models appear to run a little warm there over the last two decades.",,"“climate models predict too much warming in the troposphere”

","One issue with such comparisons is that the observational record of atmospheric warming is quite uncertain as evidenced by the large trend differences between different groups that create satellite temperature datasets and even between versions of each group’s datasets.

","This is right—models have the wrong “external forcings” (such as volcanic forcing), which is likely an important factor in model-observational differences.

It is also possible that errors in removing volcanic forcing and natural variability could also affect model-observational comparisons.

"Grist article on an “Ice Apocalypse” mostly accurate, but doesn’t make the likelihood of that apocalypse clear enough to readers",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/antarctica-doomsday-glaciers-could-flood-coastal-cities-grist-eric-holthaus/,Ice Apocalypse,https://grist.org/article/antarctica-doomsday-glaciers-could-flood-coastal-cities/,"In a remote region of Antarctica known as Pine Island Bay, 2,500 miles from the tip of South America, two glaciers hold human civilization hostage.

Stretching across a frozen plain more than 150 miles long, these glaciers, named Pine Island and Thwaites, have marched steadily for millennia toward the Amundsen Sea, part of the vast Southern Ocean. Further inland, the glaciers widen into a two-mile-thick reserve of ice covering an area the size of Texas.

There’s no doubt this ice will melt as the world warms. The vital question is when.

The glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest-melting in Antarctica. (A Rolling Stone feature earlier this year dubbed Thwaites “The Doomsday Glacier.”) Together, they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea-level rise into the world’s oceans — an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet. For that reason, finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today.

To figure that out, scientists have been looking back to the end of the last ice age, about 11,000 years ago, when global temperatures stood at roughly their current levels. The bad news? There’s growing evidence that the Pine Island Bay glaciers collapsed rapidly back then, flooding the world’s coastlines — partially the result of something called “marine ice-cliff instability.”

The ocean floor gets deeper toward the center of this part of Antarctica, so each new iceberg that breaks away exposes taller and taller cliffs. Ice gets so heavy that these taller cliffs can’t support their own weight. Once they start to crumble, the destruction would be unstoppable.

“Ice is only so strong, so it will collapse if these cliffs reach a certain height,” explains Kristin Poinar, a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “We need to know how fast it’s going to happen.”

In the past few years, scientists have identified marine ice-cliff instability as a feedback loop that could kickstart the disintegration of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet this century — much more quickly than previously thought.

Minute-by-minute, huge skyscraper-sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea, as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building. The result: a global catastrophe the likes of which we’ve never seen.

Ice comes in many forms, with different consequences when it melts. Floating ice, like the kind that covers the Arctic Ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelves, doesn’t raise sea levels. (Think of a melting ice cube, which won’t cause a drink to spill over.)

Land-based ice, on the other hand, is much more troublesome. When it falls into the ocean, it adds to the overall volume of liquid in the seas. Thus, sea-level rise.

Antarctica is a giant landmass — about half the size of Africa — and the ice that covers it averages more than a mile thick. Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance: The snows in the interior of the continent roughly matched the icebergs that broke away from glaciers at its edges.

Now, as carbon dioxide traps more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet, the scales have tipped.

A wholesale collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites would set off a catastrophe. Giant icebergs would stream away from Antarctica like a parade of frozen soldiers. All over the world, high tides would creep higher, slowly burying every shoreline on the planet, flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees.

All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years — much too quickly for humanity to adapt.

“With marine ice cliff instability, sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago,” Poinar says.

A lot of this newfound concern is driven by the research of two climatologists: Rob DeConto at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and David Pollard at Penn State University. A study they published last year was the first to incorporate the latest understanding of marine ice-cliff instability into a continent-scale model of Antarctica.

Their results drove estimates for how high the seas could rise this century sharply higher. “Antarctic model raises prospect of unstoppable ice collapse,” read the headline in the scientific journal Nature, a publication not known for hyperbole.

Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.

Three feet of sea-level rise would be bad, leading to more frequent flooding of U.S. cities such as New Orleans, Houston, New York, and Miami. Pacific Island nations, like the Marshall Islands, would lose most of their territory. Unfortunately, it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios.

At six feet, though, around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced, and the world’s most vulnerable megacities, like Shanghai, Mumbai, and Ho Chi Minh City, could be wiped off the map.

At 11 feet, land currently inhabited by hundreds of millions of people worldwide would wind up underwater. South Florida would be largely uninhabitable; floods on the scale of Hurricane Sandy would strike twice a month in New York and New Jersey, as the tug of the moon alone would be enough to send tidewaters into homes and buildings.

DeConto and Pollard’s breakthrough came from trying to match observations of ancient sea levels at shorelines around the world with current ice sheet behavior.

Around 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were about as warm as they’re expected to be later this century, oceans were dozens of feet higher than today.

Previous models suggested that it would take hundreds or thousands of years for sea-level rise of that magnitude to occur. But once they accounted for marine ice-cliff instability, DeConto and Pollard’s model pointed toward a catastrophe if the world maintains a “business as usual” path — meaning we don’t dramatically reduce carbon emissions.

Rapid cuts in greenhouse gases, however, showed Antarctica remaining almost completely intact for hundreds of years.

Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode.

“It could happen faster or slower, I don’t think we really know yet,” says Jeremy Bassis, a leading ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan. “But it’s within the realm of possibility, and that’s kind of a scary thing.”

Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates. These are, after all, mile-thick chunks of ice.

The new evidence, though, says that once a certain temperature threshold is reached, ice shelves of glaciers that extend into the sea, like those near Pine Island Bay, will begin to melt from both above and below, weakening their structure and hastening their demise, and paving the way for ice-cliff instability to kick in.

In a new study out last month in the journal Nature, a team of scientists from Cambridge and Sweden point to evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor, indicating that Pine Island’s glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age.

The only place in the world where you can see ice-cliff instability in action today is at Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, one of the fastest-collapsing glaciers in the world. DeConto says that to construct their model, they took the collapse rate of Jakobshavn, cut it in half to be extra conservative, then applied it to Thwaites and Pine Island.

But there’s reason to think Thwaites and Pine Island could go even faster than Jakobshavn.

Right now, there’s a floating ice shelf protecting the two glaciers, helping to hold back the flow of ice into the sea. But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too.

“If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,” says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge.

This signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century. “Once the stresses exceed the strength of the ice,” Wise says, “it just falls off.”

And, it’s not just Pine Island Bay. On our current course, other glaciers around Antarctica will be similarly vulnerable. And then there’s Greenland, which could contribute as much as 20 feet of sea-level rise if it melts.

Next to a meteor strike, rapid sea-level rise from collapsing ice cliffs is one of the quickest ways our world can remake itself. This is about as fast as climate change gets.

Still, some scientists aren’t fully convinced the alarm is warranted. Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, says the new research by Wise and his colleagues, which identified ice-cliff instabilities in Pine Island Bay 11,000 years ago, is “tantalizing evidence.” But he says that research doesn’t establish how quickly it happened.

“There’s a whole lot more to understand if we’re going to use this mechanism to predict how far Thwaites glacier and the other glaciers are going to retreat,” he says. “The question boils down to, what are the brakes on this process?”

Scambos thinks it is unlikely that Thwaites or Pine Island would collapse all at once. For one thing, if rapid collapse did happen, it would produce a pile of icebergs that could act like a temporary ice shelf, slowing down the rate of retreat.

Despite the differences of opinion, however, there’s growing agreement within the scientific community that we need to do much more to determine the risk of rapid sea-level rise. In 2015, the U.S. and U.K. governments began to plan a rare and urgent joint research program to study Thwaites glacier. Called “How much, how fast?,” the effort is set to begin early next year and run for five years.

Seeing the two governments pooling their resources is “really a sign of the importance of research like this,” NASA’s Poinar says.

Given what’s at stake, the research program at Thwaites isn’t enough, but it might be the most researchers can get. “Realistically, it’s probably all that can be done in the next five years in the current funding environment,” says Pollard.

He’s referring, of course, to the Trump administration’s disregard for science and adequate scientific funding; the White House’s 2018 budget proposal includes the first-ever cut to the National Science Foundation, which typically funds research in Antarctica.

“It would be sensible to put a huge effort into this, from my perspective,” Pollard says. Structural engineers need to study Antarctica’s key glaciers as though they were analyzing a building, he says, probing for weak spots and understanding how exactly they might fail. “If you vastly increase the research now, [the cost] would still be trivial compared to the losses that might happen.”

Bassis, the ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan, first described the theoretical process of marine ice-cliff instability in research published only a few years ago.

He’s 40 years old, but his field has already changed enormously over the course of his career. In 2002, when Bassis was conducting his PhD research in a different region of Antarctica, he was shocked to return to his base camp and learn that the Larsen B ice shelf had vanished practically overnight.

“Every revision to our understanding has said that ice sheets can change faster than we thought,” he says. “We didn’t predict that Pine Island was going to retreat, we didn’t predict that Larsen B was going to disintegrate. We tend to look at these things after they’ve happened.”

There’s a recurring theme throughout these scientists’ findings in Antarctica: What we do now will determine how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites collapse. A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries. That’s a decision worth countless trillions of dollars and millions of lives.

“The range of outcomes,” Bassis says, “is really going to depend on choices that people make.”",high,"Accurate, Alarmist, Insightful, Sound reasoning",133,"This article at Grist by Eric Holthaus examines the risk of greater sea level rise caused by a more rapid loss of glacial ice.

The two lead authors then continued to investigate the mechanism using computer simulations, publishing a paper in Nature in 20162. The idea of the marine ice-cliff instability is still fairly controversial amongst glaciologists (NOT to be confused with the marine ice sheet instability, which is not controversial and is another reason that West Antarctica is vulnerable to rapid ice loss). A recent paper in Nature3 suggests that there is observational evidence from ancient iceberg tracks, but not all glaciologists are convinced that this new data fully supports the marine ice-cliff instability. Whether the marine ice-cliff instability is something that is likely to occur in Antarctica is still debated amongst scientists.

For a recent look at how our ideas of likely future sea level rise have changed, this is a useful short piece from Science: How high will the seas rise? If marine ice-cliff instability is confirmed as a likely or expected method of Antarctic ice loss then ice loss can occur more quickly than previously thought.","The basic idea is I believe correct—if Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica in the future begins to behave the way Greenland’s ice sheet is now behaving at Jakobshavn, Helheim and some other outlets, the resulting future sea level rise is likely to be notably higher and faster than currently projected by the IPCC. Iceberg calving from non-floating (tidewater) fronts is a widespread and well-known process (passengers on cruise ships to Alaska have been observing it routinely, for example), and the rate of calving is generally accepted to increase in deeper water and to be favored by reduced friction from the sides, for robust physical reasons. The Greenland outlets are in ~1 km deep fjords that are only a few km wide; furthermore, retreat out of these relatively narrow and short fjords would not greatly raise global sea level (most of Greenland’s ice rests on bedrock that is near or above sea level). Retreat of Thwaites Glacier could reach much deeper water with a much wider calving front, and beyond some threshold of retreat is generally modeled as triggering the full deglaciation of the marine basins with ~3 meters of globally averaged sea-level rise, because so much of West Antarctica’s ice rests on interconnected deep beds.

The DeConto-Pollard numbers (and earlier, the Pollard-DeConto-Alley numbers, so note that I was involved with earlier parts of this research) assumed that if triggered, the retreat in West Antarctica would not be as fast as the fastest rates already observed in Greenland (a maximum retreat rate was set in the model); the notably greater sea-level contribution of West Antarctica in the new modeling arises from the much broader calving front that would be activated. But, the greater depth and width of West Antarctica’s deep marine basins than in Greenland could produce much faster calving than in Greenland. Hence, the DeConto-Pollard simulations are not a worst-case scenario.

The uncertainties remain very large, especially regarding the amount of warming to that threshold. But, because tidewater calving is such a widespread process, it is highly likely that warming beyond some threshold will cause tidewater processes to occur in West Antarctica, consistent with the paleo-observations in deglaciated marine areas off Pine Island Bay. Current physical understanding then leads to the expectation of quite rapid sea-level rise. Much work remains to be done to narrow the uncertainties, including analyses of the “mélange” of broken-up icebergs mentioned by Ted Scambos—but note that such a mélange is present in the narrow fjord of Jakobshavn, providing a backstress that has still allowed the rapid retreat observed there. I believe DeConto and Pollard have taken a well-justified path in estimating the warming threshold, but much additional work can be done. Many other models that project smaller future sea-level rise from West Antarctica also lack the transition to tidewater calving. If warming becomes large enough to trigger tidewater processes in West Antarctica (or East Antarctica), then models lacking those processes are not useful for providing either most-likely or worst-case scenarios for sea-level rise.",,,"“‘Antarctic model raises prospect of unstoppable ice collapse,’ read the headline in the scientific journal Nature, a publication not known for hyperbole.”","Good to mention that the same journal published another set of Antarctic sea level rise projections one year before (2015) that are far less dire*.

Ritz et al (2015) Potential sea-level rise from Antarctic ice-sheet instability constrained by observations, Nature",,,,"“Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.”","This timeline represented here is not an accurate representation of the paper’s findings. Figure 4 (below) in the paper is the most helpful. It shows that 11 feet by 2100 in not expected in the tested worst case. However, the paper also addresses sea level rise past 2100. Under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 (the worst case they discussed), the paper suggests sea level rise from Antarctica alone could be 15.65 +/- 2 m by 2500. These numbers are shown in Figure 5 of the Pollard and DeConto Nature paper. A still deeply disturbing finding.","The study referenced1 finds that, assuming some different possible scenarios for the speed of ice sheet processes and the IPCC’s highest emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), Antarctica alone can contribute anywhere from 0.5 to 4.5 feet (Figure 5b and d, below) of sea level rise. The DeConto & Pollard study1 does not include the potential for sea level rise from thermal expansion of sea water, melting of mountain glaciers or the Greenland Ice Sheet in it’s projections, but if these are included, the total sea level rise projected for 2100 may be something like 6 feet. If this is the calculation implicit in this statement that “…six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings”, than it is perhaps a bit misleading, since DeConto & Pollard is only focused on the contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet.

As DeConto & Pollard say in their study: “…the rates of ice loss simulated here should not be viewed as actual predictions, but rather as possible envelopes of behaviour”. Determining the “likely” amount of sea level rise in the future is a prediction that is strongly dependent on the assumptions about how ice sheet behave and on what time scales. Based on just DeConto & Pollard’s studies, and the assumptions inherent in their model, one can conclude that it is likely that sea level will rise by more than 11 feet, just from Antarctic melting, over the next several centuries, if humans do not significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (see Figure 5 and S7 of DeConto & Pollard 2016). What the glaciological community as a whole considers “likely” depends on which processes we think are likely to be important contributors of ice sheet collapse, which is a matter that is actively under debate. Since the DeConto & Pollard study is relatively new, there is still an ongoing discussion about how likely it is that the Marine Ice Cliff Instability will actually occur and at what rate will it causes ice to be lost from individual glaciers. Though the article as a whole covers some parts of this debate, these individual statements about likelihood do not necessarily reflect a community consensus.

DeConto and Pollard (2016) Contribution of Antarctica to past and future sea-level rise, Nature",,,“it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios”,"Given DeConto and Pollard’s results, yes, though their model is one out of several models being actively developed to predict future sea-level rise.","Including the contribution from thermal expansion of seawater, mountain glaciers, and Greenland, three feet is probably a good estimate for the lower bound on the total sea level rise that can be expected from current and past climate change (many studies ask this question, but Pfeffer, 2008* is an oft-cited example). The key phrase here is total sea level rise, which may unfold in the next century or over the next several millennia as ice sheets continue to respond to past climate change for many hundreds to thousands of years. If this phrase refers to three feet of sea level rise from Antarctica by 2100, then it does not accurately represent the findings of DeConto & Pollard (see RCP 2.6 in Figure 5 of that study, above).

The topography beneath Jakobshavn extends to great depths (more than 1 km) for several tens of kilometres upstream of the current calving front (see this recent study by An et al, 2017*). This type of geometry may allow for rapid retreat without any extra push from a warming climate. Thwaites and Pine Island are completely different beasts—the sheer scale and the sea-level equivalent they contain is what’s troublesome with these two.

An et al (2017) Bed elevation of Jakobshavn Isbræ, West Greenland, from high-resolution airborne gravity and other data, Geophysical Research Letters","Yes, there are reasons to think Thwaites and Pine Island could collapse quickly, the most basic among them being that these glaciers are wider and potentially more slippery at the bed than Jakobshavn.",,,"“But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too.”","Regarding ice shelf stability, it is important to acknowledge (which the author didn’t do here) there are different processes at work on the Antarctic Peninsula, where the Larsen ice shelves reside(d), than on the Amundsen coast (Pine Island and Thwaites ice shelves). The Larsen A and B ice shelves were very thin, and have disintegrated from percolating surface meltwater (hydrofracturing) creating vertical cracks in the ice shelf. Larsen C is thicker and larger, but is also characterised by a relatively warm climate (many melt episodes in summer) and low snowfall (which makes it vulnerable to atmospheric warming). The ice shelves that buttress the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are much thicker, annual snowfall rates are very large, and surface melt rates are substantially lower than on the (former) Larsen ice shelves (3-5 times lower). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that surface-based ice shelf instability will occur within the next few decades—instead, these ice shelves would likely thin through contact with warmer ocean waters.",,,,"“‘If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,’ says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge. This signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century.”","Multiple studies have indicated that the marine ice sheet instability is likely already underway in the Pine Island region1,2.

There has been no evidence to suggest that the loss of ice from this region will stop. However, that the loss of ice from marine ice sheet instability is underway does NOT mean that the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet will destabilize this century. There is no evidence for the ice loss to occur that quickly.

What we do now will affect the outcome decades and centuries into the future. We do not know what the tipping points are in these systems, or whether we’ve crossed that line already. It is critical to establish whether retreat may become self-sustainable—that is, once we push the ball off the edge, it may keep rolling downhill even if we reverse current emission trends. That possibility is to me enough to dedicate significant funds and personnel on this problem.","This is strongly supported by the DeConto and Pollard 2016 Nature paper*, which showed that the Antarctic contribution to committed sea level rise can be limited to ~20 cm in a strong climate mitigation scenario (RCP2.6).

Until now, global efforts such as the Paris climate agreement have tried to limit global warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels. However, with latest projections pointing to an increase of 3.2C by 2100, these goals seem to be slipping out of reach.

Global temperature change
compared to pre-industrial levels

“[We] still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future,” said Erik Solheim, the UN environment chief, ahead of the upcoming Bonn conference.

One of the biggest resulting threats to cities around the world is sea-level rise, caused by the expansion of water at higher temperatures and melting ice sheets on the north and south poles.

Scientists at the non-profit organisation Climate Central estimate that 275 million people worldwide live in areas that will eventually be flooded at 3C of global warming.

Asian cities will be worst affected
The regional impact of these changes is highly uneven, with four out of five people affected living in Asia.


Although sea levels will not rise instantaneously, the calculated increases will be “locked in” at a temperature rise of 3C, meaning they will be irreversible even if warming eventually slows down.

Osaka, Japan
5.2 million people affected

At the end of a month in which it has been battered by unseasonably late typhoons and relentless rain, Japan is already confronting the threat posed by climate change-induced flooding.

Image modelling shows that swaths of Osaka – the commercial heart of a region whose GDP is almost as big as that of the Netherlands – would disappear beneath the water in a 3C world, threatening the local economy and almost a third of the wider region’s 19 million residents.

Millions of people live in the urban area surrounding Osaka. Sea-level rise will reshape densely and sparsely populated areas.

As a result of global sea-level rise, storm surges and other factors, economists project that coastal flooding could put almost $1tn of Osaka’s assets at risk by the 2070s, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The costs of protecting cities from rising sea levels and storms are also likely to rise - as are the costs of repairing storm damage,” it said. “Decisions we make today could have a profound impact on the security and culture of the people of this ancient city.”

Like much of Japan, Osaka already has a network of seawalls and other coastal defences in place to combat tsunami – although their effectiveness was disputed in the aftermath of the 2011 triple disaster.

Osaka city authorities are investing in other infrastructure to mitigate the effects of flooding, but public education is also vital, according to Toshikazu Nakaaki of the Osaka municipal government’s environment bureau.

“In the past our response was focused on reducing the causes of global warming, but given that climate change is inevitable, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we are now discussing how to respond to the natural disasters that will follow,” Nakaaki said.

“We anticipate that Osaka will be affected by natural disasters caused by climate change, but we have yet to establish exactly what might happen or how much financial damage they would cause.

“It’s not that we expect sea levels to rise at some point in the future – they are already rising.”

Keiko Kanai has long been aware that her home city is susceptible to natural disasters. “I’d heard that historically, tsunamis caused by earthquakes put many parts of Osaka underwater, and I knew that some parts of the world were at risk from rising sea levels,” said Kanai, who teaches at a local university.

“But I didn’t put two and two together. Until now I haven’t given much thought to the idea that Osaka too could be engulfed by rising sea levels.”

Kaori Akazawa, a nursing care consultant, said flooding was a consideration when she was deciding where in Osaka to live.

“When I moved here I talked to my colleagues about the risks,” she said. “That’s why I’ve always rented apartments on the fourth storey or higher.

“It’s worrying, but I’ve never considered moving.”

Alexandria, Egypt
3 million people affected

On the Alexandria Corniche, waves slowly lap at a shoreline dotted with plastic chairs and umbrellas from the beachside cafes. Students perch on the steps of the imposing Alexandria library. But the same coastline that draws locals to its scenic vistas is threatening to slowly engulf the historic city as sea levels rise due to global warming.


The IPCC reported that Alexandria’s beaches would be submerged even with a 0.5-metre sea-level rise, while 8 million people would be displaced by flooding in Alexandria and the Nile Delta if no protective measures are taken. A 3C world threatens far greater damage than that.

Yet for many residents, there is little public information to connect the increasingly chaotic weather and floods with climate change. “The vast majority of Alexandrians don’t have access to knowledge, and that’s what worries me. I don’t expect the government to raise awareness of this problem until it’s already happening,” said 22-year-old student Kareem Mohammed.

“Everyone thinks we should act on this problem 50 or 80 years from now,” agreed his friend, Hazem Hassan, a student in marine biology at the nearby Alexandria University.

Officials maintain that protective measures are being taken, but with little fanfare. “Egypt spends 700m EGP [£30m] annually to protect the north coast,” said Dr Magdy Allam, head of the Arab Environmental Experts Union, who was previously part of the Egyptian environment ministry.

Allam cited the Mohammed Ali sea wall built in 1830 as a key protection, as well as the concrete blocks lining the shoreline designed to “detour flood water away from residential neighbourhoods”. But critics say that this is far from enough given the scale of the problem.

“There are studies indicating that our city is one of many coastal human settlements around the world which will be partially submerged by 2070 if nothing is done,” said Ahmed Hassan, of the Save Alexandria Initiative, a group that works to raise awareness of the effects of climate change on the city.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
1.8 million people affected

Residents of Brazil’s postcard city have plenty of reasons to fear global warming – even if they don’t quite know it. According to Climate Central, a temperature rise of 3C would cause flooding of not just Rio’s famous beaches such as Copacabana and its waterfront domestic airport, but also inland areas of the Barra de Tijuca neighbourhood, where last year’s Olympic Games were held.


Barra is built around a network of heavily polluted lagoons that empty into the sea. The prospect of it being underwater alarmed resident Sueli Gonçalves, 46, who runs pensioners’ health projects, as she and her 23-year-old son Yuri Sanchez carried their shopping past the Olympic Park.

“My God. Oh Jesus,” she said, with a nervous laugh. “I will leave here. I will go to the United States. To Canada.”

The family knew about global warming but were unaware of the potential scale of the impact on their upscale neighbourhood of smart condominiums and a shopping mall.

“Nobody takes it seriously. People do not think long term,” Gonçalves said.

Storm surges recently destroyed hundreds of metres of beachfront pavement overlooking the Macumba beach, a popular surfing spot on Rio’s western fringes. Last year, heavy waves in another storm surge felled an elevated, clifftop cycle path between Leblon beach and Barra de Tijuca which had not been built to survive such high seas, killing two people.

Last year, Rio’s city government and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro produced a study entitled Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change.

“The current challenge consists in deepening knowledge and monitoring of oceanic phenomena and the evolution of the sea bed and coast,” a spokeswoman for the city’s secretariat of the environment said in an email. An “adaption plan” for climate change produced with professors from the federal university suggested strategies to deal with vulnerabilities in areas such as transport, health and housing. But so far little has been done.

Nara Pinto, 38, who lives in the sprawling Rocinha favela and sells snacks on the pavement overlooking Copacabana beach, said the loss of Rio’s famous beaches would cost a lot of jobs.

“The beach is a tourist point,” she said. “What can be done to stop this?

Shanghai, China
17.5 million people affected

“Shanghai is completely gone – I’d have to move to Tibet!” says resident Wang Liubin, when he is shown projections for the city after 3C of global warming.

When it comes to flooding, the coastal city is one of the world’s most vulnerable. Now one of the world’s biggest ports, the former fishing village is bordered by the Yangtze river in the north and divided through the middle by the Huangpu river; the municipality involves several islands, two long coastlines, shipping ports, and miles of canals, rivers, and waterways.


In 2012, a report from a team of UK and Dutch scientists declared Shanghai the most vulnerable major city in the world to serious flooding, based on factors such as numbers of people living close to the coastline, time needed to recover from flooding, and measures to prevent floodwater. According to Climate Central projections, 17.5 million people could be displaced by rising waters if global temperatures increase by 3C.

Projections show the vast majority of the city could eventually be submerged in water, including much of the downtown area, landmarks such as the Lujiazui skyline and the historical Bund, both airports, and the entirety of its outlying Chongming Island.

Since 2012, the government has been making steady inroads to tackle the threat, including building China’s largest deepwater drainage system beneath the Suzhou Creek waterway, made up of 15km of pipes to drain rainwater across a 58 sq km area. It has also rolled out a 40bn yuan (£5bn) River Flood Discharge project which will stretch for 120km between Lake Taihu and the Huangpu river to try and mitigate the risk of the upstream lake flooding.

Flood prevention walls are being built along the waterfront – in places so high the river is blocked from view – and 200km more are promised across the city’s outlying districts. Flood controls have been put in place along the famous Bund waterfront, where the walkway has been raised to help counter a flood risk, as well as a series of water controls and dams.

Miami, US
2.7 million people affected

Few other cities in the world have as much to lose from rising sea levels as Miami, and the alarm bells sound ever louder with each successive “king tide” that overwhelms coastal defences and sends knee-deep seawater coursing through downtown streets.


Locals consider this the “new normal” in the biggest city of Florida’s largest metropolitan area, which would simply cease to exist with a 3C temperature rise. Even at 2C, forecasts show almost the entire bottom third of Florida – the area south of Lake Okeechobee currently home to more than 7 million people - submerged, with grim projections for the rest of the state in a little more than half a century. In Miami-Dade county alone, almost $15bn of coastal property is at risk of flooding in just the next 15 years.

A sense of urgency is evident at city hall, where commissioners are asking voters to approve a “Miami Forever” bond in the November ballot that includes $192m for upgrading pump stations, improving drainage and raising sea walls.

“We have a really precious city that many people love and are willing to invest in right now, but it’s going to take some funds to protect it,” said Ken Russell, the city commission’s vice-chair.

Last year, the city of Miami appointed sea-rise expert Jane Gilbert into the newly created role of chief resilience officer with instructions for a robust stormwater management plan that also looks at storm surge, such as that from Hurricane Irma in September which brought significant flooding to downtown Brickell and neighbouring Coconut Grove.

Proposals include elevating roads and even abandoning neighbourhoods to the water to protect others.

“We need universal recognition that we’re all in this together, to protect this amazing global city that we’ve become,” she said.

Natalia Ortiz, who grew up in Miami, fears the future. “It’s very scary,” said Ortiz, who works with Cleo, a climate change advocacy group. “My son is 11 and my daughter is nine, so they’re young but I think about their future, will they be able to raise their children in Miami the way I had the luxury of raising mine?”

Methodology

Flood maps were created using sea-level rise estimates from Climate Central and digital elevation data. Population estimates refer to urban agglomerations, which comprise the built-up area of a city and the suburbs linked with it. Maps include OpenStreetMap data.

Temperature projections are based on University of Washington emissions modelling and UN warming estimates. Trajectories have been updated to match latest temperatures as recorded by the Met Office Hadley Centre.",contrasted,"Insightful, Misleading",49,"This story in The Guardian includes maps of, and reporting from, five coastal cities that will be affected by continued sea level rise. The story discusses the impact sea level rise will have on those cities, and what they are doing to prepare and adapt.

However, scientists who reviewed the story found that it fails to explain one very important thing to readers: nowhere is it explained that the magnitude of sea level rise shown (for a scenario in which the world warms by 3 °C) is the amount that would occur after the planet has had centuries to millennia to come into equilibrium with elevated temperatures. Readers are likely to assume that the story’s maps illustrate sea level rise that could occur before the end of the 21st century, but this is not the case.

",,,,,"Chris Roberts, Research Scientist, ECMWF/Met Office:","The methodology is appropriate, but the time scales involved should have been made clearer.

From the original report, “locked in” sea level is defined as “the sustained temperature increase or SLR that will ensue on a time scale of centuries to millennia”. This is not the same as the sea level rise that has already occurred if temperatures reach 3 °C, which is not obvious from the figures or text.

","Andrew Shepherd, Professor, University of Leeds","The Guardian article makes no mention of the timescale over which the “locked-in” sea level rise associated with a 3 °C climate warming would take place. The Climate Central report states that “the sea levels described could possibly, but with low probability, occur sooner than 200 years from now, or be reached as far as 2,000 years in the future”. Most readers would interpret this to mean there is a high probability that the timescale for the associated sea level rise would therefore fall between 200 and 2,000 years. This would have been a useful piece of information for the Guardian article to make clear. I think the Guardian article can be judged as misleading, because the only timescales mentioned are those of the warming and not the consequent sea level rise, and these are not matched.

","Jeremy Fyke, Postdoctoral researcher, Los Alamos National Laboratory:","This article provides an excellent visual of an unfortunately very likely general future for humanity, in which sea level rise slowly inundates many coastal cities with accelerating impacts on a vast global population. It is very well presented visually, and does a great job of attempting to link global change (sea level rise) to impacts on individuals and communities—which is practically the whole point of worrying about climate change in the first place.

However, one major drawback of this article is that the magnitude and timescale of the sea level rises described in this report are not well explained. This probably leaves readers confused about, for example, what exact level of sea level rise is actually shown in the interactive plots, and over what timescale this could occur. This weakness in turn relates back to the methodology of the single study that underpins this work: Levermann et al, 2013*. In this work, they estimate the final sea level rise that occurs after several thousand years of climate response to greenhouse gas emissions. Unless I’m mistaken, it seems that this magnitude of sea level rise is what is being shown in these figures. (Though this is impossible to verify since no actual sea level rise numbers are printed, I think!) What is shown is not the sea level rise that will occur at year 2100 (as is sort of implied by the presence of figure 1). Thus it is a bit disingenuous to elicit reader reactions to sea level rise plots which represent scenarios that will practically not occur for thousands of years.

If we’re talking practical responses to sea level rise in present-day cities, we also need to talk about practically relevant sea level changes (not changes 2,000 years in the future, although these are of profound significance as well). Unfortunately, this article somewhat conflates millennial-scale sea level change with near-term (i.e., decadal to 2100-scale) responses.

Regardless, I continue to encourage this type of work by the Guardian to portray complex and critically societally relevant scientific data in a way that is immediately interpretable by the public.

The Independent makes a giant leap in stating that modern global warming could be “worse than thought” based on a single study,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/independent-makes-giant-leap-global-warming-worse-than-thought-single-study-andrew-griffin/,Climate change might be worse than thought after scientists find major mistake in water temperature readings,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/climate-change-worse-water-temperature-reading-scientists-global-warming-ice-melt-weather-a8020696.html,"Global warming might be far worse than we thought, according to a new study.

The research challenges the ways that researchers have worked out sea temperatures until now, meaning that they may be increasing quicker than previously suggested.

The methodology widely used to understand sea temperatures in the scientific community may be based on a mistake, the new study suggests, and so our understanding of climate change might be fundamentally flawed.

The new research suggests that the oceans hundreds of millions of years ago were much cooler than we thought. If true, that means that the global warming we are currently undergoing is unparallelled within the last 100 million years, and far worse than we had previously calculated.

Until now, scientists believed that the temperature of the ocean depths and the surface of the polar ocean 100 million years ago were about 15 degrees warmer than they are today. But they might in fact have stayed relatively stable – making the warming we're currently undergoing far more alarming.

""If we are right, our study challenges decades of paleoclimate research,"" said Anders Meibom, the head of EPFL's Laboratory for Biological Geochemistry and a professor at the University of Lausanne.

""Oceans cover 70% of our planet. They play a key role in the earth's climate. Knowing the extent to which their temperatures have varied over geological time is crucial if we are to gain a fuller understanding of how they behave and to predict the consequences of current climate change more accurately.""

The researchers believe that scientists have been overlooking crucial processes when they calculated the temperature of the seas millions of years ago. In so doing, they may have been mistakenly thinking that they were warmer than they actually are.

Until now, scientists have calculated the temperature of the ancient seas by looking at foraminifera, the fossils of tiny marine organisms found in the sediment on the ocean floor. Those form small shells and take on more or less of an oxygen isotope depending on how warm the water is, so by looking at the oxygen content they can estimate the temperature when those fossils were around.

That working led scientists to believe that the temperature of the seas had fallen by 15 degrees over the last 100 million years.

But the new research shows that the amount of oxygen in those shells doesn't actually remain constant over time. The new research showed that they can change – and without leaving any visible trace that would alert scientists to that change.

""What appeared to be perfectly preserved fossils are in fact not. This means that the paleotemperature estimates made up to now are incorrect,"" said Sylvain Bernard, a CNRS researcher at the Paris-based Institute of Mineralogy, Materials Physics and Cosmochemistry and the study's lead author.

The scientists behind the study claim that the apparent cooling of the oceans was actually just the effect of the process they've seen. The changes in the amount of oxygen in the shells isn't a reflection of changing temperatures – just a consequence of the fact that the amount of oxygen seen changes over time anyway.

The French and Swiss researchers behind the paper have already got to work trying to understand what the temperatures actually are. ""To revisit the ocean's paleotemperatures now, we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration, which has been overlooked for too long. For that, we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time,"" said Professor Meibom.

The research was conducted by French researchers from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Sorbonne University and the University of Strasbourg, and Swiss researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and the University of Lausanne. It has just been published in Nature Communications.",low,"Flawed reasoning, Inappropriate sources, Misleading",111,"This article in The Independent describes a study examining one type of “proxy” record for past global temperatures the geologic record.

Scientists who reviewed the article explained that this conclusion is not logically connected to the contents of the study. The article exaggerates the study’s implications for records of past climate—there are multiple types of proxy records that have been used to study those time periods— and invents implications for future warming.",,,,,"Marcus Badger, Lecturer in Earth Sciences, The Open University","The article reports on a paper which suggests there may be complications with ONE method we use to determine past ocean temperature. Notwithstanding possible flaws in the methods of the paper, the article ignores significant evidence from other measurements and observations and tells us nothing directly about the severity of future and present climate change.

The tone of the article is overly alarmist and unfounded based on the study in question.","Mitch Lyle, Professor, Sr. Research, Oregon State University","The article has minor inaccuracies reporting a flawed study. The original study has defects. If all the past records of climate warming via oxygen isotopes were wrong, they would need to be buried to the same depth (or at least to the same temperature) to get the common overprint. Depth of burial varies by a huge amount. The study also fails to acknowledge that oxygen isotopes are only one way used to measure ocean temperature.

It may challenge the way we work out sea temperatures (although as I will note later the paper seriously overstates its case), but this doesn’t change the observed rates of change in the post-industrial era. This is inaccurately presented.

And in any case, there is evidence of warmer poles from other proxies besides oxygen isotopes—organic biomolecule-based proxies (like TEX86), for example. Quite aside from that, there were lush forests where today there is only ice. The fact that the poles were warmer is not something to be called into question by this one study on one proxy, on one type of foraminifera subjected to very high temperatures in the lab. I don’t suggest that this can’t be operating on oxygen isotopes at some level, but given the wealth of other evidence, I suggest the authors of this study, and subsequently the author of this piece, have gone well overboard with their assessment.",,,,"“‘If we are right, our study challenges decades of paleoclimate research,” said Anders Meibom, the head of EPFL’s Laboratory for Biological Geochemistry and a professor at the University of Lausanne.”","It seems the authors of this paper are not au fait with the decades of work that has been done with other proxies that also show warmth at these times, since they take their observed changes in oxygen isotopes in deeply buried and heated sediments, and extend their results outrageously, discounting hundreds of papers on either shallow, well-preserved samples, or organic temperature proxies, or pollen assemblages, or leaf margin analysis, or clumped isotopes—all of which show that the poles were indeed warmer at this time.

","It only potentially challenges ONE method used to reconstruct past temperatures. Other methods and observations based on biomarkers, pollen, large fossils support a much warmer ocean at this time.",,,"“Until now, scientists have calculated the temperature of the ancient seas by looking at foraminifera, the fossils of tiny marine organisms found in the sediment on the ocean floor.”","This is only one way that scientists have calculated the temperature of the ocean, and they will continue to do so.",,,,"“But the new research shows that the amount of oxygen in those shells doesn’t actually remain constant over time.”
","It’s nothing to do with the amount of Oxygen. It’s CaCO3, so oxygen content is pretty much fixed—it’s the isotopic ratio of the oxygen that is incorporated.

"Commentary in The Australian ignores evidence and misrepresents research while falsely claiming humans are not responsible for climate change
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/commentary-australian-ignores-evidence-misrepresents-research-falsely-claiming-humans-not-responsible-climate-change-ian-plimer/,Misguided renewable energy policies will ruin nation,http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/misguided-renewable-energy-policies-will-ruin-the-nation/news-story/1f0ad93fa98a37fbf6ddd6c8eb425231,"You couldn’t make it up if you tried. Australia is a huge exporter of energy as coal, LNG and uranium, yet it has unreliable and ­expensive electricity. South Australia has achieved a first for ­Australia: it has the most expensive electricity in the world. A short time ago it had cheap coal-fired power.

Australia remains the only G20 country with no nuclear power yet has 30 per cent of the planet’s in-ground uranium, mainly in South Australia. Vic­toria has banned drilling for ­onshore gas in its two gas-rich ­basins yet suffers a gas shortage.

Australia’s energy crisis is based on a flawed fundamental. Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions. It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming. If it were shown, it would also have to be shown that the 97 per cent of emissions from natural processes such as ocean degassing, volcanoes, natural chemical reactions and exhalation don’t drive global warming.

In the geological past, Earth’s atmosphere had hundreds of times the CO2 content of the modern atmosphere yet there were no carbon dioxide-driven catastrophes. The past shows that climate change is normal, that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill.

Ice core drilling shows that 800 years after natural warming, the atmosphere increases in carbon dioxide. The zenith of the Little Ice Age was 300 years ago and since then we have slightly warmed and cooled during a long-term warming trend. Instrumental temperature measurements over the past 150 years show no correlation between human emissions of CO2 and ­temperature. On all timescales it can be shown that there is no correlation between CO2 emissions and global warming. Without correlation, there can be no causation.

The worldwide temperature record has been changed. Cooling trends have been “homogenised” to warming trends. In the corporate world, if a loss is “homo­genised” to a profit, it is fraud. Why is climate science different?

No genuine environmentalist could honestly support subsidised wind turbines that despoil the scenery, slice and dice birds and bats, damage human health and spread toxins. This is not environmentalism. It is power over people by unelected activists, often ­funded from outside Australia.

Unless the laws of physics are changed, solar power cannot be made more efficient. Solar facilities result in the clearing and environmental degradation of huge acreages and depositing of toxins.

Construction and maintenance of wind and solar facilities ­release far more carbon dioxide than they are meant to save over their working lives and they need to be sup­ported 24/7 by coal-fired generators. The Spaniards invented a way of producing solar power at night without changing the laws of physics. Diesel generators with floodlights illuminated solar ­panels. Subsidies were so generous that profits could still be made at night. No wonder Spain went broke.

Australia’s CO2 emissions are only 1.3 per cent of global human emissions, which are 3 per cent of the total global emissions. To reduce Australian emissions will have absolutely no effect on the planet’s temperature. The only effect will be a rapid reduction in jobs as electricity prices skyrocket.

Those who signed the Paris ­Accord actually believed they can twiddle the planetary dials to minimise warming to less than 2 Celsius yet seemed blissfully ­unaware that whatever humans do, they cannot change Earth’s orbit and radiation released from the sun that drive climate. Australia’s signed a suicide note yet didn’t seem to notice that China, India, Indonesia and the US did not commit to reducing their large carbon dioxide emissions.

The grasslands, crops, forests and territorial waters of Australia absorb more carbon dioxide than Australia emits. Australia should demand the Paris Accord shell out some of the billions sloshing around in the climate business.

The subsidies for wind and solar power and the must-take mandate have attracted all sorts of dodgy enterprises, lickspittles and carpetbaggers to the renewable energy honey pot. The National Energy Market was the nail in the coffin and, after 40 years of falling electricity costs and a reliable grid, Australia now has energy poverty and destruction of businesses. Electricity is not a luxury; it is a necessity for any civilised society.

The solution requires political courage. Cancel the renewable energy target, large-scale RET, ­renewable energy certificates, clean energy target and any funding that subsidises renewable ­energy. Cancel funding for climate research institutes, climate conferences, carbon capture schemes and jaunts for signing suicide notes.

If any energy company provides electricity to the grid, decree that it must have 90 per cent availability 24/7 and get rid of the must-take mandate. Cancel the charitable status of feral activist groups like Greenpeace. Change the Corporations Law such that green activists, environmentalists, unionists and lobbyists abide by the same conditions of probity as company directors.

Because investment confidence in energy in Australia has been destroyed, governments must build modern coal-fired and nuclear power stations. Australia needs a nuclear industry that could start by using modular reactors for isolated mines and towns before growing a vertically integrated nuclear industry.

Only elections can change the madness but no major political party has nation-building leaders and a coherent policy to cut electricity costs and ­increase reliability. Politicians fiddle around the edges. As soon as the words emissions, climate change and Paris are used, you know you are being conned and that the world’s biggest scam will continue.

Australia’s energy policy is based on the fallacious assumption that human emissions of CO2 drive global warming. This underpins the Finkel and Australian Competition and Consumer Com­­mis­sion reports, the Paris ­Accord and political quick-fix ­solutions. Renewable energy has become ruinable energy, thanks to green ideology.

I fear there will be years of ­increasing pain before there is enough political courage to bring Australia to what it had in the past: cheap, reliable employment-generating electricity.

",very_low,"Biased, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",207,"This opinion in The Australian by Ian Plimer repeats a number of false but common claims to support an argument that human activities are not responsible for climate change, and that renewables like wind and solar cannot effectively replace fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions.”
","Global human emissions are indeed only a small percentage of what ecosystems cycle, but the reasoning is completely flawed. Regarding the impact on climate, it is the net emissions that matter, not the amount of carbon that is being cycled over and over. Terrestrial ecosystems take up and re-emit about 12 times more CO2 than humans emit, and oceans cycle about 9 times more CO2 than we emit. BUT! This carbon uptake and release is more or less balanced at the annual scale, and net ecosystem emissions are even negative. Without these ecosystems, atmospheric CO2 concentration would have risen even more as a consequence of fossil fuel burning; the CO2 concentration in the air would already be around 550 ppm (instead of the current ~400 ppm). Hence, it is absolutely misleading to compare amounts of CO2 cycling through the ecosystems with human CO2 emissions in this context. If anything, the CO2 cycling through the ecosystems should be taken as a reason to safeguard them: if we lose these carbon sinks, CO2 in the air will increase no matter what we do.
","This is purposely misleading. Others have commented appropriately. The global carbon budget provides an overview of sources and sinks of CO2 since 1880.

","Others have already commented on this in detail. Just to emphasize: the statement is clearly misleading. What matters here is how human emissions drive the net atmospheric CO2 budget (emissions minus uptake) out of balance, which leads to an accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.",,"“It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.”
","This sentence essentially ignores many thousands of studies that provide evidence to the contrary (i.e., that human CO2 emissions ARE driving global warming) and is therefore factually wrong.

IPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis","Virtually all statements in this article have been proven wrong so many times by scientific experts that it is unreasonable to once again show that they are wrong. But I want to focus on the statement “it has never been shown” only. How can one claim that the impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions has “never been shown that…”? Clearly, for this author, science per se either does not exist or else has no credibility whatsoever. Surely then, scientific research itself cannot exist, there is no geology to find coal resources, no studies “of natural processes such as ocean degassing”, etc. From this, one can only conclude that we actually cannot know anything—not even the things that this author believes to be true.
","This is not true. In fact, there is a vast body of work on detection and attribution, which specializes in exactly this: determining the causes of observed changes in climate. This happens in a two-step process. Step 1 (the detection step) looks at whether observed changes can be explained by internal climate variability. If the answer is no, step 2 (the attribution step) determines which factors explain the observed changes.",,"“natural processes such as ocean degassing, volcanoes, natural chemical reactions and exhalation don’t drive global warming.”",Here is a great illustration of how these processes don’t drive warming over the observational period: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/,,,,"“In the geological past, Earth’s atmosphere had hundreds of times the CO2 content of the modern atmosphere yet there were no carbon dioxide-driven catastrophes. The past shows that climate change is normal, that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill.”","There are many problems with this statement, starting with an entire lack of accuracy. It reads like a series of generic statements that can easily be taken out of context and are entirely irrelevant to the problem at hand. One particularly striking point is the implicitly obvious lack of awareness for timescales. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are changing at unprecedented rates now, posing a serious threat to biodiversity in rapidly changing ecosystems.

","Indeed, climate change is normal, but there are 2 important differences with respect to the geological record: 1) the current rate of increase in CO2 is unprecedented and 2) the current CO2 increase is caused by human emissions.",,,"“Ice core drilling shows that 800 years after natural warming, the atmosphere increases in carbon dioxide”","Recent work* shows that the temperature and CO2 rise were synchronous within uncertainties: if there was a lag it was less than 400 years, not 800 years as previously thought. Additionally, the temperature increase over the deglaciation cannot be explained solely by orbitally driven insolation changes (modifications of solar energy received by the Earth due to its position). The radiative effect of the CO2 rise amplifies the warming and explains part of the total deglacial warming.

Parrenin et al (2013) Synchronous Change of Atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic Temperature During the Last Deglacial Warming, Science",,,,“Instrumental temperature measurements over the past 150 years show no correlation between human emissions of CO2 and ­temperature.”,"Plotting the relationship between global temperature and the logarithm of atmospheric CO2 concentration shows a strong relationship (figure below). This is predicted by physics* since CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Ian Plimer might be confusing CO2 emissions and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which is what matters for explaining Earth’s surface temperature.

","Instrumental temperature measurements over the last 150 years record weather/climate that is influenced by more than ONLY CO2. Natural variation must also be considered, including semi- to multi-decadal processes involving the ocean and atmosphere (e.g. El Niño-Southern Oscillation).",,,“On all timescales it can be shown that there is no correlation between CO2 emissions and global warming.”,"This is simply false. Ice cores show correlation over ice age cycles (100,000 years).


The modern observational record shows correlation that cannot be reproduced without including greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O). Climate models demonstrate this correlation very well. If you include only natural climate forcing (volcanoes, solar variations, etc.) over the observational period, models UNDERpredict observed temperatures. If you include only greenhouse gas forcing over the observational period, models OVERpredict observed temperatures. If you include natural, greenhouse gas, and other anthropogenic forcings (including cooling effects of coal/soot pollution particulates), models quite accurately match observations.

","This point has been refuted ad nauseam. See Zeke Hausfather’s explaination here: https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-data-adjustments-affect-global-temperature-records

Berkeley Earth independently assessed these records. The adjustments, which are necessary over 150-200 years of measurements of varying type and quality, end up reducing the warming trend over the 20th Century.

","Every time new data is assimilated, the record is bound to change slightly. I think the author is referring to a discontinuity in the global temperature record around 1945 that was shown to be due to changes in the instruments after WWII*. Since this discontinuity was reported, new temperature products were corrected for instrumentation change. This is not fraud, just good science.

Thompson et al (2008) A large discontinuity in the mid-twentieth century in observed global-mean surface temperature, Nature",,,“[South Australia] has the most expensive electricity in the world.”,"This is misleading. It is true that prices have rapidly increased, largely due to high natural gas prices from the start-up of gas liquefaction plants. However, there are plenty of other regions within countries (note South Australia is a region within the country of Australia) with just as high or higher electricity prices. How about villages in Alaska? Small islands? This claim is just misleading.",,,,"“Unless the laws of physics are changed, solar power cannot be made more efficient.”
","This is incorrect. Sure, if you use exactly the same technologies we have today there is a barrier to the efficiency of polycrystalline solar panels. But there are many other technologies in the works that can have much higher efficiency.

","This is completely incorrect. There are numerous studies contradicting this. For example, see a series of studies by Sally Benson at Stanford University. Frankly, both parts of this claim are absurd. Coal-fired generators are particularly poorly-suited to act as a backup for solar because they generally are very expensive to ramp up and down, so they are used almost everywhere around the world as baseload generators. Natural gas or hydro are much better suited as backup. This sentence belies a lack of understanding of energy technologies and markets.",,,,“[Those who signed the Paris Accord] cannot change Earth’s orbit and radiation released from the sun that drive climate”,"The problem we are dealing with here is not the radiation released from the sun, but with the amount of energy that remains in the Earth’s climate system. The amount of energy trapped in the climate system increases due to the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere: rather than shooting the energy back into space, it is used to heat the climate system. Simple physical laws, that make that more greenhouse gases cause a warmer climate.

NASA’s Earth Observatory has an extensive explanation.","This links back to the author’s earlier claim about ice cores, that they show increasing CO2 after “natural warming.” In this ancient scenario, he is correct that warming was caused by changes in Earth’s orbit around the Sun—which slightly but significantly affects the planetary energy budget. However, it is no longer the case that solely Earth’s orbit and solar radiation drive climate change. Solar energy reaching Earth has been declining for decades, as global average temperatures have continued to increase. Zeke Hausfather has nicely explained this.",,,"“Australia’s signed a suicide note [with the Paris Accord] yet didn’t seem to notice that China, India, Indonesia and the US did not commit to reducing their large carbon dioxide emissions.”","China and India are actually changing track.

The country’s solar capacity, too, is increasing steadily and China has already overtaken Germany to become the country with the largest cumulative solar PV capacity globally. Regarding future investment in further renewables capacity, China claims the top spot in the 2015 Climatescope project, which ranks 55 emerging economies according to their ability to attract investment in clean energy, and places second globally after the US in Ernst and Young’s 2016 Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index.”",,,,"“The grasslands, crops, forests and territorial waters of Australia absorb more carbon dioxide than Australia emits.”","This is not true.

BBC article on ocean acidification report accurate but brief,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/bbc-article-ocean-acidification-accurate-brief-roger-harrabin/,More acidic oceans 'will affect all sea life',http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-41653511,"All sea life will be affected because carbon dioxide emissions from modern society are making the oceans more acidic, a major new report will say.

The eight-year study from more than 250 scientists finds that infant sea creatures will be especially harmed.

This means the number of baby cod growing to adulthood could fall to a quarter or even a 12th of today's numbers, the researchers suggest.

The assessment comes from the BIOACID project, which is led from Germany.

A brochure summarising the main outcomes will be presented to climate negotiators at their annual meeting, which this year is taking place in Bonn in November.

The Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification report authors say some creatures may benefit directly from the chemical changes - but even these could still be adversely affected indirectly by shifts in the whole food web.

What is more, the research shows that changes through acidification will be made worse by climate change, pollution, coastal development, over-fishing and agricultural fertilisers.

Ocean acidification is happening because as CO2 from fossil fuels dissolves in seawater, it produces carbonic acid and this lowers the pH of the water.

Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the average pH of global ocean surface waters have fallen from pH 8.2 to 8.1. This represents an increase in acidity of about 26%.

The study's lead author is Prof Ulf Riebesell from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel.

He is a world authority on the topic and has typically communicated cautiously about the effects of acidification.

He told BBC News: ""Acidification affects marine life across all groups, although to different degrees.

""Warm-water corals are generally more sensitive than cold-water corals. Clams and snails are more sensitive than crustaceans.

""And we found that early life stages are generally more affected than adult organisms.

""But even if an organism isn't directly harmed by acidification it may be affected indirectly through changes in its habitat or changes in the food web.

""At the end of the day, these changes will affect the many services the ocean provides to us.""

On the agenda
Since 2009, scientists working under the BIOACID programme have studied how marine creatures are affected by acidification during different life stages; how these reactions reverberate through the marine food web; and whether the challenges can be mitigated by evolutionary adaptation.

Some research was done in the lab but other studies were conducted in the North Sea, the Baltic, the Arctic, and Papua New Guinea.

A synthesis of more than 350 publications on the effects of ocean acidification - which will be given to climate delegates at next month's summit - reveals that almost half of the marine animal species tested reacted negatively to already moderate increases in seawater CO2 concentrations.

Early life stages were affected in Atlantic cod, blue mussels, starfish, sea urchins and sea butterflies.

But an experiment with barnacles showed they were not sensitive to acidification. And some plants - like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis - may even benefit.

Dr Carol Turley, an ocean acidification expert from Plymouth Marine Labs in the UK described the BIOACID research as enormously important.

She told BBC News: ""It's contributed enormous insights into the impacts that acidification can have on a wide range of marine organisms from microbes to fish.

""It's also explored how in combination with ocean warming and other stressors it might play out at the ecosystem level and affect human society.

""On the lead-up to the UN climate change negotiations in Bonn this November it is clear that the ocean and its ecosystems should not be ignored.""

The conference is being held in Germany but it is being chaired by Fiji, which wants delegates to give due prominence to the effects of CO2 on the ocean.",high,Accurate,107,"This BBC article describes an as-yet-unreleased report on ocean acidification from a major collaborative scientific project called BIOACID.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that it was generally accurate in its description of the forthcoming report’s overall conclusions that ocean acidification poses an important threat to marine ecosystems. However, the BIOACID report will cover a broad and complex field of research, very little of which is explained in this short article.",,,,,"Lennart Bach, Postdoctoral research fellow, GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel",A good summary of BIOACID’s key results.

It is also important that the author mentions that there are potential winners (e.g. macroalgae) in an acidified ocean and that not every organism is negatively affected.,"Jean-Pierre Gattuso, Research Professor, CNRS, Université Pierre et Marie Curie and IDDRI","The German program BIOACID has generated an impressive amount of knowledge on ocean acidification and its impacts.

It is nevertheless true that the pH will most likely decrease (and has already done so in the past). A small change in the pH leads to large shifts in seawater carbonate chemistry (as the author correctly mentions later in the main text).

The pH change will affect many species. I am not sure if the statement “all sea life” is justified at this stage. Indirect effects will likely play a major role here (as mentioned later in the text) but this still lacks evidence. This is more like “work in progress” I would say.",,,,"“Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the average pH of global ocean surface waters have fallen from pH 8.2 to 8.1.

","This statement is based on on a study by Stiasny et al*. The authors write: “Here, we obtain first experimental mortality estimates for Atlantic cod larvae under OA and incorporate these effects into recruitment models. End-of-century levels of ocean acidification (~1100 μatm according to the IPCC RCP 8.5) resulted in a doubling of daily mortality rates compared to present-day CO2 concentrations during the first 25 days post hatching (dph), a critical phase for population recruitment. These results were consistent under different feeding regimes, stocking densities and in two cod populations (Western Baltic and Barents Sea stock). When mortality data were included into Ricker-type stock-recruitment models, recruitment was reduced to an average of 8 and 24% of current recruitment for the two populations, respectively. Our results highlight the importance of including vulnerable early life stages when addressing effects of climate change on fish stocks.”

"New York Times’ “straightforward answers” to common climate questions are accurate, too",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-straightforward-answers-common-climate-questions-accurate-justin-gillis/,Climate Change Is Complex. We’ve Got Answers to Your Questions.,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/climate/what-is-climate-change.html,"Part 1. What is happening?
1.
Climate change? Global warming? What do we call it?
Both are accurate, but they mean different things.

You can think of global warming as one type of climate change. The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.

President Trump has claimed that scientists stopped referring to global warming and started calling it climate change because “the weather has been so cold” in winter. But the claim is false. Scientists have used both terms for decades.

2.
How much is the Earth heating up?
Two degrees is more significant than it sounds.

As of early 2017, the Earth had warmed by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 1 degree Celsius) since 1880, when records began at a global scale. The number may sound low, but as an average over the surface of an entire planet, it is actually high, which explains why much of the world’s land ice is starting to melt and the oceans are rising at an accelerating pace. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, scientists say, the global warming could ultimately exceed 8 degrees Fahrenheit, which would undermine the planet’s capacity to support a large human population.

3.
What is the greenhouse effect, and
how does it cause global warming?
We’ve known about it for more than a century. Really.

In the 19th century, scientists discovered that certain gases in the air trap and slow down heat that would otherwise escape to space. Carbon dioxide is a major player; without any of it in the air, the Earth would be a frozen wasteland. The first prediction that the planet would warm as humans released more of the gas was made in 1896. The gas has increased 43 percent above the pre-industrial level so far, and the Earth has warmed by roughly the amount that scientists predicted it would.

4.
How do we know humans are responsible
for the increase in carbon dioxide?
This one is nailed down.

Hard evidence, including studies that use radioactivity to distinguish industrial emissions from natural emissions, shows that the extra gas is coming from human activity. Carbon dioxide levels rose and fell naturally in the long-ago past, but those changes took thousands of years. Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done.

5.
Could natural factors be the cause of the warming?
Nope.

In theory, they could be. If the sun were to start putting out more radiation, for instance, that would definitely warm the Earth. But scientists have looked carefully at the natural factors known to influence planetary temperature and found that they are not changing nearly enough. The warming is extremely rapid on the geologic time scale, and no other factor can explain it as well as human emissions of greenhouse gases.

6.
Why do people deny the science of climate change?
Mostly because of ideology.

Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented, some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science.

President Trump has sometimes claimed that scientists are engaged in a worldwide hoax to fool the public, or that global warming was invented by China to disable American industry. The climate denialists’ arguments have become so strained that even oil and coal companies have distanced themselves publicly, though some still help to finance the campaigns of politicians who espouse such views.

Part 2. What could happen?
1.
How much trouble are we in?
Big trouble.

Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to gradually warm, with more extreme weather. Coral reefs and other sensitive habitats are already starting to die. Longer term, if emissions rise unchecked, scientists fear climate effects so severe that they might destabilize governments, produce waves of refugees, precipitate the sixth mass extinction of plants and animals in the Earth’s history, and melt the polar ice caps, causing the seas to rise high enough to flood most of the world’s coastal cities. The emissions that create those risks are happening now, raising deep moral questions for our generation.

2.
How much should I worry about
climate change affecting me directly?
Are you rich enough to shield your descendants?

The simple reality is that people are already feeling the effects, whether they know it or not. Because of sea level rise, for instance, some 83,000 more residents of New York and New Jersey were flooded during Hurricane Sandy than would have been the case in a stable climate, scientists have calculated. Tens of thousands of people are already dying in heat waves made worse by global warming. The refugee flows that have destabilized politics around the world have been traced in part to climate change. Of course, as with almost all other social problems, poor people will be hit first and hardest.

3.
How much will the seas rise?
The real question is how fast.

The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century, forcing governments and property owners to spend tens of billions of dollars fighting coastal erosion. But if that rate continued, it would probably be manageable, experts say.

The risk is that the rate will increase still more. Scientists who study the Earth’s history say waters could rise by a foot per decade in a worst-case scenario, though that looks unlikely. Many experts believe that even if emissions stopped tomorrow, 15 or 20 feet of sea level rise is already inevitable, enough to flood many cities unless trillions of dollars are spent protecting them. How long it will take is unclear. But if emissions continue apace, the ultimate rise could be 80 or 100 feet.

4.
Is recent crazy weather tied to climate change?
Some of it is.

Scientists have published strong evidence that the warming climate is making heat waves more frequent and intense. It is also causing heavier rainstorms, and coastal flooding is getting worse as the oceans rise because of human emissions. Global warming has intensified droughts in regions like the Middle East, and it may have strengthened a recent drought in California.

In many other cases, though — hurricanes, for example — the linkage to global warming for particular trends is uncertain or disputed. Scientists are gradually improving their understanding as computer analyses of the climate grow more powerful.

Part 3. What can we do?
1.
Are there any realistic solutions to the problem?
Yes, but change is happening too slowly.

Society has put off action for so long that the risks are now severe, scientists say. But as long as there are still unburned fossil fuels in the ground, it is not too late to act. The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero. The good news is that they are now falling in many countries as a result of programs like fuel-economy standards for cars, stricter building codes and emissions limits for power plants. But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.

2.
What is the Paris Agreement?
Virtually every country agreed to limit future emissions.

The landmark deal was reached outside Paris in December 2015. The reductions are voluntary and the pledges do not do enough to head off severe effects. But the agreement is supposed to be reviewed every few years so that countries ramp up their commitments. President Trump announced in 2017 that he would pull the United States out of the deal, though that will take years, and other countries have said they would go forward regardless of American intentions.

3.
Does clean energy help or hurt the economy?
Job growth in renewable energy is strong.

The energy sources with the lowest emissions include wind turbines, solar panels, hydroelectric dams and nuclear power stations. Power plants burning natural gas also produce fewer emissions than those burning coal. Converting to these cleaner sources may be somewhat costlier in the short term, but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air. And expansion of the market is driving down the costs of renewable energy so fast that it may ultimately beat dirty energy on price alone — it already does in some areas.

The transition to cleaner energy certainly produces losers, like coal companies, but it also creates jobs. The solar industry in the United States now employs more than twice as many people as coal mining.

4.
What about fracking or ‘clean coal’?
Both could help clean up the energy system.

Hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” is one of a set of drilling technologies that has helped produce a new abundance of natural gas in the United States and some other countries. Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run, though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run. The fracking itself can also create local pollution.

“Clean coal” is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground. It has yet to be proven to work economically, but some experts think it could eventually play a major role.

5.
What’s the latest with electric cars?
Sales are still small overall, but they are rising fast.

The cars draw power at night from the electric grid and give off no pollution during the day as they move around town. They are inherently more efficient than gasoline cars and would represent an advance even if the power were generated by burning coal, but they will be far more important as the electric grid itself becomes greener through renewable power. The cars are improving so fast that some countries are already talking about banning the sale of gasoline cars after 2030.

6.
What are carbon taxes, carbon
trading and carbon offsets?
It’s just jargon for putting a price on pollution.

The greenhouse gases being released by human activity are often called “carbon emissions” for short. That is because two of the most important gases, carbon dioxide and methane, contain carbon. (Some other pollutants are lumped into the same category, even if they do not actually contain carbon.) When you hear about carbon taxes, carbon trading and so on, these are just shorthand descriptions of methods to put a price on emissions, which economists say is one of the most important steps society could take to limit them.

7.
Climate change seems so overwhelming.
What can I personally do about it?
Start by sharing this with 50 of your friends.

Experts say the problem can only be solved by large-scale, collective action. Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems, using every tool available and moving as quickly as they can. So the most important thing you can do is to exercise your rights as a citizen, speaking up and demanding change.

You can also take direct personal action to reduce your carbon footprint in simple ways that will save you money. You can plug leaks in your home insulation to save power, install a smart thermostat, switch to more efficient light bulbs, turn off unused lights, drive fewer miles by consolidating trips or taking public transit, waste less food, and eat less meat.

Taking one or two fewer plane rides per year can save as much in emissions as all the other actions combined. If you want to be at the cutting edge, you can look at buying an electric or hybrid car or putting solar panels on your roof. If your state has a competitive electricity market, you may be able to buy 100 percent green power.

Leading corporations, including large manufacturers like carmakers, are starting to demand clean energy for their operations. You can pay attention to company policies, support the companies taking the lead, and let the others know you expect them to do better.

These personal steps may be small in the scheme of things, but they can raise your own consciousness about the problem — and the awareness of the people around you. In fact, discussing this issue with your friends and family is one of the most meaningful things you can do.","high, very_high",Accurate,282,"This article in The New York Times serves as a primer by briefly answering seventeen basic questions about the cause and consequences of—and possible solutions to—climate change.

","Kelly McCusker, Research Associate, Rhodium Group and Climate Impact Lab","The article does a good job of succinctly answering complex questions without misrepresenting the scientific evidence.

","“Climate change? Global warming? What do we call it? […]You can think of global warming as one type of climate change. The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.”","This is a good way to describe the difference in language. It would also be reasonable to say that global warming (the increase in Earth’s average temperature) causes climate change (shifts in the location/frequency/intensity of weather patterns). In practice, the two terms are often used somewhat imprecisely and interchangeably (even in the scientific literature).

","It is also worth noting that global warming refers to global average temperature rising, but this does not necessarily mean that all locations across the globe are warming at all times.",,,“the oceans are rising at an accelerating pace”,"Because more than 90% of the energy added to the climate system is being stored in the ocean, causing sea level rise through thermal expansion.

[…]The number may sound low, but as an average over the surface of an entire planet, it is actually high”","This is an important point. “Global mean temperature” (GMT) is a pretty abstract quantity, since it doesn’t reflect any particular location on Earth. Instead, GMT serves as a useful indicator of how much the Earth’s climate has changed overall. While a helpful statistical construct, it masks the fact that the Earth is warming much faster than the global average in some regions (over land, in the Arctic) than in others (over the oceans).

","Note that the warming over land is about twice as large as the warming over the ocean. Over the ocean, more of the additional heat goes into evaporation of water rather than warming of the air. It furthermore takes time to heat up the oceans, just like a water kettle takes time to boil.

Because there is more land in the Northern Hemisphere, it will warm more than the Southern Hemisphere.

One way to see how much of a difference two degrees makes is to look at a region closer to the equator that is two degrees warmer. Nature will look very different.",,,“We’ve known about [the greenhouse effect] for more than a century.

","Also important is that we have good estimates of how much fossil fuel we have burned, from which one can estimate the CO2 emissions. The increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is about half of those emissions (the rest was taken up by the vegetation and the oceans).

It would have been more accurate to say that we can see that the CO2 increase is from burning fossil fuels by measuring isotopes (differences in the number of nuclear particles of atoms). Not all relevant isotopes are radioactive and the ones that are only a little.",,,,“Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done.”,"“Ever” is a long time, and it’s not clear this is strictly true for the entire length of Earth’s history.

Nope.”,"We are sure that natural factors alone could not have caused the observed warming—without the increase of greenhouse gases there would not be so much warming—but they could have contributed.

For the period 1951 to 2010 our best estimate is that all of the warming was due to human activities. But natural factors could have warmed or cooled the Earth a bit. In the period around 1900, part of the warming was probably natural due to fewer volcanic eruptions and a stronger Sun.

Present-day sea-level rise is a major indicator of climate change. Since the early 1990s, sea level rose at a mean rate of ~3.1 mm/yr (~1 foot over 100 years).

It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100, with the amount of rise dependent on future emissions. The latest IPCC report estimates 1 to more than 3 m (up to ~10 feet) for high emission scenarios by 2300. But, those projections of sea-level rise may be limited by uncertainties surrounding the response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. For example, the report projected a likely contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) of -8 to +15 cm under the high emissions scenario by 2100, but a recent coupled ice sheet and climate dynamics model suggests that the AIS could contribute more than 1 m by 2100, and more than 10 m by 2300, under that high emissions scenario.",,,,“Is recent crazy weather tied to climate change?

","The question of whether global warming will affect the frequency of hurricanes is indeed an open one, and research continues. There is stronger evidence, however, that warming will increase the maximum “intensity ceiling”/intensification rate1 of the strongest storms, the maximum rainfall associated with tropical cyclones2, and the magnitude of oceanic “storm surges”3 that occur in an era of rising seas.

Even emitting only a fraction of the available unburned fossil fuels would eliminate important ecosystems like coral reef habitats. For these ecosystems it will thus be too late. Because part of the CO2 that is emitted will remain in the atmosphere for many centuries, climate change constitutes a cumulative problem. Halting CO2 emissions before the last fossil fuel has been burned thus indeed commits the world to less impacts than the theoretically maximum. However, whether this is not “too late” depends on whether no irreversible or societally unacceptable impacts were reached before that point. The latter requires societal value judgments informed by scientific assessments, but is ultimately not a scientific question.

","This is incorrect, at least if we want to stay anywhere near the 2 degree C target. Especially coal reserves are so abundant (and there is coal gasification and coal liquefaction) that by far the largest part of them have to stay in the ground.",,,“The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero.”,"The current understanding of interactions between the global carbon cycle and the climate system is that when global CO2 emissions are reduced to zero, the warming will remain approximately constant. This is very often confused by estimates of committed “warming in the pipeline” which instead of assuming that global emissions are reduced to zero, assume that concentrations (and therewith to a large degree forcing) are kept constant. Keeping CO2 concentrations constant would require continuous emissions of CO2 that perfectly counter the uptake by natural sinks. If CO2 emissions are reduced to zero, atmospheric CO2 concentrations will gradually decline. For heat-trapping emissions other than CO2, the requirement to reduce them to zero to stabilize warming depends on their residence time in the atmosphere. For gases and particles that only stay in the atmosphere for shorter time periods (days to a decade) achieving constant emissions would also achieve approximately stabilized warming.",,,,"“But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.”

","This is correct. While many countries show gradual declines in their emissions, global emissions are not yet declining. The past few years, global annual CO2 emissions have not increased as much as they did previously and remained roughly constant. However, to halt global mean temperature rise annual CO2 emissions have to become zero.",,,,"“Converting to these cleaner sources [of energy] may be somewhat costlier in the short term, but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air.”","The basic idea of this sentence is correct—that these cleaner sources may be somewhat costlier in the short run, but they also provide benefits that offset the short-run costs. The second part of the sentence is technically correct given that it uses the word “could,” which provides a lot of leeway. A more complete story is that a switch towards these cleaner technologies on the margin for electricity would pay for itself given reasonable estimates of the health costs of fossil fuel generation and the social cost of carbon. It’s also worth noting though that an immediate switch entirely to these technologies would incur transition costs that would likely tip the balance in the cost-benefit analysis, depending on the social cost of carbon used and what sectors we are talking about (are we talking about just electricity? industry? transport?). The vagueness of the statement means that it is less meaningful, but more difficult to critique.

","The article does not mention the huge subsidies to the fossil fuel industry worldwide. According to the World Energy Outlook 2016, fossil-fuel subsidies were around $325 billion in 2015 ($490 billion in 2014) against 150 billion for renewables.",,,"“Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run, though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run.”

","It is arguable whether natural gas is a reasonable solution even in the short run. I argued in favor of this 20 years ago, but nowadays we have to cut emissions more drastically than would be possible by switching to another fossil fuel. The CO2 coefficient of natural gas is still about 2/3 of that of coal. Efficiency factors of power plants are also somewhat better for natural gas than for coal. Overall, we might save a bit more than half of the emissions by switching to natural gas while renewables can save much more. Furthermore, given the long technical lifetime of power stations, the “short run” could easily extend to 2060 or more.",,,,"“‘Clean coal’ is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground.”

","It is important to note that up to the present, the capture of CO2 is not perfect. While theoretically some CO2 emissions could be avoided, a residual amount would still leak into the atmosphere. As CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere, it would either lead to continued (yet slower) warming, or have to be compensated by the active removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, which is also not yet proven to work economically.",,,,“some countries are already talking about banning the sale of gasoline cars after 2030”,It’s not only talk. Great Britain has already decided in favor of such a ban by 2040.,,,,"“Experts say the problem can only be solved by large-scale, collective action”

It cannot be done by only a few nations—it requires collective action to make a substantial difference.,,,,"“Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems, using every tool available and moving as quickly as they can.”

","This is not universally agreed upon by experts. The key issue is that it is imprecisely written. I would not be surprised if the intent is correct. But taking it as it is written, it is not clear what “every tool available” includes. Technically, this should include truly everything, including simply shutting down all manufacturing that uses fossil fuels at all. Banning the driving of any vehicle except electric vehicles run on renewables. Banning flying. I doubt that was the intent of the sentence. The same issue holds for “moving as quickly as they can.” What are the limits to”as quickly as they can”? Does it including shutting down the economy? Or is the intended sentence “moving as quickly as they cost-effectively can”? Thus, in short, while the idea is correct, this is imprecisely worded and can easily be critiqued.

","“Using every tool available” is highly debatable, as even tools which are usually perceived to help mitigating climate (e.g. reforestation), may not result in mitigation effects, depending on how they are implemented. A study on European forests* has shown that afforestation since 1750 was responsible for an increase of 0.12 watts per square meter in the radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere, rather than a decrease, because of management choices.

The report, published in the journal Nature Geoscience on September 18, acknowledges that most of the models of warming trends failed to predict the ""slowdown"" in warming post-2000, resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 ""emissions budget"" for the coming decades. The report in part intends to ""reset"" the estimations for the new predictions on when the earth will hit what the U.N. has determined to be dangerous warming levels.

The team of climate scientists notes that in failing to predict the warming ""hiatus"" in the beginning of the 21st century, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models overestimated temperature increases, consequently setting key benchmarks for warming earlier than they need to be, given the actual numbers.

""The models end up with a warming which is larger than the observed warming for the current emissions,"" University of Exerter's Pierre Friedlingstein, one of the study's authors, told The Washington Post. ""So, therefore, they derive a budget which is much lower,"" he added.

Another co-author, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis' Joeir Rogelj, explained to the Post that the models used by the IPCC have made two mistakes: ""slightly overestimat[ing] historical warming"" and ""underestimat[ing] compatible historical CO2 emissions""

""These two small discrepancies accumulate over time and lead to an slight underestimation of the remaining carbon budget,"" said Rogelj. The new study, he said, attempts to ""reset the uncertainties, starting from where we are today.""

The report follows a study by another team of climate scientists published in June 2017 that likewise determined that the actual increases in warming post-2000 was ""generally smaller than trends estimated"" from the models. Here's the abstract of the study:

In the early twenty-first century, satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi-model ensemble. Because observations and coupled model simulations do not have the same phasing of natural internal variability, such decadal differences in simulated and observed warming rates invariably occur. Here we analyse global-mean tropospheric temperatures from satellites and climate model simulations to examine whether warming rate differences over the satellite era can be explained by internal climate variability alone. We find that in the last two decades of the twentieth century, differences between modelled and observed tropospheric temperature trends are broadly consistent with internal variability. Over most of the early twenty-first century, however, model tropospheric warming is substantially larger than observed; warming rate differences are generally outside the range of trends arising from internal variability. The probability that multi-decadal internal variability fully explains the asymmetry between the late twentieth and early twenty-first century results is low (between zero and about 9%). It is also unlikely that this asymmetry is due to the combined effects of internal variability and a model error in climate sensitivity. We conclude that model overestimation of tropospheric warming in the early twenty-first century is partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations.

The Daily Caller notes a few other reports by climate scientists in the last few years that have likewise underscored the climate models' overestimation of warming, with one determining that the models have predicted 2.5 times more warming than has actually been observed:

Cato Institute scientists Patrick Michaels and Chip Knappenberger have noted the climate models have been over-hyping warming for decades. Scientist John Christy of the University of Alabama-Huntsville has testified before Congress on the matter.

The study suggests that we may have a little more room in the so-called “carbon budget” than previously estimated.

Scientists who reviewed the Daily Wire article found that it greatly misinterpreted the study by saying that it showed that climate projections have overestimated warming. This is incorrect. The study does not conclude that climate models are overly sensitive to warming, or that future warming will be less than projected. Instead, it investigates a discrepancy between the total amount of greenhouse gas emitted since the Industrial Revolution in the models and in the real world. This difference in estimated past emissions affects the study’s calculation of the remaining “carbon budget” for future emissions.

According to the study’s authors, articles implying their work “indicates that global temperatures are not rising as fast as predicted” (as published in Fox News, The Telegraph, The Daily Mail, Breitbart…) do not represent their work. Describing the inaccurate coverage of their study, two of the authors wrote, “Crucially, the reason for the correction [of the carbon budget] was not that we had a new estimate of the climate response, or warming per tonne of CO2 emitted—we used exactly the current consensus range—but that we took better account of past emissions and where human-induced warming has got to already.”

CMIP5 models are on the warm end, yes, but that’s not the main issue here. The article explains that problem comes when looking at both cumulative CO2 emissions and associated warming. The cumulative CO2 emissions simulated by the models only reach 545 GtC (the present-day value) after 2020, by which time the CMIP5 ensemble-mean human- induced warming is over 0.3 ºC warmer than the central estimate for human-induced warming to 2015.",,,,"“The models end up with a warming which is larger than the observed warming for the current emissions.”

","Except that the report (the paper published in Nature Geoscience) never said that. The paper does not describe modelled warming vs. observations over the “hiatus” period.

","Recent media headlines have again discussed the issue of whether climate models are overly sensitive to greenhouse gases. These headlines have misinterpreted a study by Millar et al. which was discussing carbon budgets to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

A recent study by Medhaug et al. analysed the issue of how the models have performed against recent observations at length and largely reconciled the issue. An overly simplistic comparison of simulated global temperatures and observations might suggest that the models were warming too much, but this would be wrong for a number of reasons.

In the Medhaug et al. paper they show the range of models (blue shading in figure with median in light blue), compared with the HadCRUT4 observations and their estimated uncertainty (orange shading with light orange line). There are a number of well understood reasons why the light orange line might not follow the light blue line, namely: radiative forcings, variability, observational biases and choice of reference period.

","Millar et al. (2017) does not mention the “hiatus” nor a slow-down in global warming post 2000, but is instead focused on estimating the remaining carbon budget compatible with remaining below the 1.5 ºC target set by the Paris agreements. Instead of looking at the carbon budget from pre-industrial times to present, the study uses the present decade (2010-2019) as the reference period and asks: How much more CO2 can we emit and remain below an addition 0.6 ºC of warming?

The study found that the remaining carbon budget for the 1.5 ºC target was about ~200 GtC, which is larger than that found using pre-industrial times as the reference period. This implies that either (1) models may underestimate the historical strength of natural carbon sinks, (2) that the historical cumulative CO2 emissions (545±150 GtC, 2 standard deviations) are at the low end of the uncertainty bound, (3) or a combination of these and other factors.

","There is an ongoing discussion about the reasons for models to overestimate the rates of tropospheric temperature in the early 21st century. In a recent study, Santer and colleagues* show that the observed cooling relative to the model predictions could be explained by both internal variability in the climate system (transition to a negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in ca. 1999 and other modes) and by systematic errors in the models’ forcing that lead to an overestimation of the radiative forcing in the early 21st century. These errors include a later start of a minimum in solar cycle activity than have been assumed in CMIP5 simulations, and the cooling effect of both human and natural aerosol emissions. Schmidt and colleagues* have shown that if adjusted for such effects, CMIP5 models reproduced the slow-down of the warming trends (figure below).

There has been a slow-down in global mean surface (troposphere) temperatures, but this does not call into question the fact that the Earth-system as a whole is warming. In fact, during the so-called “hiatus”, the net radiation imbalance in the top of the atmosphere persisted (implying that warming would continue even if emissions were to stop). In fact, at the same time that warming in the troposphere stalled, ocean heat content increased, especially in deeper layers:

The fact that oceans took more heat from the atmosphere helps to explain the slow-down of warming at the surface. This seems to be, at least partly, explained by natural variability in the ocean (see here). Trenberth* argued, thus, that natural variability in the climate system makes the global mean surface temperature record increase in steps, rather than in a linear way. In another study, Yan and colleagues* analysed the redistribution of heat during the “hiatus” period and concluded that: “[…] the term ‘global warming hiatus’ is a misnomer, although we will continue to use the widely used phrase to describe the slowdown or pause in the increase of GMST in the late 20th to early 21st century, with quotation marks. Alternatively, we would like to suggest to the climate community to use ‘global surface warming slowdown’ instead in the future to avoid confusion. There is no absolute consensus on the specific oceanic sink for the excess heat that led to the slowdown in rising GMST (the Southern Ocean may be worth further attention though), but there is a general agreement in this group and in the literature that rather than a ‘global warming hiatus,’ the slowdown of GMST increase in 1998–2013 was a result of the increased uptake of heat energy by the global ocean during those years.”

","Santer et al. (2017)* attributed the small discrepancy between climate model simulated warming and observed warming to differences in scenario forcing. (i.e., the trajectory of CO2, methane, other greenhouse gasses and aerosols) The models were given the forcing that actually transpired between year 2000 and the present day. That is, the study suggested that the discrepancy is not a problem with our models but a problem with measuring emissions of forcing agents and discrepancies between future scenarios and what actually transpired since the scenarios were designed.

We made estimates of the allowable future emissions of carbon before we pass 1.5 ºC. To do this we made assumptions about past warming, exploring different levels of warming from 2015 to address the role of uncertainty in historic warming levels. Readers should note that our method is only one way of computing the budget. The IPCC special report on 1.5 ºC will need to consider it alongside other lines of evidence. The usefulness of the carbon budget concept will also likely be assessed given its inherent uncertainty due to the uncertain historic warming.

I think some press reporting is misleading as our paper did not assess climate impacts or climate model performance. Rather, our paper confirms the need for much increased urgent action from around the world if society stands a chance of limiting warming to 1.5 ºC.

"Global Warming and fire suppression practices boost wildfires in the US West, as correctly reported in The Atlantic
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/global-warming-fire-suppression-practices-boost-wildfires-us-west-correctly-reported-the-atlantic-robinson-meyer/,Has Climate Change Intensified 2017’s Western Wildfires?,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/09/why-is-2017-so-bad-for-wildfires-climate-change/539130/,"This wasn’t supposed to be a bad year for Western wildfires.

Last winter, a weak La Niña bloomed across the Pacific. It sent flume after flume of rain to North America and irrigated half the continent. Water penetrated deep into the soil of Western forests, and mammoth snowdrifts stacked up across the Sierra Nevadas. California’s drought ended in the washout.

Yet fires are now raging across the West. More than two dozen named fires currently burn across Washington and Oregon. More than one million acres have burned in Montana, an area larger than Rhode Island, in the Treasure State’s third-worst fire season on record. And the largest brushfire in the history of Los Angeles currently threatens hundreds of homes in Burbank.

Canada may be experiencing an even worse year for wildfires: 2.86 million acres have burned in British Columbia, the largest area ever recorded in the province.

So what happened? How did a wet Western winter lead to a sky-choking summer?

The answer lies in the summer’s record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts. Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August.

“This will become an important year for [anecdotes about] the importance of temperature. Despite the fact that these forests were really soaked down this winter and spring, these heat waves have dried things out enough to promote really large fires,” says Park Williams, a research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.

“This heat wave is having a way worse influence on fire than it would in absence of human-caused warming.”

In other words, the weeks of heat that baked the West in July and August were enough to wipe away some of the fire-dampening effect of the winter storms.

“The last 60 to 90 days have been exceptionally warm and dry, the perfect recipe for drying out fuels (the one ingredient besides ignitions you need for fire in these systems),” said John Abatzoglou, a professor of geography at the University of Idaho, in an email. “I was running a few numbers this morning, and the last 60 days have been record warm from Spokane, Washington, to Medford, Oregon; both Seattle and Missoula earlier this summer set records for the longest number of days without measurable rain.”

This excessive heat can have an outsize effect on the size of forest fires. For more than three decades, wildfire researchers have known that fire and aridity, which is controlled by heat, exist in an exponential relationship. Every degree of warming does more to promote fire than the previous degree of warming, Williams said.

“Now, thinking about temperature trends due to human-caused climate change, we think that the western United States is 1.5 [degrees] Celsius, or 3 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than it would be in absence of climate change. And there’s a heat wave on top of that,” said Williams. “Because of the exponential influence of temperature, that means that this heat wave is having a way worse influence on fire than it would in absence of human-caused warming.”

In the runaway consequences of each additional degree of warming, wildfires are a “canary in the coal mine” for the effects of climate change, Williams said.

And global warming is already having an effect on wildfire. In a paper published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Williams and Abatzoglou found that the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming.

“The added forest fire area—due to just the degree and a half Celsius of warming—equaled the area of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined,” Williams told me.

The area of annual burned forest in the Pacific Northwest has increased by nearly 5000 percent.

Other researchers have arrived at similar conclusions. A paper published in Science last year found that “large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons.” The mid-1980s is also when most scientists argue that the effects of global warming began to be broadly felt.

The same team of researchers also found that the area of annual burned forest in the Pacific Northwest has increased by nearly 5000 percent since the early 1970s.

Fires have not only been increasing in size due to climate change. In the early 20th century, state and federal governments began aggressively fighting wildfires and trying to keep them as small as possible. This has caused denser and more fire-prone forests than the long-term average for the West, which has led to more massive and uncontrollable fires.

People have also lengthened the season by starting fires—through errant fireworks, unattended campfires, or arson—earlier in the spring and later in the fall. In a human-free environment, fires could only start after a lightning strike, which only follow from summertime thunderstorms.

“Since the 1980s, we’ve only burnt about 10 percent of the western U.S. forests. And that number to me means that there’s still a whole lot more to burn,” Williams said. He estimated that it would take another several decades for that excess century of fuel to burn out of the American woods. And in the meantime, the planet will only get hotter.

“According to climate models, by the end of this century, the western United States is still projected to warm by about another 3.5 degrees Celsius,” he told me. “And when we remember that the relationship between temperature and fire is exponential ... we’re really talking about a very different western United States in 50 years.”",very_high,"Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",126,"This story in The Atlantic describes the conditions that have contributed to this year’s widespread wildfires in the western United States, including the influence of a changing climate.

By Robinson Meyer

Every so often, the worst-case scenario comes to pass.

As of Sunday afternoon, the remnants of Hurricane Harvey seem likely to exceed the worst forecasts that preceded the storm. The entire Houston metropolitan region is flooding: Interstates are under feet of water, local authorities have asked boat owners to join rescue efforts, and most of the streams and rivers near the city are in flood stage.

Some models suggest that the storm will linger over the area until Wednesday night, dumping 50 inches of water in total on Houston and the surrounding area.

“Local rainfall amounts of 50 inches would exceed any previous Texas rainfall record. The breadth and intensity of this rainfall are beyond anything experienced before,” said a statement from the National Weather Service. “Catastrophic flooding is now underway and expected to continue for several days.” (In years of weather reporting, I have never seen a statement this blunt and ominous.)

This means that thousands of people—and perhaps tens of thousands of people—are facing a terrifying and all-too-real struggle to survive right now. In an age when the climate is changing rapidly, a natural question to ask is: What role did human-caused global warming play in strengthening this storm?

Climate scientists, who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole, are often reticent to link any one weather event to global climate change. But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.

It may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength. Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases prevent some of the sun’s rays from bouncing back into space, trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world.

This warmer air causes evaporation to happen faster, which can lead to more moisture in the atmosphere. But that phenomenon alone does not explain climate change’s effects on Harvey.

Storms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of climate change: As the air warms, some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean, which in turn raises the temperature of the sea’s upper layers.

Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm roared toward Houston last week, sea-surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average. These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world. The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours.

“This is the main fuel for the storm,” says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. “Although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].”

This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey’s strangest and scariest behaviors. The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall, achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast. This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico: It may be unique. In the past 30 years of records, no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall.

Harvey is just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms.

Why do storms normally weaken—and why didn’t Harvey? As mentioned above, hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters. But as they grow, their strong winds often pick up seawater, churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface. The same winds also bring newer, colder water closer to the atmosphere, which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm.

That didn’t happen with Harvey. The hurricane churned up water 100 or even 200 meters below the surface, said Trenberth, but this water was still warm—meaning that the storm could keep growing and strengthening. “Harvey was not in a good position to intensify the way it did, because it was so close to land. It’s amazing it was able to do that,” he told me.

All of this said, a storm like Harvey could have happened even if there was no climate change. Planning experts have long fretted over the possibility of a major hurricane striking Houston. Harvey is also a powerful hurricane forming in one of the most hurricane-friendly regions of the world at the peak of hurricane season. Storms similar to it would form in any climate.

But Trenberth says that the extra heat could make the storm more costly and more powerful, overpowering and eventually breaking local drainage systems.

“The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm,” he said. “It may have been a strong storm, and it may have caused a lot of problems anyway—but [human-caused climate change] amplifies the damage considerably.”

More generally, it’s still unclear what effect climate change is having on hurricane formation across the greater Atlantic Ocean. A draft version of a major U.S. government review of climate science due out later this year says there is “medium confidence” that human activities “have contributed to the observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s.”

Houston has been ground zero for super-damaging storms lately. It has seen four 100-year flooding events since the spring of 2015, according to the meteorologist Eric Holthaus. The city also sees 167 percent more heavy downpours than it did in the 1950s. Meanwhile, only one-sixth of its residents have federal flood insurance, though that program has struggled to adjust to the increased flooding risk associated with climate change.

Yet even compared to recent storms, Harvey is unprecedented—just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms. Harvey has already dumped more water on Harris County than Tropical Storm Allison, the area’s previous worst-ever flooding disaster in 2001, though it has only lasted half the time of that earlier storm.

And it will keep raining. As of Sunday afternoon, Buffalo Bayou, a major river near downtown Houston, is one foot above flood stage. It is projected to rise as much as another 12 feet today alone.","high, very_high",Insightful,86,"This article in The Atlantic attempted to investigate what can be said about the relationship between Tropical Storm Harvey and climate change. Harvey’s record rainfall totals around Houston, Texas are partly the result of how long it has persisted in the same location, making it an unusual storm.

Scientists who reviewed the article indicated that it provides an accurate summary of how tropical cyclones are expected to change due to global warming, as well as what aspects of Harvey do not have clearly understood relationships with climate change.

","Overall I think it’s a well written article that captures the essence of our understanding that under climate change storms will likely bring more rainfall. In the case of Harvey, all we can say is that it is consistent with those ideas. But we cannot say that it is the direct consequence of climate change.","Dan Chavas, Assistant Professor, Purdue University","One must be careful not to assume that warmer waters automatically make all aspects of extreme weather worse. Though for a given storm we do expect rainfall rates to increase at a warmer sea surface temperature, how storm size, regional counts, and track characteristics (e.g. the likelihood that a storm will become nearly stationary as was the case with Harvey) will change in a warmer world are much less well ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“But [climate scientists] say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.”

","This is a reasonable statement. As tropical cyclones are such complex events— the confluence of many factors coming together—it is difficult to estimate the climate change role in such events. However, it is likely that human-caused climate change has worsened aspects of this event as described later in the article.

","It is true that for a Harvey-like event—a storm at this location in East Texas that is nearly stationary—global warming likely increases the total rainfall. But we do not know whether global warming makes it more likely for a Harvey-like events to occur in the first place. Risk combines both of these probabilities. In combination, then, it is difficult to say whether there is a climate change effect on this type of flood risk.

",,,“The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm”,"Climate change doesn’t cause events like this, but probably makes them worse by making storms (which are strong to begin with) more intense and enhancing rainfall in that process. I don’t think anyone can say with confidence that climate change has made tropical cyclones worse. There’s too much natural variability (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, etc.) and the sample size of intense hurricanes is small. It is consistent with what’s predicted for the future, though. However, I’m not exactly sure where the “30 percent” number comes from for the human contribution to rainfall. For every one degree increase in sea surface temperature, the saturation vapor pressure increases by about 7% based on the “Clausius-Clapeyron” equation. There’s also an assumption that hurricanes will likely get stronger because of climate change, so perhaps the stronger winds will also increase evaporation.

","A reference here would have been useful as it’s unclear exactly where this number comes from. We know that human-caused climate change can increase both the moisture content of the atmosphere, as described by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, and the energetics of the storm, as there is increased latent heat release. Both of these climate change-influenced drivers have the potential to cause increased precipitation.

","Again, it is true that in a warmer world we expect the rain rate to increase significantly. (I am not sure about the 30% specifically, but that doesn’t matter.) Thus, given the existence of a Harvey-like storm—a storm at this location in East Texas that is nearly stationary—global warming likely significantly increases the total rainfall.

However, there is a second probability to account for: how likely is it for a Harvey-like event to occur in the first place? This is a much more difficult probability to assess and we do not know how climate change affects it.

Risk combines these two probabilities. As a result, it is difficult to say whether there is a climate change effect on the likelihood of a flood event of this magnitude.",,"“The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours.”

","This storm was quite remarkable in its intensification. It does seem likely that the warmth of the surface and sub-surface waters, primarily linked to variability but also with a small climate change contribution, enhanced the storm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sea ice and wildlife habitat are disappearing; higher sea levels threaten coastal native villages.

But to the scientists from Woods Hole Research Center who have come here to study the effects of climate change, the most urgent is the fate of permafrost, the always-frozen ground that underlies much of the state.

Starting just a few feet below the surface and extending tens or even hundreds of feet down, it contains vast amounts of carbon in organic matter — plants that took carbon dioxide from the atmosphere centuries ago, died and froze before they could decompose. Worldwide, permafrost is thought to contain about twice as much carbon as is currently in the atmosphere.

Once this ancient organic material thaws, microbes convert some of it to carbon dioxide and methane, which can flow into the atmosphere and cause even more warming. Scientists have estimated that the process of permafrost thawing could contribute as much as 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit to global warming over the next several centuries, independent of what society does to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels and other activities.

In Alaska, nowhere is permafrost more vulnerable than here, 350 miles south of the Arctic Circle, in a vast, largely treeless landscape formed from sediment brought down by two of the state’s biggest rivers, the Yukon and the Kuskokwim. Temperatures three feet down into the frozen ground are less than half a degree below freezing. This area could lose much of its permafrost by midcentury.

That, said Max Holmes, senior scientist and deputy director of the research center, “has all kinds of consequences both locally for this region, for the animals and the people who live here, as well as globally.”

“It’s sobering to think of this magnificent landscape and how fundamentally it can change over a relatively short time period,” he added.

But on this wide, flat tundra, it takes a practiced eye to see how Alaska is thawing from below.

At one of the countless small lakes that pepper the region, chunks of shoreline that include what had been permafrost have calved off toward the water.

Nearby, across a spongy bed of mosses and lichens, a small boggy depression most likely formed when the ice in the top layers of the permafrost below it melted to water.

In July, the Woods Hole scientists, along with 13 undergraduate and graduate students working on projects of their own, set up a temporary field station on a nameless lake 60 miles northwest of Bethel, which with a population of 6,000 is the largest town in the region. They drilled permafrost cores with a power auger, took other sediment and water samples and embedded temperature probes in the frozen ground. Later, back in the lab at Woods Hole, they began the process of analyzing the samples for carbon content and nutrients.

The goal is to better understand how thawing permafrost affects the landscape and, ultimately, how much and what mix of greenhouse gases is released.

“In order to know how much is lost, you have to know how much is there,” said Sue Natali, a Woods Hole scientist and permafrost expert.

Even in colder northern Alaska, where permafrost in some parts of the North Slope extends more than 2,100 feet below the surface, scientists are seeing stark changes. Vladimir E. Romanovsky, a permafrost researcher at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, said that temperatures at a depth of 65 feet have risen by 3 degrees Celsius (about 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit) over decades.

Near-surface changes have been even greater. At one northern site, he said, permafrost temperatures at shallow depths have climbed from minus 8 degrees Celsius to minus 3.

“Minus 3 is not that far from zero,” Dr. Romanovsky said. If emissions and warming continue at the same rate, he said, near-surface temperatures will rise above freezing around the middle of the century.

There is plenty of debate among scientists about when and how much of Alaska’s permafrost will thaw. And there is no doubt that thawing of the full depth of permafrost would take millenniums.

But Dr. Romanovsky said that his and others’ work shows that permafrost “is not as stable as people thought.”

In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, thawing wreaks havoc on infrastructure, causing slumping of land when ice loses volume as it turns to water.

The main road in Bethel, where average temperatures have risen about 4 degrees Fahrenheit since the mid-20th century, is more of a washboard than a thoroughfare because of shifting ground. Building foundations in Bethel move and crack as well. Some roads, airport runways and parking areas have to be reinforced with liquid-filled pipes that transfer heat out of the permafrost to keep the ground from slumping.

The thawing of permafrost is a gradual process. Ground is fully frozen in winter, and begins to thaw from the top down as air temperatures rise in spring. As average temperatures increase over years, this thawed, or active, layer can increase in depth.

At the field station, the researchers are especially interested in how wildfires affect the permafrost. Because burning removes some of the vegetation that acts as insulation, the theory is that burning should cause permafrost to thaw more.

Parts of the tundra here burned in the 1970s and in the summer of 2015, so the researchers took cores from both burned and unburned areas. Scientists wrestled with the bulky power auger as its stainless steel tube worked its way into the hard permafrost. Cores — often containing thin layers of solid ice — were labeled, packed in a cooler and sent by helicopter to a freezer in Bethel.

Thawing permafrost underneath or at the edge of a lake can cause it to drain like a leaky bathtub. Thawing elsewhere can bring about small elevation changes that can in turn lead to changes in water flow through the landscape, drying out some parts of the tundra and turning others into bogs.

Beyond the local effects on plant and animal life, the landscape changes can have an important climate change impact, by altering the mix of carbon dioxide and methane that is emitted. Although methane does not persist in the atmosphere for as long as carbon dioxide, it has a far greater heat-trapping ability and can contribute to more rapid warming.

So the researchers devote much of their time to studying the flow of water and the carbon and nutrients it contains.

“It’s one of the big questions to tackle – what’s wet and dry now, and what will be wet and dry in the future,” Dr. Natali said. If the decomposing permafrost is wet, there will be less oxygen available to the microbes, so they will produce more methane. If the permafrost is dry, the decomposition will lead to more carbon dioxide.

Estimates vary on how much carbon is currently released from thawing permafrost worldwide, but by one calculation emissions over the rest of the century could average about 1.5 billion tons a year, or about the same as current annual emissions from fossil-fuel burning in the United States.

Already, thawing permafrost and warmer temperatures are being blamed for rising carbon emissions in the Alaskan tundra, both here and farther north. In a study earlier this year, researchers found that bacterial decomposition of thawed permafrost, as well as carbon dioxide produced by living vegetation, continues later into the fall because freezing of the surface is delayed.

The rise in emissions has been so significant, the researchers found, that Alaska may be shifting from a sink, or storehouse, of carbon, to a net source.

Dr. Holmes said that shift was not surprising given the climate trend, and he would expect that sub-Arctic parts of Siberia, Canada and other areas with permafrost may be undergoing similar changes.

“There’s a massive amount of carbon that’s in the ground, that’s built up slowly over thousands and thousands of years,” he said.

“It’s been in a freezer, and that freezer is now turning into a refrigerator.”","high, very_high","Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning, Unbiased",180,"This story in the New York Times looks at the thawing trend of permafrost (permanently frozen soil and sediment) in Alaska as the region warms due to climate change, and the potential for this landscape to be an additional source of greenhouse gases in the future, which would further amplify global warming.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that it accurately represented current research on the region, which shows that Alaska’s area of permafrost is shrinking as more and more ground thaws. This destabilizes the land surface, damaging buildings and infrastructure, and allows frozen organic matter to decay. Given the uncertainty in future projections of greenhouse gases released by thawing permafrost, however, providing more information than just the upper end of the range could help readers understand this feedback more clearly.

This is part of a series of reviews of 2017’s most popular climate stories on social media.

","This article accurately represents the state of our knowledge on permafrost thaw and carbon dynamics, and it conveys why this is an important issue to study for the future state of our planet.

I take slight issue with the description of the age of the permafrost (“centuries”); the author could have gone bolder and said centuries to many millennia, since permafrost carbon age can range from a few centuries to as old or older than the last glacial maximum (20,000 years ago).

Permafrost thaw is described as gradual and “top down”, which is definitely true, but it’s not the only way it thaws. It can thaw laterally, from below, and much faster than gradually.

",,,,"Ben Poulter, Research Scientist, NASA
","The observations being made by Woods Hole Research Center researchers on the thawing of permafrost is consistent with other ecosystem changes taking place in the region that are related to climate change. These include increased growing season length, decreasing arctic sea ice, disruptions to infrastructure, and changes in wildlife populations. The main uncertainty (which this work contributes to reducing) is related to how strong the permafrost-climate feedback is, and how continued climate change will destabilize the high-arctic frozen soils.

","Andrew MacDougall, Assistant Professor, St. Francis Xavier University
","Overall the article does a good job of summarizing the potential effects of the permafrost carbon feedback to climate change. However, the article highlights the very upper-end of the estimated strength of the feedback instead of giving the most likely values or ranges.

"Forbes article accurately describes research on Atlantic ocean circulation weakening, but headline goes farther
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/forbes-article-accurately-describes-research-atlantic-ocean-circulation-weakening-headline-goes-farther-trevor-nace/,Global Ocean Circulation Appears To Be Collapsing Due To A Warming Planet,https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/08/03/global-ocean-circulation-appears-to-be-collapsing-due-to-a-warming-planet/#8a42b28f6f40,"Scientists have long known about the anomalous ""warming hole"" in the North Atlantic Ocean, an area immune to warming of Earth's oceans. This cool zone in the North Atlantic Ocean appears to be associated with a slowdown in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), one of the key drivers in global ocean circulation.

A recent study published in Nature outlines research by a team of Yale University and University of Southhampton scientists. The team found evidence that Arctic ice loss is potentially negatively impacting the planet's largest ocean circulation system. While scientists do have some analogs as to how this may impact the world, we will be largely in uncharted territory.

AMOC is one of the largest current systems in the Atlantic Ocean and the world. Generally speaking, it transports warm and salty water northward from the tropics to South and East of Greenland. This warm water cools to ambient water temperature then sinks as it is saltier and thus denser than the relatively more fresh surrounding water. The dense mass of water sinks to the base of the North Atlantic Ocean and is pushed south along the abyss of the Atlantic Ocean.

This process whereby water is transported into the Northern Atlantic Ocean acts to distribute ocean water globally. What's more important, and the basis for concern of many scientists is this mechanism is one of the most efficient ways Earth transports heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes. The warm water transported from the tropics to the North Atlantic releases heat to the atmosphere, playing a key role in warming of western Europe. You likely have heard of one of the more popular components of the AMOC, the Gulf Stream which brings warm tropical water to the western coasts of Europe.

Evidence is growing that the comparatively cold zone within the Northern Atlantic could be due to a slowdown of this global ocean water circulation. Hence, a slowdown in the planet's ability to transfer heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes. The cold zone could be due to melting of ice in the Arctic and Greenland. This would cause a cold fresh water cap over the North Atlantic, inhibiting sinking of salty tropical waters. This would in effect slow down the global circulation and hinder the transport of warm tropical waters north.

Melting of the Arctic sea ice has rapidly increased in the recent decades. Satellite image records indicate that September Arctic sea ice is 30% less today than it was in 1979. This trend of increased sea ice melting during summer months does not appear to be slowing. Hence, indications are that we will see a continued weakening of the global ocean circulation system.

This scenario of a collapse in AMOC and global ocean circulation is the premise for the movie ""The Day After Tomorrow."" As a disclaimer, the plot line in which much of New England and Western Europe gets plunged into an ice age is significantly over exaggerated and unrealistic on human time scales.

While geologists have studied events in the past similar to what appears to be happening today, scientists are largely unsure of what lies ahead.",high,Accurate,242,"This article at Forbes describes a study on the possible influence of Arctic sea ice loss on recent changes to a key portion of ocean circulation in the Atlantic Ocean. This Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) transports heat around the North Atlantic, but could be slowing down as a result of climate change, with consequences for regional temperatures in Europe and eastern North America.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that it accurately summarized research on the topic of the AMOC. However, the headline used stronger wording than the article, stating that “global ocean circulation appears to be collapsing due to a warming planet”. That is misleading, as this research is analyzing a weakening of the circulation pattern, but not something as extreme as a “collapse”.

","I find the article is a very accurate summary of the state of science, with the exception of the word “collapsing” in the headline (which may well have been not the author’s choice). Changing this word to “weakening” would have left me with nothing to complain about.

",,,,"Dan Jones, Physical Oceanographer, British Antarctic Survey
","This is an accurate, concise summary of the slowdown of the AMOC and its possible future states. There are a couple of minor issues—specifically, one of the links goes to an irrelevant article, and it would be useful to have a couple more citations to the scientific literature. The title is possibly a little overstated—I might instead say that the AMOC is at risk of collapsing in a warming world.

","Alek Petty, Postdoctoral associate, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
","I think the article did a pretty good job of summarizing the main findings of this paper (and other recent studies on this theme), while adding some appropriate disclaimers.

The main issue I had was with the headline. The weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation isn’t exactly a collapse of the global ocean circulation, and the author makes a point of the high uncertainty that remains regarding the significance of this result towards the end of the story.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Global Ocean Circulation Appears To Be Collapsing Due To A Warming Planet”
","I’m a little hesitant about the title. The slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is not the same thing as the “collapse of global ocean circulation”. It might be more accurate to say that the AMOC is at risk of collapsing in a warming world.

Also, it’s worth noting that although we understand that there is a connection between AMOC and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the mechanisms involved in this connection are still under investigation.",,,,“Evidence is growing that the comparatively cold zone within the Northern Atlantic could be due to a slowdown of this global ocean water circulation.”,"For example, this study:

"Wall Street Journal op-ed on economic consequences of climate change found naive by scientists
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-op-ed-economic-consequences-climate-change-found-naive-scientists-david-henderson-john-cochrane/,Climate Change Isn’t the End of the World,https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-change-isnt-the-end-of-the-world-1501446277,"Climate change is often misunderstood as a package deal: If global warming is “real,”
both sides of the debate seem to assume, the climate lobby’s policy agenda follows
inexorably.
It does not. Climate policy advocates need to do a much better job of quantitatively
analyzing economic costs and the actual, rather than symbolic, benefits of their policies.
Skeptics would also do well to focus more attention on economic and policy analysis.
To arrive at a wise policy response, we first need to consider how much economic
damage climate change will do. Current models struggle to come up with economic costs
commensurate with apocalyptic political rhetoric. Typical costs are well below 10% of
gross domestic product in the year 2100 and beyond.
That’s a lot of money—but it’s a lot of years, too. Even 10% less GDP in 100 years
corresponds to 0.1 percentage point less annual GDP growth. Climate change therefore
does not justify policies that cost more than 0.1 percentage point of growth. If the goal is
10% more GDP in 100 years, pro-growth tax, regulatory and entitlement reforms would
be far more effective.
Yes, the costs are not evenly spread. Some places will do better and some will do worse.
The American South might be a worse place to grow wheat; Southern Canada might be a
better one. In a century, Miami might find itself in approximately the same situation as
the Dutch city of Rotterdam today.
But spread over a century, the costs of moving and adapting are not as imposing as they
seem. Rotterdam’s dikes are expensive, but not prohibitively so. Most buildings are
rebuilt about every 50 years. If we simply stopped building in flood-prone areas and
started building on higher ground, even the costs of moving cities would be bearable.
Migration is costly. But much of the world’s population moved from farms to cities in
the 20th century. Allowing people to move to better climates in the 21st will be equally
possible. Such investments in climate adaptation are small compared with the
investments we will regularly make in houses, businesses, infrastructure and education.
And economics is the central question—unlike with other environmental problems such
as chemical pollution. Carbon dioxide hurts nobody’s health. It’s good for plants.
Climate change need not endanger anyone. If it did—and you do hear such claims—then
living in hot Arizona rather than cool Maine, or living with Louisiana’s frequent floods,
would be considered a health catastrophe today.
Global warming is not the only risk our society faces. Even if science tells us that climate
change is real and man-made, it does not tell us, as President Obama asserted, that
climate change is the greatest threat to humanity. Really? Greater than nuclear
explosions, a world war, global pandemics, crop failures and civil chaos?
No. Healthy societies do not fall apart over slow, widely predicted, relatively small
economic adjustments of the sort painted by climate analysis. Societies do fall apart
from war, disease or chaos. Climate policy must compete with other long-term threats
for always-scarce resources.
Facing this reality, some advocate that we buy some “insurance.” Sure, they argue, the
projected economic cost seems small, but it could turn out to be a lot worse. But the
same argument applies to any possible risk. If you buy overpriced insurance against
every potential danger, you soon run out of money. You can sensibly insure only when
the premium is in line with the risk—which brings us back where we started, to the need
for quantifying probabilities, costs, benefits and alternatives. And uncertainty goes both
ways. Nobody forecast fracking, or that it would make the U.S. the world’s carbonreduction leader. Strategic waiting is a rational response to a slow-moving uncertain
peril with fast-changing technology.
Global warming is not even the obvious top environmental threat. Dirty water, dirty air
and insect-borne diseases are a far greater problem today for most people world-wide.
Habitat loss and human predation are a far greater problem for most animals. Elephants
won’t make it to see a warmer climate. Ask them how they would prefer to spend $1
trillion—subsidizing high-speed trains or a human-free park the size of Montana.
Then, we need to know what effect proposed policies have and at what cost. Scientific,
quantifiable or even vaguely plausible cause-and-effect thinking are missing from much
advocacy for policies to reduce carbon emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change’s “scientific” recommendations, for example, include “reduced gender
inequality & marginalization in other forms,” “provisioning of adequate housing,” “cash
transfers” and “awareness raising & integrating into education.” Even if some of these
are worthy goals, they are not scientifically valid, cost-benefit-tested policies to cool the
planet.
Climate policy advocates’ apocalyptic vision demands serious analysis, and mushy
thinking undermines their case. If carbon emissions pose the greatest threat to
humanity, it follows that the costs of nuclear power—waste disposal and the occasional
meltdown—might be bearable. It follows that the costs of genetically modified foods and
modern pesticides, which can feed us with less land and lower carbon emissions, might
be bearable. It follows that if the future of civilization is really at stake, adaptation or
geo-engineering should not be unmentionable. And it follows that symbolic, ineffective,
political grab-bag policies should be intolerable.

professor at the Naval Postgraduate School. Mr. Cochrane is a senior fellow of the Hoover
Institution and an adjunct scholar of the Cato Institute.","low, very_low","Biased, Misleading",236,"This Wall Street Journal commentary by David Henderson and John Cochrane argues that the world would be better off adapting to climate change than eliminating the greenhouse gas emissions that cause warming. Scientists who reviewed this article found that it does so by ignoring most climate impacts apart from estimates of Gross Domestic Product change, by using only the most optimistic estimates of this economic loss, and by focusing on adaptation possibilities in high-income nations like the United States.

Climate change could have a much larger economic impact, along with impacts on the spread of human disease, food security, extreme weather, and marine ecosystems, for example.

",,,,,"Aaron Bernstein, Associate Director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment, Boston Children’s Hospital, Harvard:","Although many claims in this op-ed don’t mesh with reality, the most concerning delusion presented is that the health costs of climate change are both known and manageable. Legitimate economic analyses have put the costs of climate change at 2100 to GDP at several percent to more than 20%[1], with the variability largely due to different discount rates. Simply put, the more you care about children, the more expensive climate change becomes. Even these higher damage estimates may fail to capture the full costs of extreme events over time, as Martin Weitzman’s work has shown. But there’s another, and more difficult, rub. What if we don’t understand the full consequences of greenhouse gas emissions? Consider ocean acidification, which is a direct consequence of higher atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The higher acid content in the world’s oceans has already begun to interfere with marine life, including fish reproduction. Research has just begun to explore the reverberations of ocean acidification to human nutrition (and consequently risk of migration and conflict). Economists do not include these massive externalities in their estimates because they have yet to be quantified. If we underestimate climate damages, we won’t simply have a costly externality kicked down the road for our children to deal with. We might not have a viable planet, and without a second planet in the wings, betting the viability of the world on a few uncertain economic analyses seems like an act of utter folly. We must, of course, make trade-offs in where we put our money but doing so based on the face value of current economic evaluations—especially those based on GDP which is generally regarded as a poor measure of economic health—gives catastrophic error too great a chance. A better approach would be to focus on implementing carbon prices that will limit greenhouse gas emissions to levels that will prevent levels of warming that the scientific community and most nations on earth have deemed potentially disastrous for human civilization.

","This is a very simplistic, almost naive op-ed on climate change impacts. Some assertions such as the one about CO2 being good for plants demonstrates that the authors do not know or understand how increasing CO2 is good or bad for plants, they are just repeating something they heard. The idea that Miami is going to build a dike like Rotterdam is almost laughable. Of course climate change is not the only risk to society, but it is the biggest environmental risk. And most large buildings (e.g. Empire State Building) are not rebuilt every 50 years, only smaller, more expendable ones are.

","The article plays down impacts of climate change that most studies consider to be highly important: e.g. the death toll of heat waves, hazards to coastlines, costs and friction of migration and other adaptation. While it is true that climate change is not the only risk our society faces, economic studies suggest that the risks of climate change are important, especially in certain economic segments (e.g. agriculture, health) and for low income countries with low capacity for adaptation. The article fails to mention that hazards and distributive issues of climate change increase all the other risks that the authors itemize, “nuclear explosions, a world war, global pandemics, crop failures and civil chaos”, even if it is not yet clear to what extent.

","Verena Schoepf, Research Associate, The University of Western Australia
","The authors seem unaware of many consequences of climate change, particularly related to the ocean. The increase in ocean acidity and temperature, due to uptake of atmospheric CO2, will have tremendous consequences for many marine organisms and thus ultimately humans via sea level rise, impacts on weather and climate, food security, etc.

","Wolfgang Cramer, Professor, Directeur de Recherche, Mediterranean Institute for Biodiversity and Ecology (IMBE)
","This article argues that policies concerning climate change need to differentiate between different objectives and instruments and also says that, in some sectors such as built infrastructure, adaptation may be less costly than what is conventionally assumed. While this may be true as a general statement (and nothing is new about it), the article creates confusion rather than clarification by focusing only on the few sectors where, in a “North American world” unaware of any poor countries, adaptation can be achieved at manageable cost. The article does not ask the question how other sectors besides the construction sector might fare under significant warming, nor how low-income people (inside or outside North America) would be affected. It also avoids speaking about the major economic and socio-political disruptions of the world being caused by warming and sea-level rise in developing countries.

Climate change need not endanger anyone”,"By this logic, the authors would gladly drink water endlessly, in the belief that as a harmless—even potentially beneficial—substance, doing so could never hurt them. Unfortunately for them they’d die from having so wrecked their bodies’ chemistry. Carbon dioxide, like water, isn’t acutely toxic to people (though it does appear to slow our brains down). But the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is already 50% higher than at any point in modern human existence. The harms that result from this change to the planets chemistry are many and well described in, among other places, the U.S. National Climate Assessment.

"2017 is on track to be among the hottest year recorded, scientists are not as surprised as ThinkProgress article suggests
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/2017-track-among-hottest-year-recorded-scientists-not-surprised-thinkprogress-article-suggests-joe-romm/,2017 is so unexpectedly warm it is freaking out climate scientists,https://archive.thinkprogress.org/no-el-nino-still-hot-39162a5cc5bc/,"Normally, the hottest years on record occur when the underlying human-caused global warming trend gets a temporary boost from an El Niño’s enhanced warming in the tropical Pacific.

So it’s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported Tuesday that the first half of 2017 was the second-warmest January-June on record for Earth, topped only by 2016, which was boosted by one of the biggest El Niños on record.

“As if it wasn’t shocking enough to see three consecutive record-breaking years, in 2014, 2015, and 2016, for the first time on record,” leading climatologist Michael Mann wrote in an email to ThinkProgress, “we’re now seeing near-record temperatures even in the absence of the El Nino ‘assist’ that the previous record year benefited from.”

NOAA climatologist Ahira Sanchez-Lugo told Climate Central, “After the decline of the strong El Niño, I was expecting the values to drop a bit…. This year has been extremely remarkable.”

Usually we see global records in years when the short-term El Niño warming adds to the long-term global warming trend (see chart below). As NOAA noted in its March report, without an El Niño, no month before March 2017 had ever exceeded the “normal” temperature (the 1981–2010 average) by a full 1.8°F (1.0°C).

Global monthly temperature departures (from 1981–2010 average) color-coded by whether the Pacific was experiencing an El Niño (red), a La Niña (blue) or neutral conditions (gray).

This matters because when a month — or six-month period — sees record high global temperatures in the absence of an El Niño, that is a sign the underlying global warming trend is stronger than ever. The latest NOAA report is “a reminder that climate change has not, despite the insistence of climate contrarians ‘paused’ or even slowed down,” Mann said.

Bottom line: Human-caused global warming continues at a dangerous pace, and only human action to slash carbon pollution can stop it.",high,Accurate,121,"ThinkProgress published a brief but influential article commenting on record warm global temperature over the first half of 2017. The scientists who have reviewed the article confirm it accurately reports that 2017 is on track to being one of the warmest years on record.

","While generally accurate, the article may overstate how unusual 2017 is shaping up to be. It is very unlikely to set a new temperature record in any of the different global surface temperature datasets (NOAA, NASA, Hadley, Berkeley Earth), and is likely to either be the second or third warmest on record. If 2017 temperatures end up comparable to or slightly below 2015, a year where the El Niño contribution was not that large, 2017 temperatures will be quite warm but “extremely remarkable” might be overstating the case a bit.

However, even if temperatures end up being below 2015, the year 2017 will likely be a bit warmer than we’d naively expect simply based on the past warming trend:

","Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany
","The large variety of comical claims that scientists are surprised 2017 will be warm is somewhat annoying, (the Earth is warming, every year will normally be among the warmest recorded) but the facts are otherwise right.

","Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of Exeter
","This article is factually correct in terms of the presentation of the data, but the claim that this is “a surprise to climate scientists” is not correct. The article seems to have been written without awareness of some important and relevant climate science. In December 2016, climate scientists at the UK’s Met Office Hadley Centre predicted that 2017 would be “another very warm year for global temperatures” – see MetOffice news release.

I’m giving this a rating of 0 (neutral) because although the scientific content of the article is correct, the headline that this is “unexpected” is incorrect.
","Eric Guilyardi, CNRS Research Director, Université Pierre et Marie Curie & Professor, University of Reading
","This article rightly explains that El Niño events, which see the tropical Pacific – a quarter of the planet’s surface – warm by a few degrees celsius, boost the global surface temperature by a few tenth of a degree.

"Scientists explain what New York Magazine article on “The Uninhabitable Earth” gets wrong
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-explain-what-new-york-magazine-article-on-the-uninhabitable-earth-gets-wrong-david-wallace-wells/,The Uninhabitable Earth,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html,"I. ‘Doomsday’
Peering beyond scientific reticence.

It is, I promise, worse than you think. If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible, even within the lifetime of a teenager today. And yet the swelling seas — and the cities they will drown — have so dominated the picture of global warming, and so overwhelmed our capacity for climate panic, that they have occluded our perception of other threats, many much closer at hand. Rising oceans are bad, in fact very bad; but fleeing the coastline will not be enough.

Indeed, absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century.

Even when we train our eyes on climate change, we are unable to comprehend its scope. This past winter, a string of days 60 and 70 degrees warmer than normal baked the North Pole, melting the permafrost that encased Norway’s Svalbard seed vault — a global food bank nicknamed “Doomsday,” designed to ensure that our agriculture survives any catastrophe, and which appeared to have been flooded by climate change less than ten years after being built.

The Doomsday vault is fine, for now: The structure has been secured and the seeds are safe. But treating the episode as a parable of impending flooding missed the more important news. Until recently, permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists, because, as the name suggests, it was soil that stayed permanently frozen. But Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth’s atmosphere. When it thaws and is released, that carbon may evaporate as methane, which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a century; when judged on the timescale of two decades, it is 86 times as powerful. In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.

Maybe you know that already — there are alarming stories in the news every day, like those, last month, that seemed to suggest satellite data showed the globe warming since 1998 more than twice as fast as scientists had thought (in fact, the underlying story was considerably less alarming than the headlines). Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this, it may already have met the open water, where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a process known poetically as “calving.”

But no matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough. Over the past decades, our culture has gone apocalyptic with zombie movies and Mad Max dystopias, perhaps the collective result of displaced climate anxiety, and yet when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers, we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination. The reasons for that are many: the timid language of scientific probabilities, which the climatologist James Hansen once called “scientific reticence” in a paper chastising scientists for editing their own observations so conscientiously that they failed to communicate how dire the threat really was; the fact that the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn’t even see warming as a problem worth addressing; the way that climate denialism has made scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings; the simple speed of change and, also, its slowness, such that we are only seeing effects now of warming from decades past; our uncertainty about uncertainty, which the climate writer Naomi Oreskes in particular has suggested stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a median outcome were even possible; the way we assume climate change will hit hardest elsewhere, not everywhere; the smallness (two degrees) and largeness (1.8 trillion tons) and abstractness (400 parts per million) of the numbers; the discomfort of considering a problem that is very difficult, if not impossible, to solve; the altogether incomprehensible scale of that problem, which amounts to the prospect of our own annihilation; simple fear. But aversion arising from fear is a form of denial, too.

In between scientific reticence and science fiction is science itself. This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change. What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response. Instead, it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action. It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized, largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency. But those scenarios, and not the present climate, are the baseline. In fact, they are our schedule.

The present tense of climate change — the destruction we’ve already baked into our future — is horrifying enough. Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we’ll lose them within the century, even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade. Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe: tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world. Now two degrees is our goal, per the Paris climate accords, and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports, often called the “gold standard” of climate research; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century, should we stay the present course. But that’s just a median projection. The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven’t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt. The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere). Each of these promises to accelerate warming, and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years. The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.*

The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now, each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock, and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into. Unless you are a teenager, you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids. In fact, all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas. The most notorious was 252 million years ago; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead. We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate; by most estimates, at least ten times faster. The rate is accelerating. This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said, this spring, that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive, and what drove Elon Musk, last month, to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years. These are nonspecialists, of course, and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I. But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field, few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion, too: No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.

Over the past few decades, the term “Anthropocene” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now, and a way to signal that it is a new era, defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention. One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature (and even echoes the biblical “dominion”). And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world, which we surely have, it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it, engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries, perhaps until it destroys us. That is what Wallace Smith Broecker, the avuncular oceanographer who coined the term “global warming,” means when he calls the planet an “angry beast.” You could also go with “war machine.” Each day we arm it more.

II. Heat Death
The bahraining of New York.

Humans, like all mammals, are heat engines; surviving means having to continually cool off, like panting dogs. For that, the temperature needs to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of refrigerant, drawing heat off the skin so the engine can keep pumping. At seven degrees of warming, that would become impossible for large portions of the planet’s equatorial band, and especially the tropics, where humidity adds to the problem; in the jungles of Costa Rica, for instance, where humidity routinely tops 90 percent, simply moving around outside when it’s over 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be lethal. And the effect would be fast: Within a few hours, a human body would be cooked to death from both inside and out.

Climate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled many times before, but the climate window that has allowed for human life is very narrow, even by the standards of planetary history. At 11 or 12 degrees of warming, more than half the world’s population, as distributed today, would die of direct heat. Things almost certainly won’t get that hot this century, though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually. This century, and especially in the tropics, the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees. The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature, which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds: the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it’s swung around in the air (since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air, this single number reflects both heat and humidity). At present, most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees. What is called heat stress comes much sooner.

Actually, we’re about there already. Since 1980, the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat; a bigger increase is to come. The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002, and soon, the IPCC warns, simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe. Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable, annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015. At four degrees, the deadly European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day, will be a normal summer. At six, according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the world today. As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change: What Everyone Needs to Know, heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain, one of the planet’s hottest spots, and the temperature in Bahrain “would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans.” The high-end IPCC estimate, remember, is two degrees warmer still. By the end of the century, the World Bank has estimated, the coolest months in tropical South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century. Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem; plus, the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside, it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world, many of them also the poorest. And indeed, the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf, where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit. As soon as several decades from now, the hajj will become physically impossible for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year.

It is not just the hajj, and it is not just Mecca; heat is already killing us. In the sugarcane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease, including over a quarter of the men, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago. With dialysis, which is expensive, those with kidney failure can expect to live five years; without it, life expectancy is in the weeks. Of course, heat stress promises to pummel us in places other than our kidneys, too. As I type that sentence, in the California desert in mid-June, it is 121 degrees outside my door. It is not a record high.

III. The End of Food
Praying for cornfields in the tundra.

Climates differ and plants vary, but the basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent. Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent. Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them. And proteins are worse: It takes 16 calories of grain to produce just a single calorie of hamburger meat, butchered from a cow that spent its life polluting the climate with methane farts.

Pollyannaish plant physiologists will point out that the cereal-crop math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature, and they are right — theoretically, a warmer climate will make it easier to grow corn in Greenland. But as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown, the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity. And you can’t easily move croplands north a few hundred miles, because yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the quality of soil there; it takes many centuries for the planet to produce optimally fertile dirt.

Drought might be an even bigger problem than heat, with some of the world’s most arable land turning quickly to desert. Precipitation is notoriously hard to model, yet predictions for later this century are basically unanimous: unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced. By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever was. The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China. None of these places, which today supply much of the world’s food, will be reliable sources of any. As for the original dust bowl: The droughts in the American plains and Southwest would not just be worse than in the 1930s, a 2015 NASA study predicted, but worse than any droughts in a thousand years — and that includes those that struck between 1100 and 1300, which “dried up all the rivers East of the Sierra Nevada mountains” and may have been responsible for the death of the Anasazi civilization.

Remember, we do not live in a world without hunger as it is. Far from it: Most estimates put the number of undernourished at 800 million globally. In case you haven’t heard, this spring has already brought an unprecedented quadruple famine to Africa and the Middle East; the U.N. has warned that separate starvation events in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Yemen could kill 20 million this year alone.

IV. Climate Plagues
What happens when the bubonic ice melts?

Rock, in the right spot, is a record of planetary history, eras as long as millions of years flattened by the forces of geological time into strata with amplitudes of just inches, or just an inch, or even less. Ice works that way, too, as a climate ledger, but it is also frozen history, some of which can be reanimated when unfrozen. There are now, trapped in Arctic ice, diseases that have not circulated in the air for millions of years — in some cases, since before humans were around to encounter them. Which means our immune systems would have no idea how to fight back when those prehistoric plagues emerge from the ice.

The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times. In Alaska, already, researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million — about 5 percent of the world’s population and almost six times as many as had died in the world war for which the pandemic served as a kind of gruesome capstone. As the BBC reported in May, scientists suspect smallpox and the bubonic plague are trapped in Siberian ice, too — an abridged history of devastating human sickness, left out like egg salad in the Arctic sun.

Experts caution that many of these organisms won’t actually survive the thaw and point to the fastidious lab conditions under which they have already reanimated several of them — the 32,000-year-old “extremophile” bacteria revived in 2005, an 8 million-year-old bug brought back to life in 2007, the 3.5 million–year–old one a Russian scientist self-injected just out of curiosity — to suggest that those are necessary conditions for the return of such ancient plagues. But already last year, a boy was killed and 20 others infected by anthrax released when retreating permafrost exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by the bacteria at least 75 years earlier; 2,000 present-day reindeer were infected, too, carrying and spreading the disease beyond the tundra.

What concerns epidemiologists more than ancient diseases are existing scourges relocated, rewired, or even re-evolved by warming. The first effect is geographical. Before the early-modern period, when adventuring sailboats accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs, human provinciality was a guard against pandemic. Today, even with globalization and the enormous intermingling of human populations, our ecosystems are mostly stable, and this functions as another limit, but global warming will scramble those ecosystems and help disease trespass those limits as surely as Cortés did. You don’t worry much about dengue or malaria if you are living in Maine or France. But as the tropics creep northward and mosquitoes migrate with them, you will. You didn’t much worry about Zika a couple of years ago, either.

As it happens, Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation. One reason you hadn’t heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda; another is that it did not, until recently, appear to cause birth defects. Scientists still don’t entirely understand what happened, or what they missed. But there are things we do know for sure about how climate affects some diseases: Malaria, for instance, thrives in hotter regions not just because the mosquitoes that carry it do, too, but because for every degree increase in temperature, the parasite reproduces ten times faster. Which is one reason that the World Bank estimates that by 2050, 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with it.

V. Unbreathable Air
A rolling death smog that suffocates millions.

Our lungs need oxygen, but that is only a fraction of what we breathe. The fraction of carbon dioxide is growing: It just crossed 400 parts per million, and high-end estimates extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100. At that concentration, compared to the air we breathe now, human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent.

Other stuff in the hotter air is even scarier, with small increases in pollution capable of shortening life spans by ten years. The warmer the planet gets, the more ozone forms, and by mid-century, Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase in unhealthy ozone smog, the National Center for Atmospheric Research has projected. By 2090, as many as 2 billion people globally will be breathing air above the WHO “safe” level; one paper last month showed that, among other effects, a pregnant mother’s exposure to ozone raises the child’s risk of autism (as much as tenfold, combined with other environmental factors). Which does make you think again about the autism epidemic in West Hollywood.

Already, more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning; each year, 339,000 people die from wildfire smoke, in part because climate change has extended forest-fire season (in the U.S., it’s increased by 78 days since 1970). By 2050, according to the U.S. Forest Service, wildfires will be twice as destructive as they are today; in some places, the area burned could grow fivefold. What worries people even more is the effect that would have on emissions, especially when the fires ravage forests arising out of peat. Peatland fires in Indonesia in 1997, for instance, added to the global CO2 release by up to 40 percent, and more burning only means more warming only means more burning. There is also the terrifying possibility that rain forests like the Amazon, which in 2010 suffered its second “hundred-year drought” in the space of five years, could dry out enough to become vulnerable to these kinds of devastating, rolling forest fires — which would not only expel enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere but also shrink the size of the forest. That is especially bad because the Amazon alone provides 20 percent of our oxygen.

Then there are the more familiar forms of pollution. In 2013, melting Arctic ice remodeled Asian weather patterns, depriving industrial China of the natural ventilation systems it had come to depend on, which blanketed much of the country’s north in an unbreathable smog. Literally unbreathable. A metric called the Air Quality Index categorizes the risks and tops out at the 301-to-500 range, warning of “serious aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly” and, for all others, “serious risk of respiratory effects”; at that level, “everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion.” The Chinese “airpocalypse” of 2013 peaked at what would have been an Air Quality Index of over 800. That year, smog was responsible for a third of all deaths in the country.

VI. Perpetual War
The violence baked into heat.

Climatologists are very careful when talking about Syria. They want you to know that while climate change did produce a drought that contributed to civil war, it is not exactly fair to saythat the conflict is the result of warming; next door, for instance, Lebanon suffered the same crop failures. But researchers like Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang have managed to quantify some of the non-obvious relationships between temperature and violence: For every half-degree of warming, they say, societies will see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict. In climate science, nothing is simple, but the arithmetic is harrowing: A planet five degrees warmer would have at least half again as many wars as we do today. Overall, social conflict could more than double this century.

This is one reason that, as nearly every climate scientist I spoke to pointed out, the U.S. military is obsessed with climate change: The drowning of all American Navy bases by sea-level rise is trouble enough, but being the world’s policeman is quite a bit harder when the crime rate doubles. Of course, it’s not just Syria where climate has contributed to conflict. Some speculate that the elevated level of strife across the Middle East over the past generation reflects the pressures of global warming — a hypothesis all the more cruel considering that warming began accelerating when the industrialized world extracted and then burned the region’s oil.

What accounts for the relationship between climate and conflict? Some of it comes down to agriculture and economics; a lot has to do with forced migration, already at a record high, with at least 65 million displaced people wandering the planet right now. But there is also the simple fact of individual irritability. Heat increases municipal crime rates, and swearing on social media, and the likelihood that a major-league pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch, will hit an opposing batter in retaliation. And the arrival of air-conditioning in the developed world, in the middle of the past century, did little to solve the problem of the summer crime wave.

VII. Permanent Economic Collapse
Dismal capitalism in a half-poorer world.

The murmuring mantra of global neoliberalism, which prevailed between the end of the Cold War and the onset of the Great Recession, is that economic growth would save us from anything and everything.
But in the aftermath of the 2008 crash, a growing number of historians studying what they call “fossil capitalism” have begun to suggest that the entire history of swift economic growth, which began somewhat suddenly in the 18th century, is not the result of innovation or trade or the dynamics of global capitalism but simply our discovery of fossil fuels and all their raw power — a onetime injection of new “value” into a system that had previously been characterized by global subsistence living. Before fossil fuels, nobody lived better than their parents or grandparents or ancestors from 500 years before, except in the immediate aftermath of a great plague like the Black Death, which allowed the lucky survivors to gobble up the resources liberated by mass graves. After we’ve burned all the fossil fuels, these scholars suggest, perhaps we will return to a “steady state” global economy. Of course, that onetime injection has a devastating long-term cost: climate change.

The most exciting research on the economics of warming has also come from Hsiang and his colleagues, who are not historians of fossil capitalism but who offer some very bleak analysis of their own: Every degree Celsius of warming costs, on average, 1.2 percent of GDP (an enormous number, considering we count growth in the low single digits as “strong”). This is the sterling work in the field, and their median projection is for a 23 percent loss in per capita earning globally by the end of this century (resulting from changes in agriculture, crime, storms, energy, mortality, and labor).
Tracing the shape of the probability curve is even scarier: There is a 12 percent chance that climate change will reduce global output by more than 50 percent by 2100, they say, and a 51 percent chance that it lowers per capita GDP by 20 percent or more by then, unless emissions decline. By comparison, the Great Recession lowered global GDP by about 6 percent, in a onetime shock; Hsiang and his colleagues estimate a one-in-eight chance of an ongoing and irreversible effect by the end of the century that is eight times worse.

The scale of that economic devastation is hard to comprehend, but you can start by imagining what the world would look like today with an economy half as big, which would produce only half as much value, generating only half as much to offer the workers of the world. It makes the grounding of flights out of heat-stricken Phoenix last month seem like pathetically small economic potatoes. And, among other things, it makes the idea of postponing government action on reducing emissions and relying solely on growth and technology to solve the problem an absurd business calculation.
Every round-trip ticket on flights from New York to London, keep in mind, costs the Arctic three more square meters of ice.

VIII. Poisoned Oceans
Sulfide burps off the skeleton coast.

That the sea will become a killer is a given. Barring a radical reduction of emissions, we will see at least four feet of sea-level rise and possibly ten by the end of the century. A third of the world’s major cities are on the coast, not to mention its power plants, ports, navy bases, farmlands, fisheries, river deltas, marshlands, and rice-paddy empires, and even those above ten feet will flood much more easily, and much more regularly, if the water gets that high. At least 600 million people live within ten meters of sea level today.

But the drowning of those homelands is just the start. At present, more than a third of the world’s carbon is sucked up by the oceans — thank God, or else we’d have that much more warming already. But the result is what’s called “ocean acidification,” which, on its own, may add a half a degree to warming this century. It is also already burning through the planet’s water basins — you may remember these as the place where life arose in the first place. You have probably heard of “coral bleaching” — that is, coral dying — which is very bad news, because reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and supply food for half a billion people. Ocean acidification will fry fish populations directly, too, though scientists aren’t yet sure how to predict the effects on the stuff we haul out of the ocean to eat; they do know that in acid waters, oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells, and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans’ pH has over the past generation, it induces seizures, comas, and sudden death.

That isn’t all that ocean acidification can do. Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “anoxic,” first in deep ocean “dead zones,” then gradually up toward the surface. There, the small fish die out, unable to breathe, which means oxygen-eating bacteria thrive, and the feedback loop doubles back. This process, in which dead zones grow like cancers, choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries, is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia, where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the “Skeleton Coast.” The name originally referred to the detritus of the whaling industry, but today it’s more apt than ever. Hydrogen sulfide is so toxic that evolution has trained us to recognize the tiniest, safest traces of it, which is why our noses are so exquisitely skilled at registering flatulence. Hydrogen sulfide is also the thing that finally did us in that time 97 percent of all life on Earth died, once all the feedback loops had been triggered and the circulating jet streams of a warmed ocean ground to a halt — it’s the planet’s preferred gas for a natural holocaust. Gradually, the ocean’s dead zones spread, killing off marine species that had dominated the oceans for hundreds of millions of years, and the gas the inert waters gave off into the atmosphere poisoned everything on land. Plants, too. It was millions of years before the oceans recovered.

IX. The Great Filter
Our present eeriness cannot last.

So why can’t we see it? In his recent book-length essay The Great Derangement, the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh wonders why global warming and natural disaster haven’t become major subjects of contemporary fiction — why we don’t seem able to imagine climate catastrophe, and why we haven’t yet had a spate of novels in the genre he basically imagines into half-existence and names “the environmental uncanny.” “Consider, for example, the stories that congeal around questions like, ‘Where were you when the Berlin Wall fell?’ or ‘Where were you on 9/11?’ ” he writes. “Will it ever be possible to ask, in the same vein, ‘Where were you at 400 ppm?’ or ‘Where were you when the Larsen B ice shelf broke up?’ ” His answer: Probably not, because the dilemmas and dramas of climate change are simply incompatible with the kinds of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, especially in novels, which tend to emphasize the journey of an individual conscience rather than the poisonous miasma of social fate.

Surely this blindness will not last — the world we are about to inhabit will not permit it. In a six-degree-warmer world, the Earth’s ecosystem will boil with so many natural disasters that we will just start calling them “weather”: a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts, the planet assaulted regularly with climate events that not so long ago destroyed whole civilizations. The strongest hurricanes will come more often, and we’ll have to invent new categories with which to describe them; tornadoes will grow longer and wider and strike much more frequently, and hail rocks will quadruple in size. Humans used to watch the weather to prophesy the future; going forward, we will see in its wrath the vengeance of the past. Early naturalists talked often about “deep time” — the perception they had, contemplating the grandeur of this valley or that rock basin, of the profound slowness of nature. What lies in store for us is more like what the Victorian anthropologists identified as “dreamtime,” or “everywhen”: the semi-mythical experience, described by Aboriginal Australians, of encountering, in the present moment, an out-of-time past, when ancestors, heroes, and demigods crowded an epic stage. You can find it already watching footage of an iceberg collapsing into the sea — a feeling of history happening all at once.

It is. Many people perceive climate change as a sort of moral and economic debt, accumulated since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and now come due after several centuries — a helpful perspective, in a way, since it is the carbon-burning processes that began in 18th-century England that lit the fuse of everything that followed. But more than half of the carbon humanity has exhaled into the atmosphere in its entire history has been emitted in just the past three decades; since the end of World War II, the figure is 85 percent. Which means that, in the length of a single generation, global warming has brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe, and that the story of the industrial world’s kamikaze mission is also the story of a single lifetime. My father’s, for instance: born in 1938, among his first memories the news of Pearl Harbor and the mythic Air Force of the propaganda films that followed, films that doubled as advertisements for imperial-American industrial might; and among his last memories the coverage of the desperate signing of the Paris climate accords on cable news, ten weeks before he died of lung cancer last July. Or my mother’s: born in 1945, to German Jews fleeing the smokestacks through which their relatives were incinerated, now enjoying her 72nd year in an American commodity paradise, a paradise supported by the supply chains of an industrialized developing world. She has been smoking for 57 of those years, unfiltered.

Or the scientists’. Some of the men who first identified a changing climate (and given the generation, those who became famous were men) are still alive; a few are even still working. Wally Broecker is 84 years old and drives to work at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory across the Hudson every day from the Upper West Side. Like most of those who first raised the alarm, he believes that no amount of emissions reduction alone can meaningfully help avoid disaster. Instead, he puts his faith in carbon capture — untested technology to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which Broecker estimates will cost at least several trillion dollars — and various forms of “geoengineering,” the catchall name for a variety of moon-shot technologies far-fetched enough that many climate scientists prefer to regard them as dreams, or nightmares, from science fiction. He is especially focused on what’s called the aerosol approach — dispersing so much sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere that when it converts to sulfuric acid, it will cloud a fifth of the horizon and reflect back 2 percent of the sun’s rays, buying the planet at least a little wiggle room, heat-wise. “Of course, that would make our sunsets very red, would bleach the sky, would make more acid rain,” he says. “But you have to look at the magnitude of the problem. You got to watch that you don’t say the giant problem shouldn’t be solved because the solution causes some smaller problems.” He won’t be around to see that, he told me. “But in your lifetime …”

Jim Hansen is another member of this godfather generation. Born in 1941, he became a climatologist at the University of Iowa, developed the groundbreaking “Zero Model” for projecting climate change, and later became the head of climate research at NASA, only to leave under pressure when, while still a federal employee, he filed a lawsuit against the federal government charging inaction on warming (along the way he got arrested a few times for protesting, too). The lawsuit, which is brought by a collective called Our Children’s Trust and is often described as “kids versus climate change,” is built on an appeal to the equal-protection clause, namely, that in failing to take action on warming, the government is violating it by imposing massive costs on future generations; it is scheduled to be heard this winter in Oregon district court. Hansen has recently given up on solving the climate problem with a carbon tax alone, which had been his preferred approach, and has set about calculating the total cost of the additional measure of extracting carbon from the atmosphere.

Hansen began his career studying Venus, which was once a very Earth-like planet with plenty of life-supporting water before runaway climate change rapidly transformed it into an arid and uninhabitable sphere enveloped in an unbreathable gas; he switched to studying our planet by 30, wondering why he should be squinting across the solar system to explore rapid environmental change when he could see it all around him on the planet he was standing on. “When we wrote our first paper on this, in 1981,” he told me, “I remember saying to one of my co-authors, ‘This is going to be very interesting. Sometime during our careers, we’re going to see these things beginning to happen.’ ”

Several of the scientists I spoke with proposed global warming as the solution to Fermi’s famous paradox, which asks, If the universe is so big, then why haven’t we encountered any other intelligent life in it? The answer, they suggested, is that the natural life span of a civilization may be only several thousand years, and the life span of an industrial civilization perhaps only several hundred. In a universe that is many billions of years old, with star systems separated as much by time as by space, civilizations might emerge and develop and burn themselves up simply too fast to ever find one another. Peter Ward, a charismatic paleontologist among those responsible for discovering that the planet’s mass extinctions were caused by greenhouse gas, calls this the “Great Filter”: “Civilizations rise, but there’s an environmental filter that causes them to die off again and disappear fairly quickly,” he told me. “If you look at planet Earth, the filtering we’ve had in the past has been in these mass extinctions.” The mass extinction we are now living through has only just begun; so much more dying is coming.

And yet, improbably, Ward is an optimist. So are Broecker and Hansen and many of the other scientists I spoke to. We have not developed much of a religion of meaning around climate change that might comfort us, or give us purpose, in the face of possible annihilation. But climate scientists have a strange kind of faith: We will find a way to forestall radical warming, they say, because we must.

It is not easy to know how much to be reassured by that bleak certainty, and how much to wonder whether it is another form of delusion; for global warming to work as parable, of course, someone needs to survive to tell the story. The scientists know that to even meet the Paris goals, by 2050, carbon emissions from energy and industry, which are still rising, will have to fall by half each decade; emissions from land use (deforestation, cow farts, etc.) will have to zero out; and we will need to have invented technologies to extract, annually, twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet’s plants now do. Nevertheless, by and large, the scientists have an enormous confidence in the ingenuity of humans — a confidence perhaps bolstered by their appreciation for climate change, which is, after all, a human invention, too. They point to the Apollo project, the hole in the ozone we patched in the 1980s, the passing of the fear of mutually assured destruction. Now we’ve found a way to engineer our own doomsday, and surely we will find a way to engineer our way out of it, one way or another. The planet is not used to being provoked like this, and climate systems designed to give feedback over centuries or millennia prevent us — even those who may be watching closely — from fully imagining the damage done already to the planet. But when we do truly see the world we’ve made, they say, we will also find a way to make it livable. For them, the alternative is simply unimaginable.

Much of the article explores “worst case” scenarios of change in the climate system and the resulting impacts on human populations.

Scientists reviewed the article to determine whether the descriptions of those scenarios accurately reflect the state of scientific knowledge. The New York Magazine article has triggered a number of responses debating the merits of the decision to focus on worst case scenarios, but our review simply addresses the scientific accuracy of the article.

The reviewers found that some statements in this complex article do misrepresent research on the topic, and some others lack the necessary context to be clearly understood by the reader. Many other explanations in the article are correct, but readers are likely left with an overall conclusion that is exaggerated compared to our best scientific understanding.

","The article paints an overly bleak picture by overstating some of the science. It exaggerates for example, the near-term threat of climate “feedbacks” involving the release of frozen methane (the science on this is much more nuanced and doesn’t support the notion of a game-changing, planet-melting methane bomb. It is unclear that much of this frozen methane can be readily mobilized by projected warming).

Also, I was struck by erroneous statements like this one referencing “satellite data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice as fast as scientists had thought.”

That’s just not true. The study in question simply showed that one particular satellite temperature dataset that had tended to show *less* warming that the other datasets, has now been brought in line with the other temperature data after some problems with that dataset were dealt with.

Ironically, I am a co-author of a recent article in the journal Nature Geoscience (see e.g. this piece), using that very same new, corrected, satellite dataset, that shows that past climate model simulations slightly **over-predicted** the actual warming during the first decade of the 21st century, likely because of a mis-specification of natural factors like solar variations and volcanic eruptions. Once these are accounted for, the models and observations are pretty much in line—the warming of the globe is pretty much progressing AS models predicted… which is bad enough.

The evidence that climate change is a serious problem that we must contend with now, is overwhelming on its own. There is no need to overstate the evidence, particularly when it feeds a paralyzing narrative of doom and hopelessness.

","While it is clear that ongoing warming of the global climate would eventually have very severe consequences, the concept of the Earth becoming uninhabitable within anywhere near the timescales suggested in the article is pure hyperbole.

","This article focuses on the high-end scenario for global warming—high emissions and/or high climate sensitivity, high impacts. It selects recent research that highlights these outcomes. I am sympathetic to the author’s efforts to raise awareness about such scenarios, including impacts that are not always well discussed, and agree that we tend to focus too much on median outcomes. Nevertheless, I think the article would have gained from a more explicit acknowledgement that this particular focus is the goal of the article, as well as a from an explicit discussion (even if only qualitative) of the probabilities associated with these scenarios. Absent that, I am afraid the article, as such, feels misleading, or at least confusing for the general public.

In addition, the article contains a number of claims that are factually wrong, and a number of claims that are, to my knowledge, not substantiated by research.

I was also concerned by the implied claim that this article, being written after interviews with many climate scientists, somehow reflects scientists’ true opinion about global warming. I don’t believe it does.

What this article suggest to me is that we, as as community of scientists and science journalists, need to find a better way to more accurately discuss climate change projections and to convey the associated risks to the public.

","Peter Neff, Assistant Research Professor, University of Minnesota
","In what seems an ode to new journalism, the author takes significant literary license to leverage information grounded in truth and paint an apocalyptic picture of extreme future scenarios possibly driven by anthropogenic climate change. Ambiguous references to studies, events and examples severely impairs credibility, as does a complete disregard for nuance.

","Christopher Colose, Research Scientist, SciSpace LLC, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
","There are many arguments in this article at the interface of climate instability, socio-political disruption, and general global security. They are, however, clumsily wrapped together and doesn’t reflect well the actual risk posed by climate change.

A general comment concerning the climate response to future carbon emissions—one of the emergent insights from decades of research is that linearity is too powerful of a tool to be abandoned lightly. In this context, it is better to think of future warming as smoothly monotonic in our total carbon emissions rather than behaving erratically due to significant non-linearities in the system.

There is no evidence that a very abrupt methane source(s) will be readily mobilized into the atmosphere. Such scenarios are not supported by process studies, it is not emerging observationally, and is not borne out paleoclimatically (particularly in the mid-Holocene or Eemian interglacial, where high latitude summers were hotter than today). A small trickle of CH4 release is very plausible, but methane becomes converted to CO2 pretty quickly in Earth’s atmosphere, and there’s already some 200 times more CO2 in the air than CH4. These types of carbon cycle feedbacks will likely give the direct anthropogenic carbon input just a small boost in the near future.

Similarly, it’s not obvious that there are any significantly missing feedbacks that should radically alter the linear perspective (certainly, any under-representation of surface albedo feedbacks in current models are unlikely to be the difference maker, since the polar regions make up a very small percentage of the globe and the surface contribution to the planetary albedo is somewhat masked by clouds).

A Younger Dryas event today would likely be quite disruptive (the global mean temperature changes were quite modest, but the extratropical temperature re-organizations would still be significant); however, the processes leading to an event like this are pretty unique to a glacial climate undergoing melting, and is unlikely to occur in a warming world during our present interglacial.

Actual numbers are important here. The global temperature increase could indeed reach 4-5 degrees by 2100, if humans don’t do anything to our emissions, and beyond this patches of uninhabitable areas (for humans) could start to open up in the tropics, due to heat stress limits imposed by the evaporative limits of our body. Indeed, a world 5+ degrees warmer is a big cause for alarm, even if the world takes a linear path to that mark. The world also does not end in 2100, and while it is tempting to think of later dates as “very far off,” it is worth reminding ourselves that we would live on a different planet had people of the Viking era industrialized and emitted carbon uncontrollably.

Nonetheless, the near future climatic fate of New York probably looks more like the climate of South Carolina or Georgia than something from a Mad Max movie. This is still an important basis for concern given that the socio-political infrastructure that exists around the world is biased toward the modern climate.

Many of the nightmare scenarios in this article, such as no more food, unbreathable air, poisoned oceans, perpetual warfare, etc. are simply ridiculous, although food security is indeed an issue at stake (see David Battisti’s comments). A “business-as-usual” climate in 1-2 centuries still looks markedly different than the current one, but there’s no reason yet to think much of the world will become uninhabitable or look like a science fiction novel.

","Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany
","We are taking the climate system out of known territories. There will be many surprises and they are what worry me the most. Uncertainty is not our friend and that makes it very hard to say which worst case scenarios are unrealistic.

The bigger the stakes the smaller the acceptable risks. A risk someone may be willing to take personally will be larger than the risk one takes with a community, a country or civilization.

In that respect it is good that the article explores what surprises may be in store and talks about scenarios that are not likely, but a large part of the total risk.

However, unfortunately often statements are inaccurate, wrong or are missing important context. These inaccuracies tend to exaggerate the risks of climate change.

","I do not disagree with the tone of the article in the way that most folks here seem to, and I think it does a service to highlight recent results and ideas throughout the scientific community.

That’s not to downplay the very real and very large threat to human lives, economies, infrastructure, ecosystems, and species—and the author does a good job cataloging many of these later in the piece.

I don’t think it is accurate to say that Venus was “once a very Earth-like planet” and hence imply that the runaway greenhouse effect could happen here. For one thing, Venus is much closer to the sun. A runaway greenhouse effect on Earth is not thought to be a plausible threat.

","My expertise is not in exoplanetary climate, but it is not a definitively accepted “fact” that Venus was once habitable. There is still considerable debate regarding the past habitability of Venus (see links below). Therefore, this statement (which appears to imply that Venus’s climate trajectory is foreshadowing for Earth’s) comes off way too strong.

","I am not sure how one defines habitability. Paucity of resources (e.g., water, vegetation) does not necessarily make a region uninhabitable. So I think that strictly speaking, the author is referring here to studies showing that the combination of heat+humidity may exceed a threshold for human survival some part of the year in already-very-hot-an-humid parts of Southwest Asia (around the Gulf of Persia) by the end of the century1.

To my knowledge this kind of result hasn’t been shown for other regions, so in that context, the sentence “parts of”, while technically correct, may imply more than has been established.

Note, however, that even without exceeding survival limits, humid heat increases would have impacts on outdoor activities2.

",,,,"“there are alarming stories every day, like last month’s satellite data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice as fast as scientists had thought”

","This sentence is true for RSS data, but it’s somewhat misleading due to lack of context. If you look at the two most recent versions of the RSS data and compute linear trends Jan 1998-Dec 2016, you find that the new version has a trend value for this period of about 2.6 times larger than the previous version. But, it is good to remember that 1998 is a favorite starting point for those that seek to minimize the perceived threat of global warming. This preference is because 1998 is a relative maximum in global temperature (due to a large ENSO event), and thus trends that start in Jan 1998 are smaller than trends that start in other, nearby years. This means that when the change in trends between datasets is reported as a multiplicative effect, the change appears quite large. However, if one calculated the trends for Jan 1999-Dec 2016 instead, the trends increases by a factor of about 1.6, not 2.6, only a 60% increase. Of course this is still a pretty large increase.

The sentence also ignores the other sources of lower-tropospheric satellite data. The newer version of the UAH (Version 6.0) data shows less warming than the previous version. Also, the radiosonde datasets show more warming over this period that any of the satellite datasets (except maybe UAH V5.6), and have done so for years.

","If anything, satellite measurements of lower atmospheric temperatures (which is what the author is talking about here, not near-surface, 2-meter temperature), show slightly less warming than predicted by models, a discrepancy that is a topic of ongoing research*.

","I would like to add that this “twice as fast” is just for a cherry-picked period. That is about as bad as mitigation sceptics claiming that global warming has stopped by cherry picking a specific period.

The real message was that satellite upper air warming estimates are unreliable (still are), but seem to confirm what we know from the surface warming.

This story was thus not alarming. If anything is was good news, it reduces uncertainties and as this uninhabitable-article already suggests: uncertainty is not our friend.",,"“Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this, it may already have met the open water, where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a process known poetically as ‘calving.’”","Although a particularly dramatic and well-observed example of how floating ice shelves calve icebergs into the ocean, there is little evidence that the crack in the Larsen C ice shelf is directly related to climate change. At best this is subject to considerable debate, as it is difficult to directly connect particular atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms to the cracking of this single, albeit large, proto-iceberg.

For a very measured treatment of this topic, see the Guardian article by Professor Helen Fricker of Scripps Institute of Oceanography.

Having now just calved an iceberg as of July 12, it is good to hear from the most experience experts how concerning this event is. A really great simple summary is provided by David Vaughan, Director of Science for the British Antarctic Survey, who has worked on the Antarctic Peninsula and studied regional ice shelves for decades.

They point to the example of the Netherlands to show that low-lying countries can adapt and even reclaim land from the sea.  Of course this won’t be possible everywhere, especially in wilderness areas such as the Sundarbans which would be impacted by such measures themselves, but talk of the entire country “not surviving” is not a fair reflection of the scientific analysis.

","Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany:
Regions with open water will stay relatively warm due to the relatively warm water. As soon as ice limits heat flows from the ocean to the atmosphere it can get very cold. Also, in general variability is much stronger in the Arctic—what sounds like a really big warm anomaly to an innocent reader in the USA is thus exceptional, but less so than the numbers suggest. That is context a reader would need to know.

At six[…] summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the world today[…].”
","“At two degrees… at four… at six” What is missing here is a discussion of the probabilities of each target, depending on emission scenarios, etc… It’s fine to discuss high-end scenarios, but mentioning probabilities would add context—without deterring from discussing the extreme risks associated, I believe.

In general, the language in this paragraph is dire, but, in my opinion, this is an underappreciated consequence of global warming, and the author does well to highlight it.

It’s difficult to extrapolate future impacts from one-time events: the 2003 heatwave killed that many people in Europe because it was so far out from the usual distribution, and populations were poorly prepared. In a warmer future, preparedness and reactivity would arguably be improved, so impacts could be reduced.

","The article highlights worst case projections of the intensity of heatwaves, but not of their frequency. Projections indicate return periods of high-mortality heatwaves will shorten over the century and, in some cases, the length of these high-mortality heatwaves will increase.  That does not mean these events will occur every day during a summer. In many regions, this means a high-mortality heatwave could occur could approach becoming an annual event instead of rarely. Further, the projections do not take into account that increased heat-related hazards are only one factor that influences future risks. The other factors are the extent of exposure, the vulnerability of the exposed population, and the capacity of individuals and communities to prepare for and manage heatwaves. There is growing literature that sensitivity to heatwaves has declined over recent decades, presumably because of some degree of acclimatization to ever higher temperatures, increasing access to air conditioning and cooling centers, better understanding and communication of the risks of high ambient temperatures, and changing infrastructure to reduce urban heat islands.  Recent projections using different approaches that take these changes into account show that taking these factors into account decreases the magnitude of risks.",,,"“unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced”

","Actually, overall the general projection is for the world to be wetter on average, with increasing drought in some regions but decreases in others, and increased annual rainfall in many places. The projections are extremely uncertain though, so while it is probably possible to cherry-pick model simulations that suggest increased drought in almost any region (and hence argue, probably fairly, that most places do have some increased risk of drought) these would not be expected to happen concurrently everywhere. A scenario with increased drought in one region would generally see a decrease elsewhere.",,,,“a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts”,"Not to nitpick—we don’t really know what a +6 °C world would look like in detail—but the connection between tornadoes and warming is unclear, at least in the observable record.

","While there is still some uncertainty regarding the response of tropical cyclones (i.e. typhoons and hurricanes) to global warming, there is now evidence that frequency in many ocean basins may actually decrease, but maximum intensity will likely increase.

There is indeed evidence that the frequency and intensity of floods/droughts is increasing over much of the globe*, and will continue to do so as the climate warms. This is not necessarily true universally–there will still be quite a bit of spatial and temporal diversity in the response of precipitation extremes to global warming, even in a six-degree-warmer world. But in general, it’s true that there will be dramatically more flood and drought events on a global basis with multiple degrees of warming.

","Most work on studying the dynamics of greenhouse gas balance in degrading permafrost systems, both as based on field measurements and as represented in ecosystem models for making climate feedback projections, seems to point to methane release being a relatively minor pathway for permafrost carbon to be released to the atmosphere, at least for terrestrial permafrost sources (which comprise most of the carbon mentioned here). It is true that terrestrial permafrost systems emit methane, but most of that methane is from recently photosynthesized carbon rather than older permafrost sources, and most of the carbon released from the older permafrost sources is released as either carbon dioxide or dissolved organic carbon rather than methane. So, while uncertainty on this issue remains high, and permafrost thaw is a potentially strong feedback process, this feedback seems likely to be dominated by carbon dioxide rather than methane.

A specifically misleading thing about these numbers, which are a metric called “global warming potential”, is that their units are based on the mass of the gas. Since the question here is whether a given atom of carbon will be emitted to the atmosphere contained within either a molecule of carbon dioxide or a molecule of methane, you have to take into account the fact that the molecule of carbon dioxide is much heavier, because of the two oxygen atoms it picks up in the transformation to that gas, versus the four hydrogen atoms it would acquire in becoming methane. What this means in practice is that you have to divide the global warming potential by the ratio of the weight of the molecules, which is 44/16 or 2.75. So strictly speaking, the 34 and 86 ought to read 12 and 31. This is a separate issue from the timescale one that others point out, and which further makes this comparison misleading.
","It would be wrong to say, as I often read in the popular press, that all or most of the frozen permafrost carbon will come out as methane, or that Arctic methane will have much impact on climate evolution in the near future. But this article doesn’t exactly say that. Carbon released from permafrost that eventually reaches the atmosphere as CO2 could significantly add to the “long tail” climate impacts from CO2. And this is a much more certain outcome than from methane.

The factor of 86 however is totally misleading about the impact of methane vs. CO2. This is an instantaneous impact on radiative forcing (a high-end one at that), and doesn’t reflect the longevity of CO2 (long enough to melt ice sheets) vs. methane (which, emitted now, will mostly be CO2 by the time of peak temperature, say, optimistically, 2050).

","This is incorrect.

First, to the best of my knowledge, there currently is not a strong consensus about whether thawing permafrost areas would be a net carbon sink or source. If the only process is that the permafrost carbon is respired by microbes and released to the atmosphere, then there is indeed a large carbon source. However, permafrost areas currently are mostly tundra or tundra-boreal forest biomes, which have relatively low biomass carbon stores. With warming, there would be more forest expansion into formerly permafrost areas, which may compensate for the respiration of permafrost carbon.

Second, with regard to large-scale methane release from thawing permafrost, currently available science indicates that this is unlikely. First, despite the ongoing Arctic warming, there is no evidence (from precise atmospheric measurements of methane) that Arctic methane emissions are increasing. Second, an ice core study that I led a number of years ago* indicated that “old” carbon sources (carbon sources depleted in the radioactive carbon–14 isotope) did not play a large role in a rapid methane increase that was associated with a period of warming 11,600 years ago. Permafrost carbon is old and relatively low in carbon–14 content. That warming provides a partial analog to what is happening today. While we can’t with 100% certainty rule out the possibility of large methane emissions from thawing permafrost in the future, the scientific data available to date indicate that the probability of such emissions is low.

Petrenko et al (2009) 14CH4 Measurements in Greenland Ice: Investigating Last Glacial Termination CH4 Sources, Science
","The author’s facts about methane are generally accurate, but he amps up concern about catastrophic release of methane from permafrost beyond what evidence supports. Scientists also investigate whether methane frozen at the seafloor of some continental shelves can be catastrophically be released to the atmosphere.

However, existing evidence suggests that natural processes prevent catastrophe. Marine methane (gas hydrates) are heavily processed in the water column, and no contribution to the atmosphere has yet been observed. See an excellent review by Carolyn Ruppel of the US Geological Survey and John Kessler of the University of Rochester*, which was also summarized in the popular press.

Ruppel and Kessler (2017) The interaction of climate change and methane hydrates, Reviews of Geophysics
","“The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere). Each of these promises to accelerate warming”

","This statement is a mixture of true and false claims.

Physical feedbacks like albedo and cloud cover are most definitely included in Earth system models (ESMs) that are used to make future climate projections, so while the phrase “fully account for” isn’t well defined, the statement as written seems incorrect.

As of the 5th IPCC report, biogeochemical feedbacks from permafrost were not explicitly taken into account in fully-coupled ESM simulations. However, some simulations to quantify permafrost CO2 and CH4 feedbacks had been done as of that time and reported in the assessment text, and since then these types of studies have been expanded. The central estimate of the additional contribution of warming from these permafrost feedback processes is on the order of about 20 Pg C released per degree celsius global mean temperature change—or in physical terms about 0.1 watts per meter squared per degree Celsius—which is an important contribution to warming but likely less catastrophic than presented here. However, the uncertainty on these projections does remain high and I don’t think we can completely exclude the possibility of more serious permafrost-driven feedbacks yet.

Feedbacks arising from forest dieback is something that is included in some but not all ESMs used to make climate projections (i.e., those that have a “dynamic vegetation” component as opposed to a static, prescribed biogeography). Most carbon cycle models used in ESMs for climate assessments have extremely simplified treatment of forest mortality processes but, some do try to resolve this process, so while the uncertainty due to this process is extremely high and poorly captured in current ESM-based projections, it is not correct to say that it is not accounted for at all.

Also, the text implies that all feedback processes are positive, destabilizing feedbacks, which isn’t the case. There are also numerous negative, stabilizing feedbacks, that exist in the planet and that are also captured to various degrees in our models of the planet. As with the positive feedbacks, the uncertainty on these is large and most likely it is poorly captured by the current generation of ESMs.

","“More cloud cover (which traps heat)” is a gross over-simplification regarding the role of clouds as a tuning knob for Earth’s climate. While it is true that clouds can act as a blanket and trap more heat, they also serve to reflect sunlight (see the prior sentence regarding the albedo effect).

Which cloud effect ultimately wins out has to do with the optical thickness of the cloud (how reflective it is) and (as a rough approximation), the cloud height. As a quick rule: Higher clouds will act better as a blanket since they are both colder (and therefore radiate less energy to space) and typically optically thin. Conversely, lower clouds act more as a reflector since they are warmer and optically thick.

The IPCC report does generally show a net positive cloud feedback, indicating global cloud feedbacks will lead to additional warming, but cloud feedbacks are extremely complicated and highly uncertain.

","I am not sure what the author means here. The climate models whose projections the IPCC reports are based on definitely account for the changes in albedo from reduced sea-ice and snow cover as the world warms (although not necessarily changes in glaciers and ice caps extents—e.g. Greenland—which is maybe what the author means here), as well as the effect of changes in clouds (actually, the largest source of uncertainty in climate models projections); most models also now account for changes in vegetation and include an interactive carbon cycle (for instance, how a reduction in forest diminishes the land carbon sink).",,"“In fact, all but the one [extinction event] that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas. The most notorious was 252 million years ago; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead.”","Other agents of destruction have been invoked for the end Permian extinction, involving toxic fluorine fumes from volcanic emissions or sulfides from the deep sea.

","Climate change accompanies all of the mass extinctions, although severe warming isn’t necessarily always to blame. For example, the extinction at the end of the Ordovician occurred during a brief, enigmatic glaciation.

The “notorious” extinction 242 million years ago, at the end of the Permian, clearly (based on oxygen isotope proxy data) was accompanied by significant global warming likely triggered by the eruption of the “Siberian Traps” volcanoes, with concomitant buildup of carbon dioxide. Whether methane was released remains speculative, although not unlikely. The species extinction percentage in the ocean could have approached 97%, the proportion was likely lower on land.",,,"“the geological record shows that temperature can shift as much as ten degrees or more in a single decade”

","I am not sure, again, what the author is referring to here. Ice cores have shown that Greenland temperatures can swing by as much as 10 °C during glacial-interglacial transition*, yes, but we are not talking about global mean temperature here, more about swift reorganization of atmospheric circulation in interglacial glacial transitions that leads to strong regional change in the Arctic. I am unaware of studies showing past global-scale warming of 10 °C in a decade.

Note, however, that even global warming of a few degrees C in a century or two would be extremely fast, by geological standards.

",,,,"“The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.”

","I don’t know what time period the author is referring to here, but closer to us, during the last interglacial (roughly 120,000 years ago), Earth was ~2 °C warmer than temperatures in the 19th century, and sea levels were about 5-6 meters higher. This suggests that even “good-case, 2 °C” long-term warming in our future could also raise oceans by that much eventually, even if the pace of that rise (and thus the amount of rise by 2100) is uncertain.",,,,"“Things almost certainly won’t get that hot this century, though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually.”

","This brings up an important point: while historically, IPCC-type projections stop in 2100 by convention, warming does not stop then, in particular for very high (perhaps implausibly high) greenhouse gas emission scenarios: warming goes on in the following centuries, up to ten of degrees in the worst case.

Note that the larger the warming, the larger the uncertainties between climate models (the shading).",,,,“The end of food”,"This is hyperbole. Yes there are threats to crop production and other aspects of food security, but the scientific analyses do not suggest an actual “end of food”—it is more a case of regional winners and losers. Not all current food-producing regions are projected to lose their productivity. A redistribution of production would still still be a major issue that society will need to deal with, and may well require growing crops in new places, but this is not the same as suggesting that food supplies will completely come to an end.

",,,,"“the basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent. Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent. Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them.”

","These numbers stem from the results of controlled field sites (in, for example, the Philippines, India and Mexico) and refer to the impact of local temperature changes on yield, all else being equal. (Also, note that the major grain producing regions are in the midlatitudes, where the projected temperature increases are substantially greater than the projected global average temperature increase.)

The projected changes in precipitation are sufficiently uncertain that it is not possible to quantitatively account for the impact of their changes, although the IPCC 2013 WG1 Report concludes: “In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely increase under the RCP8.5 scenario.” (In IPCC lingo, “likely” is greater than 2/3 chance.)

Finally, there is also a fertilization effect associated with increasing CO2, although studies have shown that the deleterious impact of increasing temperature far outweigh the impact of increased CO2.

","Well, for one thing, if food supplies decrease by 50%, one could argue that it is unlikely population would increase by 50% in the meantime… More to the point, the back-of-the-envelope calculation from the author, here, implies that all crops are grown at optimal temperature, which they are not.

Exact, global impacts of global warming on agriculture are difficult to quantify. One must also account for the effect of increased atmospheric CO2 on plant photosynthesis, as well as precipitation changes, which are uncertain in particular over land in the Tropics. Adaptation and management could also influence changes a lot. Generally, the estimate has been that warming would be neutral for mid-and high latitudes, up to a point, while being detrimental to agriculture in low latitudes. But again, global, quantitative impacts are uncertain, especially for large warming. I haven’t seen studies suggesting a global decrease by 50%.",,,"“as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown, the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity.”","This statement is mostly accurate. To be more precise, it would read “Temperature in the tropics is already greater than the optimal temperature for growing the major crops (rice, wheat, maize). Most of the major grain-producing regions of the world are in the midlatitudes (e.g. the US, Europe, Ukraine, China), where today growing season temperatures are nearly optimal. Hence, warming due to increased CO2 will indeed decrease the yield of these crops in these high-producing regions.”",,,,“with some of the world’s most arable land turning quickly to desert”,"What regions? Is this a statement about the present, or the future?

If about the present, I am unaware of major arable land regions currently facing desertification.

Current drought trends—whether droughts, on the global scale, are increasing in extent and/or severity—and their future under global warming, is still somewhat uncertain and a topic of ongoing research.

",,,,"“Precipitation is notoriously hard to model, yet predictions for later this century are basically unanimous: unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced. By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever was. The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China.”

","In general, there is large uncertainty in how precipitation will change due to increased greenhouse gases, including the Sahel in Africa, Australia, and many of important grain producing regions of the world (e.g., the US, Ukraine, China). Under high emission scenarios, models consistently project annual averaged drying in a few places by the end of the Century: e.g. southern Europe, northern Africa, and southern Africa. The IPCC 2013 WG1 Report concludes: “In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely increase under the RCP8.5 scenario.” (In IPCC lingo, “likely” is greater than 2/3 chance.)

","This is not true for precipitation. See the right panel on the plot below:


What the author is probably referring to is drought projections not based on precipitation alone, but rainfall+temperature, as shown for instance by the Palmer Drought Index.

However, there is a debate as to how best to interpret such projections in terms, for instance, of impacts on vegetation (and crop yields) or water resources*.

So I would argue things are more uncertain than the authors implies here.

Milly and Dunne (2016) Potential evapotranspiration and continental drying, Nature Climate Change
","I agree with Alexis Berg’s comment above. Projections regarding widespread occurrence of historically unprecedented drought are in most cases the product of very strong warming that overwhelms any changes (positive or negative) in precipitation in terms of net moisture. Obviously, temperature-driven droughts will still have large and adverse consequences for agriculture in many regions—so the broader point made here regarding large risks to food production is reasonable.",,"“None of these places, which today supply much of the world’s food, will be reliable sources of any.”

","Even with no change in the natural variability in growing season temperature, increasing summer averaged temperature will likely lead to increased volatility in grain production in the midlatitudes because of the nonlinear relationship between temperature and yield. See section 7.4 of the IPCC 2013 WG2 Report for a recent summary.

Africa and “Iraq, Syria and much of the Middle East” are not on the list of the world’s major grain producer regions.",,,,"“In the sugarcane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease, including over a quarter of the men, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago.”

","If this author already writes “presumed result”, I would love to see a reference to the scientific literature. It would be quite surprising if the 1-1.5 °C warming we have seen up now makes such a differences.

At that concentration, compared to the air we breathe now, human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent.”

","There is, indeed, some research showing impairments in cognitive function test scores in people exposed to CO2 concentrations in the 950-1,000 ppm range, and even significantly worse performance when CO2 gets to 1,500 and 2,500 ppm. But note that concentrations greater than ~1,000 ppm are, already today, often found in poorly ventilated rooms and buildings.

At even higher concentrations, documented metabolic and health effects start to appear—in fact, the safe limit for permanent, long-term exposure to higher concentration of CO2 does not appear to be well known. It seems like NASA and the Navy set that limit around 5,000 ppm for their crews in submarines and spacecrafts.

This is not true.

To quote Wally Broecker, who is cited later in the article: “Simply put, our atmosphere is endowed with such an enormous reserve of this gas that even if we were to burn all our fossil fuel reserves, all our trees, and all the organic matter stored in soils, we would use up only a few percent of the available O2. No matter how foolishly we treat our environmental heritage, we simply don’t have the capacity to put more than a small dent in our O2 supply. Furthermore, the Earth’s forests do not play a dominant role in maintaining O2 reserves, because they consume just as much of this gas as they produce. In the tropics, ants, termites, bacteria, and fungi eat nearly the entire photosynthetic O2 product. Only a tiny fraction of the organic matter they produce accumulates in swamps and soils or is carried down the rivers for burial on the sea floor.”",,,,"“The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times.

Certainly much more needs to be done, but the article implies national and International public health organizations and institutions will not take action when diseases emerge or re-emerge.

Zika has been moving around the world for the past few years, presumably associated with trade and travel. With limited surveillance of Zika and with limited numbers of cases, it isn’t possible to say whether the disease caused birth defects before the large outbreak last year; research is underway to determine that.",,,,"“That isn’t all that ocean acidification can do. Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “anoxic,” first in deep ocean “dead zones,” then gradually up toward the surface[…]This process, in which dead zones grow like cancers, choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries, is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia, where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the ‘Skeleton Coast.’”

","Ocean acidification per se doesn’t enhance anoxia: anoxia (loss of oxygen) results from warming (warm water holds less dissolved gas like oxygen), which would be the consequence of atmospheric CO2 buildup, as might more sluggish ocean mixing. It also is enhanced by increased nutrient delivery to the ocean from more rain and river flow on land under the warmer climate. More nutrients mean more algae growth in the uppermost ocean, more decaying organic matter below the surface, and thus less oxygen. Low oxygen zones would spread as the ocean became warmer and river flow increased as the event progressed. When oxygen is exhausted, bacteria do “breathe” other oxygen-containing compounds including sulfate and respire hydrogen sulfide. The coast of Namibia does experience these extreme conditions episodically, but such conditions are unlikely to spread globally until centuries to millennia of warming and eutrophication have occurred. Hydrogen sulfide likely contributed to the mass extinction, but the warming itself as well as other volcanic emanations like chlorine, fluorine, and sulfur dioxide were equally if not more important drivers of the extinction.

"Breitbart article falsely claims that measured global warming has been “fabricated”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-article-falsely-claims-measured-global-warming-fabricated-james-delingpole/,"Nearly All’ Recent Global Warming Is Fabricated, Study Finds",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/07/09/delingpole-nearly-all-recent-global-warming-is-fabricated-study-finds/,"Much of recent global warming has been fabricated by climate scientists to make it look more frightening, a study has found.

The peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets (GAST) which are used by climate alarmists to argue that recent years have been “the hottest evah” and that the warming of the last 120 years has been dramatic and unprecedented.

What they found is that these readings are “totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data.”

That is, the adjusted data used by alarmist organizations like NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office differs so markedly from the original raw data that it cannot be trusted.

This chart gives you a good idea of the direction of the adjustments.

The blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer.

Note how most of the downward adjustments take place in the early twentieth century and most of the upward take place in the late twentieth century.

According to meteorologist Joe D’Aleo, who co-authored the study with statistician James Wallace and Cato Institute climate scientist Craig Idso, this has the effect of exaggerating the warming trend:

“Nearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the adjustments.”

“Each dataset pushed down the 1940s warming and pushed up the current warming.”

“You would think that when you make adjustments you’d sometimes get warming and sometimes get cooling. That’s almost never happened.”

What this means, the report concludes, is that claims by NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office that the world is experiencing unprecedented and dramatic warming should be taken with a huge pinch of salt: they all use the same corrupted global average temperature (GAST) data.

The conclusive findings of this research are that the three GAST data sets are not a valid representation of reality. In fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data. Thus, it is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that recent years have been the warmest ever – despite current claims of record setting warming.",very_low,"Biased, Inaccurate, Misleading",1253,"This Breitbart article by James Delingpole claims that the observed warming of Earth’s surface temperatures is largely a fabrication by scientists who have altered the measurements. The source for this claim is a document written by three individuals who have no track record of publishing scientific research on the topic, and have not submitted their work to peer-reviewed scientific journals, but simply uploaded a pdf on a wordpress blog.

Scientists who reviewed the article found that its claims are false and misleading. Data are indeed adjusted to accurately account for things like changes in the instruments used to make measurements or the relocation of weather stations. However, the impact of these adjustments on the global temperature record is actually small, and the warming trend of the last century would appear to be larger without the adjustments, in contradiction with the claims in the Breitbart article.

","In general, their argument about removing cyclical behavior comes from comparing old 1980s NASA GISTemp records to those of today. What they don’t tell you is that the 1980 record in question (in addition to being graphed on a different baseline than all the other series) only comes from around 500 land stations almost entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and does not include any ocean data at all.

There is a well known warm period in the mid-to-high latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere in the 1930s and 1940s, but it does not really show up much in the oceans and not at all in the S Hemisphere. As scientists have collected more historical temperature records from around the world in the past 35 years, we have created more complete records that show less warmth in that period simply because they cover more of the planet. See the NASA website for a good discussion of this.

Ultimately all of these comparisons to past records are a bit of a distraction. We have all the raw temperature records today, and we can compare them to the adjusted data to see what, exactly, adjustments do to the temperature record. It turns out that adjustments actually result in less warming over the past century, not more. If we scientists were “cooking the books”, then we are doing so in the wrong direction.

",,,,"Peter Thorne, Professor, Maynooth University
","Firstly, as far as I can tell the report [the article is based on] is not published in the peer reviewed literature, yet that is the strong implication given. Then the central money figure is grossly misleading. It takes the difference between consecutive versions of the NOAA NCEI product and purports that these differences are the adjustments being applied to the raw data. I think the only phrase one could, with any validity, use here is “not even wrong”. Both the series have been adjusted, and to pretend otherwise is either showing willful ignorance or duplicity. Taking the difference solely shows the change in adjustments applied and not the total adjustments as is being implied. Indeed, the total common adjustments being applied to both versions of the NOAA NCEI product dwarf those being shown. And the biggest adjustment of all—and only one that really matters—is that applied to account for the move from bucket measurements to engine room intakes over the oceans in the (pre-)WW2 period. This adjustment serves to greatly reduce (not increase) the centennial scale surface temperature trend.

Finally, the finding of unequivocal warming does not rest solely upon surface temperature records. Rather it relies upon a broad suite of indicators (see e.g. FAQ2.1 of IPCC AR5) that all point unambiguously to the conclusion that Earth is running a fever. These findings and the recent surge in temperatures are corroborated by a broad range of other non-physical indicators (phenology, etc.) and also by a suite of modern reanalysis products. For so many analyses to be wrong is all but impossible. If the authors are correct they must explain away all these very many corroborating lines of evidence put together by a diverse range of groups using a huge range of measurements and analysis techniques. They can’t, and they won’t, instead preferring to cast doubt on small details, and making misleading assertions, all the while fervently hoping that their audience misses the big picture, to sow doubt and confusion.

","The authors of this article and of the study it references clearly have a very limited understanding of the painstaking methods used to ensure that surface temperature records are based on correct and unbiased measurements.

1. The adjustments are scientifically important, but rather modest for the global mean temperature.
2. The adjustments make the estimated warming smaller, not larger. Below are, for example, the raw and adjusted warming signals of the NASA GISS dataset. The how and why is discussed in this post.

3. Also without any thermometer it would be clear that the Earth is warming. Just look at sea ice, sea level rise, melting glaciers, later river freezing, earlier ice breakup, earlier spring and animal migration, movement of animals, plants, insects and ecosystems towards to poles and up mountains, etc.

",,,,“the adjusted data”,"It is surprising that, despite adjusted data being the crux of the arguments made here and in the study referred to, the author never explains why one may need to adjust measurements made on the ground or by satellites. There has been significant media coverage recently of some of the adjustments relating to temperature measurements made by satellites.

Simply from a practical standpoint, it is beneficial to consider what is involved in sustaining the orbit of a satellite. Once put into orbit, a satellite will slowly “decay” away from its intended orbit as it is pulled nearer to Earth by gravity and other effects. Unless it has its own propulsion to correct for this, it will eventually be pulled out of orbit.

This decay affects the exact time of day during which the satellite repeats measurements over one location. For example, from 1995 to 2005, the time of day that a NOAA satellite (NOAA-14) passed over the equator changed by more than 6 hours. The temperature in Quito at 12pm local time versus 6pm local time is quite different, so the satellite measurement must be corrected for this and other effects.

The warming estimated from adjusted data is smaller than it would have been without taking changes in the way observations were made into account.,,,"“This chart gives you a good idea of the direction of the adjustments.”

","The chart provides solely a view as to the changes in applied adjustments between consecutive versions of one product. It does not reflect the totality of the adjustments being applied. Showing total adjustments would highlight that these deltas were dwarfed by the existing adjustments applied to the 2008 version. Specifically, the very large spurious warming resulting from biases in the raw marine data record over the late 1930s / early 1940s. The net effect of adjustments in all datasets is to reduce the centennial timescale warming in all the surface temperature products.

","This chart does not show the adjustments. It shows an unsourced graph with the difference between two datasets. This is also due to increases in the amount of data used and thus also increases in coverage.

In as far as the reason are adjustments, a likely reason would be the adjustments of the sea surface temperature that make global warming smaller. Older bucket measurements are cooler than modern buoy measurements because the water cools by evaporation between taking the bucket out of the water and reading the thermometer. In the past these adjustments were thought to be larger than modern estimates.

So the “scandal” here would be that scientists were conservative in their early estimate of global warming.

",,,"“The blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer.”

","It does no such thing as both the series are adjusted. Hence it is impossible from the graph as constructed to make such an inference. To do so would require taking the adjusted data away from the raw data which is not what is being done here.

","Adjustments are made for good reasons. One of the most common ones is to account for a station located in a growing city, where the urban heat island effect would add spurious warming. In most cases the adjustments reduce, not increase, the warming in the record.

",,,“Note how most of the downward adjustments take place in the early twentieth century and most of the upward take place in the late twentieth century.”,"Even if all the adjustments were unjustified (as the Breitbart piece implies), they would only change the magnitude of the overall warming by about 0.1 °C; from about 1 °C to about 0.9 °C. This graph is nearly irrelevant to the question of anthropogenic warming!

It could also be mentioned that the 20th Century reanalysis* which uses NO temperature data from any stations found almost an identical warming (to within 0.1 °C) as 5 other series based on station data. The information in the Breitbart graph is irrelevant to the issue of anthropogenic warming; it is at most a footnote.

"The Atlantic accurately reports on study of the economic impacts of continued climate change in the US
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-atlantic-accurately-reports-study-economic-impacts-continued-climate-change-us-robinson-meyer/,The American South Will Bear the Worst of Climate Change’s Costs,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/global-warming-american-south/532200/,"Climate change will aggravate economic inequality in the United States, essentially transferring wealth from poor counties in the Southeast and the Midwest to well-off communities in the Northeast and on the coasts, according to the most detailed economic assessment of the phenomenon ever conducted.

The study, published Thursday in Science, simulates the costs of global warming in excruciating detail, modeling every day of weather in every U.S. county during the 21st century. It finds enormous disparities in how rising temperatures will affect American communities: Texas, Florida, and the Deep South will bleed income in the broiling heat, while some chillier northern states gain moderate benefits.

“We are really sure the South is going to get hammered,” says Solomon Hsiang, one of the authors of the paper and a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. “The South is really, really negatively affected by climate change, much more so than the North. That wasn’t something we were expecting going in.”

Overall, the paper finds that climate change will cost the United States 1.2 percent of its GDP for every additional degree Celsius of warming, though that figure is somewhat uncertain. If global temperatures rise by four degrees Celsius by 2100—which is very roughly where the current terms of the Paris Agreement would put the planet—U.S. GDP could shrink anywhere between 1.6 and 5.6 percent.

Yet beyond its initial findings, the paper represents a major breakthrough for the field of climate economics. Previously, the best financial forecasts of climate change approximated damages for the entire country at once. This new study worked from the bottom up, building its model from dozens of microeconomic studies into how climate change is already affecting regional economies across the United States. Every algorithm in the model emerges from a previously observed relationship in real-world data.

“This is like the adults entering the room. Economists have, for a quarter century, insisted that more work needs to be done to estimate climate damages. This team has done so,” said Gernot Wagner, a researcher Harvard University and the former lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, in an email. He was not connected to the study.

But this emphasis on the observed means that the research omitted many serious risks of climate change—even those the researchers considered important—if the data describing them was too paltry. The estimates do not include “non-market goods” like the loss of biodiversity or natural splendor. In other words: Most people agree that dead polar bears have an economic cost, but there’s no consensus on how to approximate it.

The study also doesn’t account for the increased likelihood of “tail risks”—that is, unlikely events with catastrophic consequences. Many researchers believe that global warming will make social strife, mass migration, or global military calamity more likely, but those events are, by definition, hard to predict. The same goes for economic disaster prompted by the onset of a “mega-drought” or the rapid collapse of the Greenland ice sheet.

“When we had the Dust Bowl, we saw everyone clear out of the Midwest and flood labor markets in the urban centers on the coast,” said Hsiang. Nothing like this kind of internal migration is modeled in the Science study.

All in all, the study’s assessments should be interpreted as the most rigorous attempt ever to describe what global warming will cost the United States in a “normal” world. It describes an America that has retained a well-organized economy, held together as a political community, and benefitted from the ongoing general global peace that began 70 years ago.

Even in that harmonious world, climate change will make the United States pay.

What Climate Change Will Cost Every U.S. County, 2080–2099Across the country’s southern half—and especially in states that border the Gulf of Mexico—climate change could impose the equivalent of a 20-percent tax on county-level income, according to the study. Harvests will dwindle, summer energy costs will soar, rising seas will erase real-estate holdings, and heatwaves will set off epidemics of cardiac and pulmonary disease.

The loss of human life dwarfs all the other economic costs of climate change. Almost every county between El Paso, Texas, and Charlotte, North Carolina, could see their mortality rate rise by more than 20 people out of every 100,000. By comparison, car accidents killed about 11 Americans out of every 100,000 in 2015.

But in the South and Southwest, other damages stack up. Some counties in eastern Texas could see agricultural yields fall by more than 50 percent. West Texas and Arizona may see energy costs rise by 20 percent.

How Climate Change Will Change Agriculture and Public Health by 2080  

Simultaneously, the study finds that some regions may reap moderate economic benefits from global warming. New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the Great Lake states may all prosper as growing seasons lengthen, and the number of frigid, deadly winter days decrease. In the most optimistic scenarios, some counties could see their incomes rise by 10 percent by the middle of the century.

This may make some Americans scratch their heads. The high costs of climate change will fall on many of the places where people today seem least worried about the phenomenon.

“Most of the risk maps show that climate change is going to be terrible for Trump country. Like, it’s not clear at all—from these maps—why reducing climate change is not a more urgent issue for Republicans, purely as a matter of representing their people,” said Joseph Majkut, the director of climate policy at the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank, in an email. He was not connected to the study.

Hsiang explained the disparity as a consequence of the hot places getting hotter.  “If you’re in a hot location already, then increasing the temperature tends to be much more damaging than if you’re somewhere that is cooler. Moving from 70 to 75 [degrees Fahrenheit] is not as big a deal as going from 90 to 95,” he told me. “The South, today, is already very hot. So as the country warms up, the South is disproportionately bearing the burden.”

In fact, the only factor of climate change that doesn’t specifically hurt the South is a projected rise in property crime associated with climate change. The incidence of nonviolent property crime doesn’t rise on summer days, but it tends to fall on the coldest days. “It’s hard to burgle houses or steal cars when there’s a lot of snow on the ground,” said Hsiang, laughing.

As the North’s winters get less icy, the region will see property-crime rates increase. But scorching summer days won’t alter the South’s crime rates. This is, however, a very small factor, Hsiang cautioned.

He also warned that the paper’s economic projections end in 2099. If climate change continues unabated into the 22nd century, the North will likely eventually “flip over” into much higher temperatures and more severe economic damages, Hsiang said.

The Science paper is the first product of the Climate Impact Lab, a 25-person consortium of economists and policy experts led by researchers from the University of California, the University of Chicago, Rutgers University, and the Rhodium Group. This study is the first part of their new global assessment of the economic costs of human-caused climate change.

“What has happened over the last 10 years is there’s been a revolution in our ability to measure the relationship between the climate and the economy, partly out of new, real-world data,” Hsiang told me. “This paper somewhat came out of the realization that all that new research wasn’t going anywhere. It wasn’t informing how we think about climate and the economy because those older models weren’t built in a way to absorb new findings.”

Their new program is called SEAGLAS. It’s designed to integrate new research into the regional and local effects of policy into a larger, holistic view of a certain country or part of the world. So while this study focused on U.S. county-level data about crime, human health, agriculture, labor supply, and energy demand, the researchers intend to fold new sectors and data sources into it in the future.

“It’s a great development, and the future of climate economics,” said Majkut. “This new study puts us on much more satisfying empirical ground as we consider the relationships between climate change and economic output. For that alone it should be praised.”

He did question one of the assumptions underlying the project: whether previously observed relationships will continue to hold in a future world. “If the high rates of human mortality can be eliminated or reduced with adaptation (more air conditioning, sports gels, better medicine, or people moving out of the South) then the economic picture really changes and the costs of climate will be reduced dramatically,” he said.

For that reason, Majkut said, “the research has a long way to go before it approaches anything like a comprehensive estimate of climate risk. Meanwhile, we emit.”

“SEAGLAS provides a terrific framework to build upon,” said Wagner in an email. “We’ve always known that there are enormous regional disparities across the globe. The fact that damages vary so much within a rich country like the U.S. is striking.”

So if climate modeling remains imperfect, what’s the point of doing it? Researchers have spent the last 25 years trying to forecast the economic damages of climate change. Eventually, they hope to arrive at the social cost of carbon—the damage to the economy dealt by every additional ton of carbon dioxide—which would inform the creation of a carbon tax. Yet across all those years, political opposition to a carbon tax has only hardened, and the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has only gone up.

Hsiang said that precision is still important. “If we have a rough number, is that good enough?” he asked. “I definitely think we’re never going to know the cost of climate change to seven decimal places. But it’s unclear what a rough number means, because there’s been very little benchmarking to any real-world data.” (An additional paper in this edition of Science clarifies that, so far, SEAGLAS has produced social costs of carbon that are fairly similar to two of the three most-famous economic climate models.)

“To be honest, transforming the global energy system is not a cheap task. It’s not a small thing,” Hsiang said. “And in some places, a lot of the concerns about implementing policy are related to concerns about the reliability of the numbers being used. It’s a little like the doctor coming in and saying you’re sick and he has some medicine which might work. You’ll feel much more comfortable about the medicine if you know there’s been clinical research and systematic control trials demonstrating it works.”",high,Accurate,101,"This story in The Atlantic by Robinson Meyer describes a new study on the distribution of economic impacts that result from continued climate change in the United States. The study finds that the impacts would not be uniform throughout the country, but would reduce GDP to a greater degree in southern states, for example, while the northernmost states could experience net economic benefits from warmer temperatures.

Scientists who reviewed the article indicate that it accurately summarizes the study, although the topic of climate impacts is broad and complex, and can inevitably benefit from additional context.

","The study makes an enormous contribution by updating aggregate economic reaction functions (sectoral and locational) across a large portion of the economy calibrated in currency and percentage changes in income for the end of the century) that will inform integrated assessment modeling efforts and estimates of the social cost of carbon for the United States.

Even though it is not completely comprehensive (so the estimates and ranges continue to be lower bounds of actual totals), the estimates are higher than earlier numbers and ranges because the analysis covers more ground very carefully and digs down to county level climate risks. Spatial variability makes the aggregates less subject to the downward push of aggregating over wider areas (i.e., highs and lows do not cancel as much).

Estimates of the social cost of carbon for the US should now be higher than before (they have persistently been orders of magnitude smaller than the world before now—a fact that led the EPA and the Supreme Court, to name two interested bodies, to use global estimates for the value of removing carbon emissions by, for example, raising CAFE standards for vehicles).

New York Times story highlights the growing number of extremely hot days in a warming world,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-story-highlights-the-growing-number-of-extremely-hot-days-in-a-warming-world-brad-plumer-n-popovich/,95-Degree Days: How Extreme Heat Could Spread Across the World,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/22/climate/95-degree-day-maps.html,"Extremely hot days, when temperatures soar to 95 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, can be miserable. Crops wilt in the fields. Electric grids strain to keep pace with demand. People are at greater risk of dying. And those hot temperatures are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades.

The map above, based on a new analysis from the Climate Impact Lab, shows how 95-degree days (35 degrees Celsius) are expected to multiply this century if countries take moderate climate action. In this scenario, countries would take some measures, but not drastic ones, to curb emissions — roughly the trajectory of the current pledges under the Paris climate agreement.

The resulting global warming would still cause significant shifts for many cities. In Washington, from 1986 to 2005, an average of seven days each year had temperatures of at least 95 degrees. By the end of the century, the city can expect 29 of these extremely hot days per year, on average. (The likely range is 14 to 46 hot days per year.)

Phoenix is used to the heat, averaging 124 days per year with 95-degree weather. At the end of the century, that’s expected to increase to around 155 days — an extra month of extreme temperatures each year. Madrid would go from eight severely hot days per year to 43, Beijing from nine to 35.

The swings are even greater closer to the equator. New Delhi, India’s capital city, has historically averaged 105 days with temperatures of at least 95 degrees each year. That’s likely to rise to a range of 137 to 200 days per year.

Things could get worse if countries fail to take action
If the world’s nations took no action on global warming, and emissions continued to rise at the same pace they did in the first decade of this century — with total global warming of 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the end of the century — extremely hot days would become much more commonplace.

Global warming if no action is taken

By 2100, Washington could swelter in 95-degree weather for fully one-fifth of the year — around 74 days, on average. Large swaths of Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa would experience these temperatures for most of the year.

This worst case for global warming now appears less likely as global coal use declines and nations slowly move toward cleaner energy.

How 95-degree days disrupt our everyday lives
In the United States, electricity use soars as temperatures rise and more households use air-conditioning more frequently. One recent study found that the United States’ electric grid would have to handle a 7.2 percent increase in peak demand this century under a moderate warming scenario.

As temperature increases:

The flip side is that air-conditioning can be an essential adaptation tactic. In countries without widespread cooling, heat deaths rise more sharply during the hottest days. One study estimated that heat deaths in India increase by 3.2 percent for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit above 68 (or every 1 degree Celsius above 20). Energy use in many countries may rise sharply as people struggle to adapt to a hotter climate.

Other scientists have found that corn and soybean yields in the United States plummet precipitously when temperatures rise above 84 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius), and that worker productivity declines sharply, particularly for outdoor jobs. And researchers are trying to understand how crime and conflict might rise as temperatures increase.

Ultimately, people will be better able to adapt if they have a better idea of what individual cities and regions can expect, said Trevor Houser, who co-directs the Climate Impact Lab. In the United States, some urban planners are already experimenting with techniques like adding green spaces or increasing the reflectivity of rooftops to cool down city centers during heat waves.

“Right now, when you start talking to people about higher temperatures, they tend to think, great, more beach days,” said Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley who helps direct the lab. “What’s often less appreciated is just how much an extremely hot day can distort our lives in all sorts of ways we don’t often even think about.”",high,Accurate,132,"This article in the New York Times is organized around maps of projected increases in extremely hot weather because of human-caused climate change. Scientists who reviewed the article indicate that climate model projections are accurately represented, and some of the impacts of hot weather (e.g. impacts on health, crop yields)  are briefly summarized.

","Overall, I think this is a great article and tool. We certainly need to increase people’s understanding of this problem and this certainly helps with that.

","The article describes projections of extreme heat days by the end of the century, providing further support for a well-known risk of climate change. The projections are based on exposure-response relationships from a period when there was generally low awareness of the risks of extreme heat. Awareness has been increasing with the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, as has implementation of heatwave early warning systems and other adaptation options, resulting in a decline in heat-related mortality in recent years in many locations. As heatwave-related mortality increases, it is difficult to imagine individuals and governments not taking action to reduce risks. Much better understanding is needed of how to motivate a proactive adaptation. The extent to which air conditioning could be an effective option in low and middle income countries will depend on how development will evolve in these countries, including electrification. The projections confirm the importance of rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid larger risks later in the century.

Breitbart misrepresents research from 58 scientific papers to falsely claim that they disprove human-caused global warming,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/breitbart-misrepresents-research-58-scientific-papers-falsely-claim-disprove-human-caused-global-warming-james-delingpole/,"Global Warming’ Is a Myth, Say 58 Scientific Papers in 2017",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/06/06/delingpole-global-warming-is-myth-58-scientific-papers-2017/,"“Global warming” is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.

In other words, the so-called “Consensus” on global warming is a massive lie. And Donald Trump was quite right to quit the Paris agreement which pretended that the massive lie was true.

By “global warming” these papers don’t, of course, mean the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century as the world crawled out of the Little Ice Age. Pretty much everyone, alarmists and skeptics alike, is agreed on that.

Rather, they mean “global warming” in the sense that is most commonly used today by grant-troughing scientists, and huxter politicians, and scaremongering green activists, and brainwashed mainstream media (MSM) environmental correspondents. “Global warming” as in the scary, historically unprecedented, primarily man-made phenomenon which we must address urgently before the icecaps melt and the Pacific islands disappear beneath the waves and all the baby polar bears drown.

What all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming — aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) — is a fake artefact.

That is, all these different experts from around the world — China, Russia, Canada, the U.S., Italy, etc. — have been looking closely at different aspects of the global warming puzzle in various regions and on different timescales and come to the conclusion in irreproachable, peer-reviewed scientific ways that there is no evidence to support the global warming scare story.

Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary.

Here, as collated by Kenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone, are just some of the charts to prove it.

Büntgen et al, below, shows that temperatures in the northern hemisphere were warmer in the early 1400s than they are today

Abrantes et al (below) confirms the traditional view — which Michael Mann tried to dismiss with his discredited Hockey Stick chart — that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than anything we have experienced in our own era.

Here’s one from Li et al showing that China was much warmer 8,000 years ago

Here’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries:

And on and on it goes — there are 80 graphs in all, each showing in its different way why the scare about global warming has been horribly overdone because the evidence just doesn’t support its being unusual or a problem. Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity. Few, if any, entertain the notion that carbon dioxide levels have much to do with it.

The intellectually corrupt and mendacious alarmist science establishment — I’m thinking, for example, of my personal bete noir, the left-wing political activist and Nobel-prizewinning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse, former president of the Royal Society — would have us believe that climate skepticism is a minority activity, the preserve of a few cranks, championed only by people who don’t do the science. But this is just ugly propaganda.

Here are dozens of reputable scientists from around the world with no axe to grind collaborating on studies which all corroborate, independently and rigorously, the increasingly respectable view that “man-made global warming” just isn’t a thing.

Not that it ever was a thing, really. This debate — as I argue at some length in Watermelons — was always about left-wing ideology, quasi-religious hysteria, and “follow the money” corruption, never about “science.”

Still, it’s always a comfort to know that “the science” is on our side too.

","Dan Jones, Physical Oceanographer, British Antarctic Survey:","This piece is a logically flawed “straw man argument”. Delingpole claims to have disproven human-driven climate change, but he does not engage with how climate change actually works.

Human-driven climate change is primarily about the effects of carbon dioxide on the entire climate system. When more carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere via fossil fuel burning, more energy ultimately reaches Earth’s surface. This extra energy ends up in the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere (i.e., sea ice and land ice).

To see the clearest fingerprints of the extra energy added to the climate system from fossil fuel burning, you have to look at the energy content of the entire climate system over the last several decades (most of the extra energy has gone into the ocean [Levitus et al. 2012]*). Trying to disprove global warming in recent decades using regional, seasonal, atmosphere-only temperature trends on centuries-long timescales is very misleading.

But it shows nothing of the sort; it is based on a complete misunderstanding of the space-time variability of the atmosphere. The article commits two common, but fundamental errors that totally invalidate its claims.

The first two charts are both of spatially global scale (the northern hemisphere), they illustrate the time scale error. They show northern hemisphere temperatures with millennial scale fluctuations (changes) of the order of 1°C; the so-called “medieval warming event”. Irrespective of whether these reconstructions are accurate (the global—not European—extent of the warming is the question under debate), the change occurred over time scales much longer than the 1°C warming that occurred over the last century. In the pre-industrial period, typical century long, global scale temperature fluctuations were about 0.2°C (i.e. typical century to century changes, see figure below); therefore if the temperature fluctuations followed the usual “bell-curve”, then a 1°C change in a century would have a probability of about one in 3 million of occurring naturally, the giant natural fluctuation hypothesis could easily be rejected. However, it was found that the bell curve under estimates the extreme 3% of the temperature fluctuations: extreme “black swan” events occur much more frequently than expected, yet, even when these rare extremes are taken into account, the probability of a 1°C change in a century is still less than 0.1%, it can easily be rejected1.

The other fundamental error is also a scale error, but now in space rather than in time. This error is well exemplified in the fourth graph which shows data indirectly reflecting temperatures in France. Yet France is only about 0.1% of the global surface area, so that large natural fluctuations are common but are not of global significance. A common “skeptic” talking point is the fact that between 1662 and 1762, the temperature in central England increased by nearly 1 °C, i.e., about the same as the global temperature over the last century. Unfortunately for the “skeptics”, central England (greater London) is about 0.01% of the earth’s surface area so that it is not surprising that over the same period, the Northern Hemisphere temperature only increased by 0.2 °C (equal to the typical centennial change!).

Finally, the third graph from China combines the two errors: the times scales are way too long and the spatial scales are way too small; it is doubly irrelevant to the question of anthropogenic global warming.

",,,,"“Here’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries
","The Guillet et al paper primarily uses wine grapes to look at the impact of the 1257 Samalas eruption (volcanic aerosols cool the climate, delaying grape maturation and harvest). I haven’t read the paper in the detail, but as far as I can tell they do not make any claims about recent warming or harvest trends.

Contrary to the claim quoted above, our own work suggest that warming has significantly advanced wine grape harvests over western Europe1.

We found, on average, that winegrape harvests have been occurring significantly earlier since 1980 (on average 10 days earlier than the 1600-1900 average). In fact, 2003 was the earliest harvest in the record by about a month.

On a broader note, I want to point out that exceptional events in the paleoclimate record do not undermine the case for attributing recent warming to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. We know there have been warm periods in the past, but we have quite a bit of significant independent evidence that recent warming can only be explained by invoking anthropogenic activities.
[read the Dr Guillet’s comment below]

Nature Climate Change",,,,“the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century”,"This figure [0.8°C] is generally accurate. Global average air temperature has increased by just under 1.0ºC, according to NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and confirmed by numerous other organizations:

Source: NASA GISS

However, it is quite disingenuous to suggest that warming the entire atmosphere by this amount is “mild.”
Yes, it is a relatively mild adjustment on your home thermostat, increasing the temperature by less than one degree. For Americans, if your home is heated to 65ºF and you increase the temperature by 1ºF, that is equivalent to about a 0.6ºC increase. Heating the amount of air in your home is quite a different matter than heating the entire atmosphere. Just to start, the atmosphere has an approximate mass of 5 x 10^18 kg—that’s 5 quintillion kg or 11 quintillion pounds. In just over 100 years or so, we’ve increased the global air temperature thermostat by a staggering 0.8ºC—and we’re still emitting the greenhouse gases responsible for the warming.",,,,"“Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity. Few, if any, entertain the notion that carbon dioxide levels have much to do with it.”
","Many of these papers discuss the causes of temperature changes over the past several centuries or millennia. Indeed, solar activity is thought to be one of the primary drivers of the observed temperature variability over this these longer time periods. This is not the case over the past several decades. Over this recent time period we know that the Sun’s intensity has not gotten stronger because we are measuring it with satellites and we know that increasing greenhouse gasses are causing warming. We know that increasing greenhouse gasses are causing warming due to fundamental physical laws—not simply from observing that temperatures and greenhouse gas levels happen to be rising at the same time.

",,,,"“collaborating on studies which all corroborate, independently and rigorously, the increasingly respectable view that ‘man-made global warming’ just isn’t a thing.”

","These studies do not make this claim. Most of them are about regional (not global) temperature variations of the distant past. They generally make no claims regarding the causes of global warming over the most recent several decades nor do they make any claims about the amount of warming expected as we continue to increase greenhouse gas concentrations.

","This false statement is based on a list of figures taken completely out of context. For instance, No Tricks Zone [the blog Breitbart is using as a source] takes a figure from Markle et al., (2017)1 and assumes the x-axis refers to years before present. With this incorrect interpretation, it seems as though ocean temperature anomalies are very low at year 0. However, these plots show the result of simulations of idealized Dansgaard-Oeschger or Antarctic Isotope Maximum events in a general circulation model. Year 0 is simply the beginning of the simulated event and is not displaying actual modern sea surface temperature data (i.e. year 0 is not today, 0 years before present).
Not only is this a red herring, it is a completely misinterpreted red herring.
They also repeat the favorite Antarctic cooling cherry, taking (and altering) a figure from Mayewski et al., (2017)2 which shows Antarctic-wide climate reanalysis temperature data. As a continent (larger than the US lower-48), Antarctica is not warming. This is because much of high, dry East Antarctica is not warming. However, important areas of Antarctica, including West Antarctica which likely would show about a 0.2ºC per decade warming trend over the reanalysis period (from 1979 to present, since satellites have given good data coverage). Climate is incredibly variable around Antarctica, and also through time (large interannual variability). This is well studied, but if you only look at one graph rather than reading the research papers you will not be aware of this.

"Playing semantics, misleading Breitbart article downplays US contribution to climate change",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/playing-semantics-misleading-breitbart-article-downplays-us-contribution-to-climate-change/,WHO: United States Among Least Polluting Nations on the Planet,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/06/05/who-united-states-among-least-polluting-nations-on-the-planet/,"Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet.

In the most recent WHO report on air pollution, the United States was listed as one of the countries with the cleanest air in the world, significantly cleaner in fact than the air in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the UK, Japan, Austria and France.

While France and other G7 countries lamented the U.S. exit from the Paris climate accord, America’s air is already cleaner than that of any other country in the G7, except Canada with its scant population.

Following standard practice, the WHO measures air pollution by the mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter. These are the particles that cause diseases of all sorts and are responsible for most deaths by air pollution.

According to the WHO, exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.

The report, which analyzed the “annual median concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) for both urban population and rural and urban population” found that the United States was one of the most pollution-free nations in the world.

The annual mean concentrations of particulate matter in the air range from less than 10 to over 100 µg/m3, the report states. At the very low end of the spectrum, the United States has a concentration of just 8, while China has a concentration more than seven times higher at 59, India at 66, Egypt at 101 and Saudi Arabia with the worst air pollution at 127.

“The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter is a common measure of air pollution,” the WHO states.

The WHO report is corroborated by a series of other such studies on air and water pollution.

In a recent list of the 25 cleanest cities in the world, the only country to boast three cities among the cleanest on the planet was the United States of America, with Chicago coming in second place, Honolulu coming in fourth, and Portland, OR, coming in sixteenth. Unsurprisingly, no cities from China, Russia or India made the list at all.

Similarly, another list of the 15 most polluted cities in the world featured three cities from China, three cities from Saudi Arabia, and a whopping seven cities from India. No U.S. city made the list.

A third list, ranking the ten cleanest and ten most polluted cities in the world, placed two U.S. cities on the list of cleanest cities on the planet. The list of the most polluted cities in the world was led by two cities from China followed by two more cities from India. Two Russian cities also made the list. Again, no U.S. cities were found here.

With such relatively clean air throughout America, how can even reputable news agencies like Reuters continue spreading the well-worn lie that the United States is one of the “biggest polluters” in the world?

Rather than follow the time-tested practice used by the World Health Organization, which measures levels of disease-causing pollutants that get into people’s lungs, some have played a shell game, swapping a new measure of “pollution” based solely on emissions of carbon dioxide.

The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever.

Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.

Current levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the environment are substantially lower than they have been during earlier periods in the planet’s history. Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm.

Some experts, such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany, have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity. Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere “is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally.”

“The benefits are real, whereas the costs of warming are uncertain,” he said.

While the United States must remain vigilant to keep the level of real, dangerous pollutants to a minimum, it may take some consolation in the fact that among G7 nations, it has the cleanest air of all.",very_low,"Biased, Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Misleading",153,"This article at Breitbart argues that World Health Organization rankings of particulate matter air quality show that the United States is not one of the biggest polluters in the context of the Paris Agreement. Scientists who reviewed the article explain that this is misleading. Air quality is not an indication of national greenhouse gas emissions—and the United States is currently the second-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. This is true regardless of whether one uses the term “pollution” to describe carbon dioxide emissions.

",,,,,"Michael Brauer, Professor, The University of British Columbia
","The facts in the article are correct but the entire premise is deliberately misleading—it is correct that with respect to CONCENTRATIONS (i.e. the level is in the air) of one type of health-damaging air pollutant, the US is one of the countries with the lowest concentrations in the world. However, the Paris Accord is related to EMISSIONS (how much is released into the air) of climate-forcing pollutants and in that context the U.S. is among the countries in the world with both the highest overall emissions and the highest emissions per capita (higher than all other OECD countries). For climate change, EMISSIONS are what matters.
","Aimée Slangen, Researcher, Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ)
","This whole post is based on semantics and basically one big strawman fallacy. The author is deliberately confusing air pollution from suspended particulate matter (as discussed in the WHO report) with pollution from carbon dioxide emissions (as discussed in the Reuters link and the Paris Agreement). Even though CO2 does not impact our health through “disease-causing pollutants that get into people’s lungs”, it does change our environment and the Earth’s climate, and in that sense does classify as a pollutant.
","Pierre Friedlingstein, Professor, University of Exeter
","Deliberately misleading about the role of CO2 and whether it is a pollutant or not, minimizing the role of CO2 as a greenhouse gas agent leading to climate change.
","Dan Jones, Physical Oceanographer, British Antarctic Survey
","Should we call carbon dioxide a “pollutant”? That question is relevant for policy, but either way, our choice of language does not change how physics behaves. When you add more carbon dioxide to Earth’s lower atmosphere, you get more energy at Earth’s surface. The extra energy added by human emissions of CO2 has to go somewhere; it isn’t going to just disappear. It ends up in the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere, affecting Earth’s climate system and putting us at risk for negative climate impacts (e.g. sea level rise, heat waves of increasing frequency and intensity, shifts in precipitation patterns). The author claims that this additional warming might actually be beneficial overall, which is inconsistent with the body of scientific literature on the topic (as always, see IPCC for summary).

In short, this article makes a number of misleading statements and casually dismisses volumes of scientific evidence.
","Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University
","This article willingly confuses air pollution by particulate matter and greenhouse gas emissions. The article cherry-picks skeptic claims and out-of-context scientific evidence like deep-past CO2 atmospheric levels to try to make the case that CO2 emissions and climate change are not an issue. It tries to deny the fact that the US is a large climate change “polluter”, in the sense that it emits a lot of greenhouse gas per capita, by using the old, tired talking point that CO2 is not a pollutant, and that otherwise US air pollution is pretty low. Irrelevant and misleading.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet.”
","This Breitbart article is playing with words, arguing that CO2 is not a “pollutant”. When it comes to CO2, the US is the second largest emitter after China. CO2 is a greenhouse gas, primarily responsible for climate change, inducing negative impacts on human and ecosystems. Replace the word “polluter” with “emitter” and the whole article falls apart—there is no story here.
","This presumes a strong link between the cleanliness of a country’s air and its own emissions. This does not necessarily hold. For example, the tiny papal state of the Vatican City is probably rather polluted (as it’s contained solely within the city of Rome). However, the vast majority of that pollution will have been emitted in Italy.",,,"“While France and other G7 countries lamented the U.S. exit from the Paris climate accord, America’s air is already cleaner than that of any other country in the G7, except Canada with its scant population.”","The Breitbart author must know that the Paris Agreement is about climate change, not about air quality.",,,,"“the WHO measures air pollution by the mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter.

According to the WHO, exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.

The report […] found that the United States was one of the most pollution-free nations in the world.”

","The particulate matter (PM) discussion is essentially correct. PM is indeed thought to cause far more deaths than any other air pollutant. The United States indeed has lower PM2.5 levels than most other countries, especially when comparing cities. Most of the country outside California attains EPA’s 12 ug/m3 PM2.5 standard.

“Most pollution-free” is poorly worded, since of course no populated area is ‘pollution-free’. But yes, PM2.5 levels in urban and rural areas of the United States are lower than those in corresponding areas of many other countries.

The article misleads by conflating levels of air pollution with terminology like “most polluting” or “biggest polluters”. Relatively clean air quality in the United States does not negate the fact that we are the world’s second largest emitter of CO2.

",,,,"“With such relatively clean air throughout America, how can even reputable news agencies like Reuters continue spreading the well-worn lie that the United States is one of the ‘biggest polluters’ in the world?”","Reuters is simply saying that in terms of CO2 emissions, China is the top emitter and the USA is second. There is no point denying this. It’s a fact, based on national fossil fuel production and consumption inventories. Whether you call CO2 “pollutant” or not is irrelevant. It is the main driver of climate change.
","America has the largest economy and the 3rd largest population on Earth. Even if each of its factories and people themselves emitted less than in most other countries, it would still add up to being one of the biggest polluters.
","As the author pretends not to understand, this is the case if one considers greenhouse gas emissions as part of pollution. While China’s emissions grew tremendously over the last couple decades and it overtook the US as the largest total emitter a few years ago, the US is still one of the largest emitters per capita.

In addition, historically, the US (and the EU) still own the largest share of cumulative emissions since the preindustrial era when emissions began.
",,"“While the United States must remain vigilant to keep the level of real, dangerous pollutants to a minimum, it may take some consolation in the fact that among G7 nations, it has the cleanest air of all.”

","Carbon dioxide is a well-mixed greenhouse gas—its concentrations are roughly 407 ppm everywhere across the globe. The national concentration bears absolutely no relevance to the country’s emissions.

",,,,"“The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever.
Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”

","Again, the point is not “is CO2 a pollutant or not”. (I believe the Supreme Court said it is.) The point is: CO2 emissions in the atmosphere lead to climate change as CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Climate change has and will have negative impact on ecosystems (land and ocean). The author deliberately ignores this.

","While the CO2 does not impact our health through “disease-causing pollutants that get into people’s lungs”, it does change our environment and the Earth’s climate, and in that sense it does classify as a pollutant.

","This statement is absolutely ridiculous. It violates the most basic, fundamental maxim of toxicology, first articulated by the Renaissance physician Paracelsus:
“The dose makes the poison.” Or, “All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison.”

In other words, just because a substance at one concentration is harmless does not mean it is harmless at another concentration. We don’t normally think of consumption of water as harmful to humans, but at high enough doses it will kill—and has done so.

A pollutant is generally defined as a substance—artificial (synthetic) or natural—that occurs in the environment at least in part because of human activity, and that has a deleterious impact on living systems.

Given that basic definition, there is no way that CO2 can not be a pollutant. It is produced by a variety of human activities, but principally burning of fossil fuels. Increases in its concentration are clearly linked to global warming, which has already, and increasingly will, negatively affect living systems, including humans. The only exit from this logic is to deny that CO2 leads to warming (in contradiction to massive scientific evidence) or to deny that warming negatively impacts living systems (again in contradiction to massive evidence).

The authors use a classic rhetorical ploy to confound bits of information and draw erroneous conclusions. Yes, at low concentrations CO2 is not directly harmful to humans, and in fact is required by plants. And yes, small increases in CO2 have been shown to increase plant growth. (Some of my own work has shown such; such increases also shift the chemical composition of plant tissues, and not always for the better!). Plants grown under elevated CO2 do grow faster. To my knowledge, there is no evidence that they are “stronger” (whatever that means), and if anything, they are less green. Nor is there convincing evidence they are healthier. If anything, insects consume them more than ambient-CO2 plants.

","This depends on the definition of “pollutant”. To the extent that CO2-induced global warming endangers human welfare and health, CO2 fits the Clean Air Act’s broad definition of “air pollutants”—that’s the reasoning behind the Supreme Court’s decision to let the EPA regulate CO2 emissions.

Not that this is relevant to the definition of CO2 as a pollutant (which relies on it causing climate change), but the alleged total non-toxicity is not entirely true: there is some research* showing impairments in cognitive function test scores in people exposed to CO2 concentrations in the 950-1,000 ppm range, and even significantly worse performance when CO2 rose to 1500 and 2,500 ppm. Current atmospheric CO2 is around 400 ppm—possibly going up at least a few more hundred ppm this century without emission cuts—but concentrations greater than ~1000 ppm are often found in poorly ventilated rooms and buildings.

Allen et al (2016) Associations of cognitive function scores with carbon dioxide, ventilation, and volatile organic compound exposures in office workers: a controlled exposure study of green and conventional office environments, Environmental Health Perspectives","“Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm.”","A CO2 concentration of 7000 ppm is a model estimate (not observations) for the Cambrian, about 500 million years ago. There are obviously no measures of temperature for that time, but estimates from models are about 10°C (18°F) warmer than present day! Not exactly reassuring news…

","But those worlds were rather different to those that humans inhabit. They had things like palm trees and crocodiles in the Arctic, and arguably land in the Tropics was completely sterile because of the heat.

",,,"“Some experts, such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany, have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity. Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere ‘is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally.”
","I don’t believe that Dr. Goklany was ever employed or seconded to the UN. In fact, he would appear to be working for the climate-dismissing think tank, the Heartland Institute.

","Technically, there is no such thing, really, as a UN climate scientist. There are climate scientists, worldwide, working for universities or national research organizations, and who contribute to the UN’s IPCC review process when it produces its report, every 7 years or so. Dr. Goklany is listed (Wikipedia) as working for the US Department of Interior as a science and technology policy analyst. His PhD is in electrical engineering, and beyond opinion pieces, he doesn’t seem to have published in the field of climate sciences.
So I am not sure why his opinion is relevant at all—it goes without saying that it goes against the assessment of most of the scientific community working on climate change issues.

","Dr. Goklany is one of the very few defending that view. IPCC AR5* is very clear: “Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.”

"In Paris Agreement op-ed, US Senator Ted Cruz misrepresents the costs and benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/paris-agreement-op-ed-us-senator-ted-cruz-misrepresents-costs-benefits-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions/,Ted Cruz: Trump should withdraw from Paris climate pact,http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/29/opinions/withdraw-paris-accord-opinion-cruz/,"CNN —  
Following a successful international tour and the G-7 Summit in Italy, President Trump has an opportunity to relieve our nation of the unfair and economically devastating requirements of the Paris Agreement, the United Nations climate treaty he pledged to rip up during the campaign.

And as soon as possible, President Trump should act on – and keep – his campaign promise.

The agreement, signed by the Obama administration last year, would commit the United States to drastically reducing its carbon emissions while allowing some countries to increase theirs. This, all while doing nothing to meaningfully decrease global temperatures.

According to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study, the Paris Agreement could obliterate $3 trillion of GDP, 6.5 million industrial sector jobs and $7,000 in per capita household income from the American economy by 2040. Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs. The cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21% 19%, and 11% respectively.

Not only would these unfair standards reduce American job growth and wages and increase monthly utility costs for hardworking families, they would fundamentally disadvantage the United States in the global economy. The result: our economic output would lag while other countries continued to expand their GDPs.

The agreement’s proponents market it as a panacea for addressing the impacts of climate change, but at its core, it is about increasing government control – over the economy, the energy sector and nearly every aspect of our daily lives. It represents the exact misguided, top-down, government-knows-best approach that American voters resoundingly rejected in 2016.

We cannot pursue a path that puts American workers first if we cripple a fossil fuel energy sector that generates 82% of the energy consumed in the United States. The coal industry alone supplies almost one-third of America’s electric power – with an increasing amount of clean coal-burning technology becoming available.

America is poised to become a net energy exporter over the next decade. We should not abandon that progress at the cost of weakening our energy renaissance and crippling economic growth.

And let’s not forget the massive utility cost increases the agreement would entail. The Clean Power Plan, a major component of fulfilling the agreement, would spike energy costs for working and middle-class Texans by 16% by 2030, according to the Economic Reliability Council of Texas, the entity that operates the electric grid for much of our state.

We simply cannot afford an agreement that puts thousands of Americans out of work, increases their energy costs and devastates our core industries.

In return for crippling our economy, the Paris Agreement would do next to nothing to impact global temperatures. Under the EPA’s own models, if all carbon emissions in America were basically eliminated, global temperatures would only decrease by less than two-tenths of a degree Celsius.

While the agreement would have a negligible impact on temperatures, America would be putting itself at a competitive disadvantage. That’s because while the Obama administration irresponsibly committed America to immediate, real cuts in emissions, our global economic competitors would have no such handicap. In fact, Russia is permitted to increase its emissions approximately 50% and China and India have no meaningful cap on emissions until 2030.

This disparity among the countries’ pledges inflicts real losses on our economy now while our rivals continue to grow, industrialize and diversify at their own pace with no implementation costs. In the meantime, the agreement would force American taxpayers to subsidize alternative energy at the expense of clean coal, nuclear power and natural gas – energy resources that actually work for our economy and our environment.

The Paris Agreement would also handicap America in the global race for new sources of energy. Russia has committed financial and military assets to the Arctic to stake its claim to the region’s vast deepwater mineral, oil and gas deposits. China is also exploring and trading for Arctic oil and gas. Meanwhile, American liquefied natural gas struggles with logistical costs that weaken its competitiveness.

By allowing our rivals to increase their cooperation and strategic leverage around the world – pressuring our allies and partners, harming domestic job creators and materially reducing our prestige and influence in the process — the agreement would damage America’s national security as much as our economic security. The emission cuts that the US would have to make today, and the resultant costs for our own energy firms, would weaken our ability to battle our rivals on an equal footing in the drive for untapped energy sources.

Efforts to unwind some of the deal’s more onerous regulations are welcomed, but that is not enough. Unless the US completely withdraws, the Paris Agreement will continue to cause sustained harm to our security and economy, and it keeps the door open for future administrations to use it as means to impose more costly and ineffective energy regulations.

We should not let a deal subject to the whims of future administrations or Congresses hang like a wet blanket over our economy – driving up energy prices, devastating our industrial base and bolstering our rivals.

I hope President Trump will take the opportunity before him to fulfill the commitment he made and withdraw America from the Paris Agreement.",very_low,"Biased, Inaccurate, Misleading",390,"In an op-ed published by CNN, US Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) argues for a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, an international agreement with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming. Sen. Cruz’s argument is based on claims about the climate impact of cutting greenhouse gas emissions (which he says is limited) and the economic impacts of emissions reductions (which he says are dramatic).

We asked researchers to evaluate whether these claims reflected the scientific state of knowledge on these topics. The reviewers indicated that Sen. Cruz’s article cites a single report that assessed only the costs of climate actions, relying on a series of assumptions that maximized those estimated costs, and that excluded the benefits of avoided climate change and of renewable sources of energy.

","The claims that the Paris Accord would only produce negligible benefits is just wrong—it is the start of an iterative response that minimizes the cost of meeting any long term goal like a 2 °C target. The jobs lost claim is just hyperbole and misdirection (e.g. the demand side is costing coal jobs—a trend that started before Obama became President and that will not be reversed by Presidential Orders that open more supply). Moreover, it ignores jobs created in alternative energy design, installation, and maintenance.

","[Comment taken from an evaluation of similar statements.]
The statement about the climate impact of the Paris Agreement is incorrect. The figure below, appropriated from Fawcett et al (2015)*, displays the nuances of correctly projecting the impact of the Paris Accord through 2100. Business as usual creates an emission trajectory that rapidly passes by 80 gigatons of CO2 per year by 2070; the likelihood of seeing warming less than 3 °C through 2100 along this path is 10% with a median of more than 4 °C. Abiding by the Paris Accord through 2030 and continuing its momentum through 2100 would increase that likelihood to nearly 60% with a median somewhere around 2.5 °C – a reduction of approximately 1.5 °C and not 0.2 °C.

","The Paris Climate Agreement alone will not solve the climate change problem (meaning we need even more action, not less). It puts us on the right track, though.
See the Climate Action Tracker website for details.

",,,"“According to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study, the Paris Agreement could obliterate $3 trillion of GDP, 6.5 million industrial sector jobs and $7,000 in per capita household income from the American economy by 2040. Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs. The cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21% 19%, and 11% respectively.”

","It is true that this is what the NERA study says, with many caveats. However, this statement is misleading and taken out of context. There are three reasons for this.

First, and most importantly, the NERA study looked at the costs of a hypothetical set of policy actions. These may not be the actions that will be taken to comply with the Paris Agreement. One could easily model other actions with much lower costs.
Second, it is only the costs that are modeled. The benefits from avoiding climate change (sea level rise, greater storm surges, greater spread of diseases, etc.) are entirely ignored. The net costs from the policies would be entirely different and likely even positive.

Third, there is some cherry-picking going on here. The NERA model is known to be inflexible in how it allows for innovation to influence economic activity, and thus it tends to provide much higher cost estimates than other well-known models such as the U.S. Department of Energy’s NEMS or ICF Consulting’s IPM. The NERA model provides useful information, but it is important for it to be taken in context of model results from other models and not cherry-picked as was done here.

","The claim on jobs lost is totally unsubstantiated by any scientific assessment. Depending on HOW we decide to decarbonize, the effect on jobs could be either positive or negative. In general, the large investments in infrastructure required might increase jobs. This is not accounting for the totally unrelated reduction in jobs that will be most likely materialize due to robots*.

","[Comment taken from an evaluation of similar statements.]
The numbers he quotes are from an analysis that adds new meaning to the term “business as usual”. They look to frame their vision of the future on the basis of static behavior across major sectors of the economy; i.e., they do not allow their sectors to adapt their business operations in response to changes in their economic environment. This allows the analysis to report prices for carbon that vary by orders of magnitude across 4 major sectors and leads them to expecting investment to fall by nearly 20% at a time when increasing investment in alternative energy and new production technologies would allow them to grow their profits and support more jobs. The reported losses in jobs, GDP, and personal income are the result of these rigid assumptions and not their similarly rigid depictions of how the US would implement its plan to meet its Paris Accord target.

Rather than quote a different report from a different set of experts that show economic growth in both GDP and employment (though they exist, doing so would fall into the same ordering trap as the Senator), let’s look at the recent experience in the United States. The first figure below shows that US carbon emissions have fallen by 14% since 2006, a period of time during which the unemployment rate also fell from nearly 9% to around 4.4% and the annual rate of GDP growth climbed to the historically normal range of 1.5% to 2%.

The second figure shows emissions falling in California by nearly 8% since 2008 partly in response to a cap and trade program that has generated $4billion in revenue—revenue that has been used to support investment in adaptation and simultaneous expansion of the employment of less carbon intensive and/or carbon free sources of energy at scale. Over the same period, California GDP has climbed by nearly 10%. These simple economic observations contradict the Senator’s claims.

","The National Economic Research Associates study assumes that the United States meets the 2025 target for reducing annual emissions of greenhouse gases, which is set out in its “nationally determined contribution”, and goes on to reduce its annual emissions by 80% by 2050 compared with 1990.

The authors of the study admit on pages 10-11 to making the astonishing assumption that every other country in the world ignores the targets in their nationally determined contributions and make no further efforts to reduce emissions, so that much of the calculated costs to the United States economy subsequently arise from high-carbon companies relocate or lose business to competitors in other countries.

The model assumes no increase in low-carbon electricity generation over the next four decades compared with the baseline scenario, so no increase in economic growth or jobs in the low-carbon sector and no substitution of low-carbon energy for high-carbon energy—emissions reductions are achieved by imposing very high carbon prices that reduce the consumption of coal and energy.

The study makes the unrealistic assumption that there will be no economic benefits to the United States from avoided impacts of climate change or co-benefits from reducing local air pollution from fossil fuels which currently contributes to the premature deaths of 200,000 Americans each year, according to a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology*.

Overall, this is an inaccurate and misleading assessment of the cost to the United States of participating in the Paris Agreement and honouring the commitments in its nationally determined contribution—indeed, the extreme assumptions mean this a study of the costs of policy-makers attempting to achieve emissions reduction targets in some of the least cost-effective ways available.

","This is possible, but hard to defend based on the evidence known today. Regulations to reduce greenhouse gases would lead to a re-optimization in the economy. For example, there would be fewer jobs at coal power plants, but more jobs in renewable energy. Whether net jobs increase or decrease depends very much on the “job intensity” of services provided in these sectors. Most estimates suggest that the job intensity is higher for renewables than for fossil fuel plants and fossil fuel extraction.

"New York Times series accurately describes research on Antarctic ice sheets and sea level rise, but highlights uncertain studies",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-series-accurately-describes-research-antarctic-ice-sheets-sea-level-rise-justin-gillis/,Antarctic Dispatches: Miles of ice collapsing into the sea / Racing to find answers in the ice,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/18/climate/antarctica-ice-melt-climate-change.html,"THE ACCELERATION is making some scientists fear that Antarctica’s ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration.

Because the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically, the continued existence of the world’s great coastal cities — Miami, New York, Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica’s fate.

Four New York Times journalists joined a Columbia University team in Antarctica late last year to fly across the world’s largest chunk of floating ice in an American military cargo plane loaded with the latest scientific gear.

Inside the cargo hold, an engineer with a shock of white hair directed younger scientists as they threw switches. Gravity meters jumped to life. Radar pulses and laser beams fired toward the ice below.

On computer screens inside the plane, in ghostly traces of data, the broad white surface of the Ross Ice Shelf began to yield the secrets hiding beneath.

“We are 9,000 miles from New York,” said the white-haired engineer, Nicholas Frearson of Columbia. “But we are connected by the ocean.”

A rapid disintegration of Antarctica might, in the worst case, cause the sea to rise so fast that tens of millions of coastal refugees would have to flee inland, potentially straining societies to the breaking point. Climate scientists used to regard that scenario as fit only for Hollywood disaster scripts. But these days, they cannot rule it out with any great confidence.

Yet as they try to determine how serious the situation is, the scientists confront a frustrating lack of information.

Recent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level, parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly, causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century. That is double the maximum increase that an international climate panel projected only four years ago.

But those computer forecasts were described as crude even by the researchers who created them. “We could be decades too fast, or decades too slow,” said one of them, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. “There are still some really big question marks about the trajectory of future climate around Antarctica.”

Alarmed by the warning signs that parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet are becoming unstable, American and British scientific agencies are joining forces to get better measurements in the main trouble spots. The effort could cost more than $25 million and might not produce clearer answers about the fate of the ice until the early 2020s.

For scientists working in Antarctica, the situation has become a race against time.

Even as the threat from global warming comes into sharper focus, these scientists understand that political leaders — and cities already feeling the effects of a rising sea — need clearer forecasts about the consequences of emissions. That urgent need for insight has led scientists from Columbia to spend the past two Antarctic summers flying over the Ross Ice Shelf, a floating chunk of ice larger than California.

The Ross shelf helps to slow the flow of land ice from Antarctica into the ocean. Compared with other parts of Antarctica, the shelf seems stable now, but computer forecasts suggest that it might be vulnerable to rapid collapse in the next few decades.

The project to map the structure and depth of the ice shelf in detail, funded by American taxpayers through the National Science Foundation, puts Columbia and its partner institutions on the front lines of one of the world’s most urgent scientific and political problems.

“Our goal is to understand how to predict what’s going to happen to the ice sheets,” said Robin E. Bell, the lead Columbia scientist in charge of the effort. “We really don’t know right now.”

Remote as Antarctica may seem, every person in the world who gets into a car, eats a steak or boards an airplane is contributing to the emissions that put the frozen continent at risk. If those emissions continue unchecked and the world is allowed to heat up enough, scientists have no doubt that large parts of Antarctica will melt into the sea.

But they do not know exactly what the trigger temperature might be, or whether the recent acceleration of the ice means that Earth has already reached it. The question confronting society, said Richard B. Alley, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, is easier to ask than to answer:

“How hot is too hot?”

Scientists who reviewed the article indicate that it is generally an accurate description of the state of research, which shows that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (which is especially vulnerable to warming) alone has the potential to raise global sea level by several meters over the long term. However, several complex statements could be improved with additional context or more precise wording to help readers avoid misconceptions. For example, the article relies heavily on recent results from one ice sheet modeling effort that simulates higher future rates of ice melt, while other model simulations contain important differences.

","Determining the rates, mechanisms, and geographic variability of sea-level change is vital to projecting future sea-level rise and managing coastal flood risks. Because the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have the largest potential to contribute to global mean sea-level rise under future warming, understanding their sensitivity to climate change is of particular importance.

",This article is well written and contains no logical fallacies. Some statements could be clarified/quantified a bit better.,"Lauren Simkins, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia","The Antarctic Ice Sheet has the potential to contribute significantly and rapidly to future sea-level rise. This article accurately and succinctly presents research on the processes and feedbacks that make the scientific community worried about the fate of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in a warming world.

","Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of Exeter","The majority of the article is informative and a fair reflection of an important area of scientific research. It is good to inform readers of this. However, in my view, the start and end of the article and the headline give undue prominence to an highly speculative aspect of the story, i.e., the question of whether major loss of ice from Antarctica has already become unavoidable. This distinction between future, avoidable, risks and existing, unstoppable impacts is absolutely key, and while the majority of the article makes this distinction well, the emphasis in the headline and the start and end of the article are opposite to that in the main body of the article.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,“The acceleration is making some scientists fear that Antarctica’s ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration.”,"This is all factually true. Indeed, there is worry that a climatically-initiated dynamic disintegration is currently underway. However, there is also large uncertainty around whether this is the case. So, I would tend to classify scientific confidence on whether current mass change trends represent (in part) a true dynamical disintegration process as “low”.

","This is true, but referring to West Antarctic ice sheet would be more precise.

","It is clear that ongoing warming of the climate will pose major risks to the stability of ice sheets. However, this statement seems to have moved the story up a notch from what is actually written later in the article. There are two aspects to this: (1) the size of the area of concern (the whole of Antarctica rather than just parts), and (2) whether irreversible loss has already begun, as opposed to being an imminent risk. The article describes legitimate concerns that parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are becoming vulnerable and hence may soon be at risk of starting an “unstoppable disintegration”, but the suggestion that this is actually already happening (and hence that major Antarctic ice loss is now avoidable) is far more speculative—as indeed the later parts of the article make clear. The phrase “entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration” is not the same as “becoming vulnerable to an unstoppable disintegration”, but the latter phrase would better represent what is said later in the article.",,"“Because the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically, the continued existence of the world’s great coastal cities — Miami, New York, Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica’s fate.”

","This is the prime motive of understanding Antarctic ice sheet dynamics, especially since the far-field location gives Antarctica relatively more weight to sea level rise along many Northern Hemisphere cities than Greenland.
","The vulnerable parts of the ice sheet are those that resting on beds that are below sea level; therefore, the ice itself is in contact with a warming ocean. The majority of the West Antarctic and ~30% of the East Antarctic sectors of the ice sheet are grounded below sea level.",,,"“Remote as Antarctica may seem, every person in the world who gets into a car, eats a steak or boards an airplane is contributing to the emissions that put the frozen continent at risk. If those emissions continue unchecked and the world is allowed to heat up enough, scientists have no doubt that large parts of Antarctica will melt into the sea.
But they do not know exactly what the trigger temperature might be, or whether the recent acceleration of the ice means that Earth has already reached it.”

","This is factually true. In principle, there should be threshold in cumulative carbon emissions, beyond which the Earth system is committed to various levels of Antarctic ice loss. These thresholds have been only preliminarily explored, and are still largely unknown. And given the relatively slow response time of the Antarctic ice sheet, we may have already passes some/all of them—meaning that recent observed Antarctic changes reflect, in part, the initiation of large-scale, possibly irreversible, ice loss.

",,,,"“But as the ice age ended and the oceans warmed, all of them collapsed.”

","“Collapse” is commonly taken to mean “fail suddenly and completely”, but in the context of ice sheets the scientific use of “collapse” can encompass much longer timescales (even multiple centuries) and it would be informative to make this clear. For example, IPCC AR5 WGI (Chapter 13 on sea level change) use it this way:

“Future climate forcing could trigger such an unstable collapse, which may then continue independently of climate. This potential collapse might unfold over centuries for individual bedrock troughs in West Antarctica and sectors of East Antarctica.”

Without this clarification, “collapse” may be misinterpreted to mean something happening over timescales of a single decade or much shorter timescales—especially when combined with earlier language about refugees “fleeing inland” due to a “rapid disintegration”.",,,,"“The warmer water seems to be doing the most damage to a series of glaciers that flow into a region of West Antarctica called the Amundsen Sea. Satellites have identified the most rapid loss of ice there, raising a critical question: Has an unstoppable collapse of the ice sheet already begun?”",This is factually correct: this is a question that the research community is currently working hard to answer.,,,,"“Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades.
The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.”","Although factually correct, the information provided is not sufficient to convey the relevance of sea level during this previous warm period (the previous interglacial) to the current global warming situation. It is not directly analogous because of differences in the Earth’s orbit and the long timescale during which the ice sheet melt was exposed to the warmer temperatures. IPCC AR5 WGI Summary for Policy Makers section B4 notes these two relevant issues: “This change in sea level occurred in the context of different orbital forcing and with high-latitude surface temperature, averaged over several thousand years, at least 2°C warmer than present”.

","This is factually correct. Indeed, past climate states analogous to the state which is expected to manifest in the near future, are characterized by much higher sea levels. This implies that the current Antarctic (and Greenland) ice sheet volumes are not consistent with warmer climate states. Rather, warmer climate states are consistent with smaller ice sheets.

“Relatively near future” is probably a misleading statement in the text, because it implies to average people a decadal timeframe—almost certainly unrealistic for 20-30 ft of sea level rise.

","Sea level and temperatures were higher in the previous interglacial, but the Earth climate system generally had a longer time frame to adjust to these conditions.

",,"“The Ross shelf helps to slow the flow of land ice from Antarctica into the ocean. Compared with other parts of Antarctica, the shelf seems stable now, but computer forecasts suggest that it might be vulnerable to rapid collapse in the next few decades.”","Using the geological record of Antarctic Ice Sheet behavior, the Ross Ice Shelf has collapsed in the past1, likely in response to ocean and atmosphere warming. Therefore, we know that the Ross Ice Shelf, which currently protects large portion of the Antarctic Ice Sheet2, is susceptible to collapse.

Fürst et al (2016) The safety band of Antarctic ice shelves, Nature Climate Change",,,,"“In the scientists’ worst-case computer simulations, continued global warming will cause the Ross Ice Shelf to weaken and collapse starting as early as the middle of this century.”","This collapse in the referenced work is initiated by strong surface melting causing ice shelf hydrofracture and then marine ice cliff instability. Other recent studies looking at the evolution of surface melt in Antarctica find far more modest (likely insignificant) increases in surface melt over this century, particularly over the Ross ice shelf.",,,,"“Right now, the shelf works like a giant bottle-stopper that slows down ice trying to flow from the land into the sea. If it collapses, the ice could flow into the ocean more rapidly, an effect that has already happened on a much smaller scale in other areas of Antarctica.
The most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet could raise the sea level by 10 to 15 feet, inundating many of the world’s coastal cities, though most scientists think that would take well over a century, or perhaps longer. They are worried about a possible rise of as much as six feet by the end of this century.”","This is correct but unclear. What is “perhaps longer” than “well over a century”? Given the importance of timescale for how coastal cities will respond to sea level rise, the range of possible timescales should be more explicit. IPCC AR5 WGI Chapter 13 on Sea Level Change assesses these as “sea level rise of 1 to 3 m per degree of warming is projected if the warming is sustained for several millennia (low confidence)”.

",,,"“But the story is not straightforward, and the warmer water attacking the ice has not been linked to global warming — at least not directly. The winds around the continent seem to be strengthening, stirring the ocean and bringing up a layer of warmer water that has most likely been there for centuries.
Are those stronger winds tied to human-caused global warming? Some scientists think so, but others say the case is unproven. “We’re not sure because we don’t have enough data, for long enough, to separate signal from noise,” said Eric J. Steig, a scientist at the University of Washington who has studied temperature trends in Antarctica.”

","This is factually correct, and an important point. In some climate analyses (such as global average air temperature), climate scientists and statisticians can (1) clearly detect a signal rising above the ‘background’ noise of natural climate variability and (2) clearly attribute this signal to human forcing (versus sun strength changes, volcanoes, cosmic rays, etc.). However, in the case of regional Antarctic climatology, this is not yet clearly the case. Particularly in the case of Antarctic oceanography, as Dr. Steig points out, this largely stems from lack of observations of sufficient length to allow for robust statistical detection/attribution of near-Antarctic ocean changes.",,,,"“Recent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level, parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly, causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century. That is double the maximum increase that an international climate panel projected only four years ago.
But those computer forecasts were described as crude even by the researchers who created them. ‘We could be decades too fast, or decades too slow,’said one of them, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ‘There are still some really big question marks about the trajectory of future climate around Antarctica.’”

","Process-based predictions of sea-level rise by the International climate panel (i.e., the IPCC) are limited by uncertainties surrounding the response of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets1, 2, 3, steric changes4, 5, contributions from mountain glaciers6, as well as from groundwater pumping for irrigation purposes and storage of water in reservoirs7, 8, 9. In large part because of the limitations of physical process models, IPCC AR5 does not offer “very likely” (5th to 95th percentile) sea-level projections, but concluded that “there is currently insufficient evidence to evaluate the probability of specific levels above the assessed likely range”10.

The contribution from Greenland (GrIS) and Antarctic (AIS) Ice Sheet mass loss has increased since the early 1990s, comprising ~19% of the total observed rise in GMSL between 1993 and 2010 and ~40% of the total observed rise in GMSL between 2003 and 200811, 12. GrIS and AIS contributions are projected to become increasingly important over the 21st century10 and dominate sea-level rise uncertainty in the second half of the 21st century13, 14.

","I think this statement is also factually true. Indeed, recent simulations suggest that sea level rise from Antarctica could be very large. However, as is implied by the word “crude”, these state-of-the-art simulations are still lacking in important physical processes which are very difficult to implement at sufficient resolution in computer models of both the Antarctic Ice Sheet and near-Antarctic climate. So, due to these deficiencies, frankly there is still very large uncertainty regarding upcoming Antarctic change, at least as simulated by computer models. However, paleoclimate proxies have the ability to provide additional critical non-model-based constraints.

","The “recent computer forecasts” referenced here likely refer to the numerical model developed by Rob DeConto1. Different from other ice-sheet models it includes the so-called “Marine Ice Cliff Instability”, which at present is not widely accepted in the ice-sheet modeling community. Including this instability will cause increased rates for resultant sea-level rise projections. On the other hand, DeConto’s model includes simplifications related to how ice sheet slides over the sediment at the base. This ice-sliding parameterization will generally increase ice-sheet stability and cause smaller projections of sea-level rise, as demonstrated in the Nature paper by C. Ritz et al. in 20152.

There is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the physical and hydrological processes involved in ice-sheet modeling. Ideally, we prepare for the upper bounds regarding projected rates in sea-level rise, since the scientific community is still far from providing high-confidence estimates.

","This is based on a combination of observations and modelling1. Observations show us several glaciers are in decline2 and ice shelves, which serve as a buttress for the glaciers, are thinning due to warmer sea water. This process is seen to be accelerating3. Where ice shelves (like Larsen B) have already vanished, glaciers in the hinterland have indeed sped up4. Numerical models predict that the changes underway now are likely to lead to a full-scale collapse of the west Antarctic Ice Sheet.

","“Incorporating recent advances in the understanding of how ice sheets might break apart, they found that both West Antarctica and some vulnerable parts of East Antarctica would go into an unstoppable collapse if the Earth continued to warm at a rapid pace.
In their worst-case scenario, the sea level could rise by six feet by the end of this century, and the pace could pick up drastically in the 22nd century. Dr. DeConto and Dr. Pollard do not claim that this is a certainty — they acknowledge that their analysis is still rough — but they argue that the possibility should be taken seriously.”","This is factually true. I think the text is accurate in reflecting the distinct possibility of “upper-bound” Antarctic behaviour. However, note that the current “worst-case” scenario estimate is not the same as the current “most-likely” scenario estimate (in any risk assessment exercise).

","Related to my earlier comment, the relevance of the “Marine Ice Cliff Instability” is still very unclear, and not generally accepted in the ice-sheet modeling community. DeConto and Pollard’s sea-level estimates certainly fall in the high end of sea-level rise projections. However, other processes such as non-linearities in melt or basal sliding may provide similar high-end estimates.",,,"“But some research suggests that a catastrophe might not yet be inevitable. In a study last year, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University used their computer model to predict what would happen if emissions were reduced sharply over the next few decades, in line with international climate goals.
Under the most ambitious scenarios, they found a strong likelihood that Antarctica would remain fairly stable.”

","To my mind, the way this is written gives the impression that the DeConto and Pollard study is the outlier and that a substantial body of research suggest that a catastrophe is already inevitable—however, the article has not actually given any details of any such research, it only raised the possibility of unstoppable disintegration as a research question. It would be far more accurate to say that the vast majority of research does not suggest that a catastrophe is inevitable.

ThinkProgress story on thawing Alaskan tundra generally accurate but somewhat misleading,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/alaskas-vicious-cycle-warming-tundra-spews-co2-speeding-up-warming-joe-romm-think-progress/,"The ‘ancient carbon’ of Alaska’s tundras is being released, starting a vicious warming cycle",https://thinkprogress.org/alaskas-vicious-cycle-warming-tundra-spews-co2-speeding-up-warming-8cf7aec95fc7,"The Alaskan tundra is warming so quickly it has become a net emitter of carbon dioxide ahead of schedule, a new study finds.

Since CO2 is the primary heat-trapping greenhouse gas — and since the permafrost contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere does today — this means a vicious cycle has begun that will speed up global warming.

“Because it’s getting warmer, there’s more CO2 coming out which means it’s going to get warmer which means there’s more CO2 coming out,” explained Harvard researcher and lead author Roisin Commane. Dr. Commane told ThinkProgress that “warming soils will emit more CO2 and this will overwhelm any CO2 uptake” due to an increase in plantlife from “CO2 fertilization and warmer temperatures.”’

The study is the first to report that a major portion of the Arctic is a net source of heat-trapping emissions. As a result, Commane warns that our current climate models need to be updated: “We’re seeing this much earlier than we thought we would see it.”

“We find that Alaska, overall, was a net source of carbon to the atmosphere during 2012–2014,” the study concludes. Data from NOAA’s Barrow Alaska station “indicate that October through December emissions of CO2 from surrounding tundra increased by 73 percent since 1975, supporting the view that rising temperatures have made Arctic ecosystems a net source of CO2.”

The permafrost, or tundra, has been a very large carbon freezer. For a very long time, it has had a very low decomposition rate for the carbon-rich plant matter. But we’ve been leaving the freezer door wide open and are witnessing the permafrost being transformed from a long-term carbon locker to a short-term carbon un-locker.

“This is ancient carbon,” Dr. Commane told Alaska public radio. “The carbon that’s locked in the permafrost in the Arctic is thousands and millions of years old.”

Thawing permafrost can release not just CO2, but also methane, a much stronger heat-trapping gas.

While most models that include thawing permafrost look at CO2, Russian scientists have recently discovered some 7,000 underground bubbles of permafrost-related methane in Siberia. Since methane traps heat 86 times more effectively than CO2 over a 20-year span, these findings suggest that the effect of the thawing permafrost is even greater than first thought.

Also, a 2008 study, “Accelerated Arctic land warming and permafrost degradation during rapid sea ice loss,” found that rapid sea ice loss — as has been experienced since the study was published — could triple the rate of Arctic warming.

Meanwhile, the rapid Arctic warming that is fueling these emissions continues. On Monday, NASA reported that April 2017 was the second-hottest April on record — only April 2016 was hotter. As the map above shows, Arctic temperatures were blistering, up to 13.5°F (7.5°C) above the 1951–1980 average.

The longer we delay aggressive climate action, the harder it will be to stuff all the toothpaste back into the tube, and the more catastrophic climate impacts we will face.

This post has been updated for clarity. Dr. Commane reached out to ThinkProgress to make clear that this process would not lead to a runaway greenhouse effect, but would exceed any increase in CO2 uptake from the increase in plant matter expected in the region due to climate change.",neutral,Accurate,135,"This article at ThinkProgress by Joe Romm describes a study of carbon dioxide released from warming Alaskan tundra in recent years. While the article correctly notes the study’s conclusions, it also includes some language that is imprecise or extends beyond the contents of the study.

Scientists who reviewed the story found that the article’s headline, in particular, carries a tone that exaggerates the study’s conclusions. One of the study’s authors also clarified that a personal quote used in the story (taken from a radio interview) requires context for clarity.

","The writing is a bit over the top, but factually correct in general. The main weakness is in linking the solidly evidence-based observed changes from the Commane et al paper with much more speculative links such as the Siberian methane bubbles.","Pierre Friedlingstein, Professor, University of Exeter
","The article departs significantly from the PNAS study it aims to cover. It’s catastrophic tone is not really supported by the study.
","David Archer, Professor, University of Chicago
","It’s true that Arctic permafrost contains lots of carbon and that this is vulnerable to decomposition in the coming few centuries. My only caveat to the reader would be that the amount of methane from the Arctic, and even the amount of CO2, are today much smaller than anthropogenic sources of those gases. The largest source of methane in the Arctic is the fossil fuel industry, but we never hear that.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“The ‘ancient carbon’ of Alaska’s tundras is being released, starting a vicious warming cycle
‘This is ancient carbon, thousands and millions of years old.’ It’s being released ‘much earlier than we thought.”

","This is an interesting headline and quote. The article in PNAS uses atmospheric measurements of CO2 to derive sources and sinks from tundra and boreal forests. The study does not say that “this is ancient carbon, thousands and millions year old”… It could be, but there is no evidence for this in the paper. The paper only shows that atmospheric measurements indicate that Alaskan ecosystems have been a source of carbon in recent years (2012 to 2014).

","Most of the carbon in the permafrost pool is thousands to tens of thousands year old at the oldest, rather than millions.",,,"“The Alaskan tundra is warming so quickly it has become a net emitter of carbon dioxide ahead of schedule, a new study finds”","The study doesn’t really say that. The PNAS study itself focused on 3 years (2012-2014) for which aircraft measurements were taken from April to November, and finds that Alaskan tundra was a source of carbon for 2 of these 3 years (2012 is a small sink). Then these flux estimates are compared to  data from CMIP5 models for those particular years. However,  the PNAS paper does not assess when these CMIP5 models become sources of CO2. One would need to see long time series of the CMIP5 models, along with longer time series of aircraft measurements and inferred carbon fluxes to estimate when each turn from sink to sources.",,,,"Because it’s getting warmer, there’s more CO2 coming out which means it’s going to get warmer which means there’s more CO2 coming out[…] And it will just run away with itself.”

","This is a simplistic description of a positive feedback. Yes, warming would lead to release of carbon from soils and permafrost, and this would lead to more warming, hence more carbon loss. But in no way would this lead to a runaway feedback. Say a warming of 1°C led to a release of carbon from soils that induces an additional warming of 0.1°C (that’s quite a large positive feedback: 10% of the initial perturbation). This additional 0.1°C would lead to an additional release of carbon, inducing an additional warming of 0.01°C, which will lead to more carbon released and an additional 0.001°C warming, etc… Ultimately, warming will be 1.111…°C—larger than the initial warming of 1°C but quite far from a runaway scenario.

","(Dr Commane is the first author of the scientific study discussed in the ThinkProgress article)
I spoke with Henry Fountain (New York Times), Chris Mooney (Washington Post), Oli Milman (Guardian), and Bob Berwyn (Inside Climate News) about the PNAS paper and I think they all did a great job condensing my attempts at communicating the message of the paper. The radio chat I did with a local NPR station in Juneau, AK (which I think is the source of this article) was probably the least comprehensive attempt—I tried to make things as simple as possible and didn’t realize that the quote would sound so off when taken outside of that context. I think the written articles better conveyed the essence of the paper compared to what I tried to say in the radio piece.",,,"“Melting permafrost can release not just CO2, but also methane, a much stronger heat-trapping gas.”

For former president Barack Obama, the ever-changing and often contradictory ""facts"" about global warming (which liberals now call climate change because the globe stopped warming) was simply ""settled science.""

But now it turns out the Arctic sea ice is thicker than ever and, oh yeah, the global temperature trend has not warmed for 19 years. That's right -- 19 years!

The Telegraph newspaper in the UK has published a fascinating article detailing data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI). 

Ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C. In April the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April 13 years ago. Furthermore, whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two metres thick. The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years.

As for those record temperatures brought in 2016 by an exceptionally strong El Niño, the satellites now show that in recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more that 0.6 degrees: just as happened 17 years ago after a similarly strong El Niño had also made 1998 the “hottest year on record”.

This means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for 19 years. But the BBC won’t be telling us any of this. And we are still stuck with that insanely damaging Climate Change Act, which in this election will scarcely get a mention.

​The author then goes on to decry the very real consequences to businesses and citizens from governments continuing to enact ever more stringent regulation to offset this global ""warming."" But the real findings of the DMI are significant. The liberal media might take issue with a U.S. think tank funding a study that says global warming doesn't exist -- or at least hasn't for 19 years -- but they'll accept the findings from little ol' Denmark, won't they?

But wait, there's more -- much more. 

""Experts told Daily Star Online planet Earth is on course for a “Little Age Ice” within the next three years thanks to a cocktail of climate change and low solar activity,"" the Brit paper writes on Monday. 

Research shows a natural cooling cycle that occurs every 230 years began in 2014 and will send temperatures plummeting even further by 2019.

Scientists are also expecting a “huge reduction” in solar activity for 33 years between 2020 and 2053 that will cause thermometers to crash.

Both cycles suggest Earth is entering a global cooling cycle that could have devastating consequences for global economy, human life and society as we know it.

If predictions of the world-wide big freeze come true, the plot to 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow would not be far from reality during winter. ...

David Dilley, CEO of Global Weather Oscillations, told Daily Star Online global warming and cooling cycles are determined by the gravitational forces of the Earth, moon and sun.

Each cycle lasts around 120,000 years, with sub-cycles of around 230 years.

He said: “We have had five warming cycles since about 900AD, each followed by a dramatic cooling cycle.

“The last global warming cycle ended in 1790 and the year 2020 is 230 following this – thus I have been talking about rapid cooling beginning in 2019.”

He said the oncoming cooling will send temperatures plummeting to lows last seen in the 1940s – when the mercury bottomed out at -21C during winter in the UK.

He said: “Cooling from 2019 into about 2020 to 2021 will bring world temperatures back to where they were in the 1940s through the 1960s.

By the way, the headline of the Telegraph article was perfect: ""Another Arctic ice panic over as world temperatures plummet."" Exactly. Watch the MSM networks and websites for these latest reports -- and then ponder why they never ran them ....",very_low,"Biased, Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Inappropriate sources, Misleading",267,"The title of this Daily Wire article inaccurately claims that global temperature has not warmed over the past 19 years—in direct contradiction with observations—and the article provides no evidence in support of this bold claim.

The article relies, for its first section, on a Telegraph article (analyzed separately here) that is flawed and itself based on claims from a blog post referring to data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI). But DMI scientists explain that the article “fundamentally misrepresents both our research and the operational data products we provide”.

The second section quotes an article in the UK tabloid Daily Star. It claims that an imminent ice age is coming, based on a misrepresentation of the Sun’s influence on the climate that we have already covered in an earlier Climate Feedback review:

In that review, Prof. Michael Lockwood explained, “The whole argument rests on the incorrect myth that the Maunder minimum caused a ‘mini ice age’ and uses that name to draw specious implications and conclusions.” Georg Feulner also noted that “the scientists mentioned in the article have not predicted a ‘mini ice-age’, but an extended period of low solar activity similar to the 17th-century Maunder Minimum. The Maunder Minimum falls into a more extended period of somewhat cooler climate conditions termed the ‘Little Ice Age’ (although this was no true ‘ice age’). It has thus become rather fashionable to claim that the ‘Little Ice Age’ was caused by low solar activity, but this is not what the science says.”

In no point along this production line of mistruths was anything like a peer reviewed study involved.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,“ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C”,"It is indeed true that the Arctic is cold in winter—it’s hard to argue with that. But this statement belies the fact that winter 2017 was actually extraordinarily warm by historical standards, and second only to the record-shattering warmth observed just last year (in 2016). The attached plot, created by Zachary Labe and available at http://sites.uci.edu/zlabe/arctic-temperatures, shows that the -20 °C temperatures this winter are nearly 10 °C degrees above the long-term average of -30 °C! Therefore, the fact that temperatures were -20 °C this winter in the Arctic is actually a testament to just how much the Arctic has warmed in recent years.","This statement is both wrong and misleading.
Firstly, most of the Arctic has in fact been consistently warmer than -20 °C this winter. For the period 1 December 2016 to 20 April 2017, the average temperature was above -20 °C everywhere in the central Arctic except north of Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago. Over the Greenland Ice Sheet and in Eastern Siberia (and only there), the temperature was below -25 °C.
Secondly, it should not be a surprise that the Arctic is very cold in winter (a period with little to no sunlight). It is much fairer to consider the difference between this winter and the average winter temperatures. Compared to our baseline of 2004-2013 everywhere in the Arctic region was at least 4 °C warmer than the average of 2004-2013 (in itself a warmer baseline period than the 1958-2002 baseline used elsewhere). Around Svalbard, it was about 4.5 °C warmer than average and in Northern Greenland, including Kap Morris Jesup, the world’s northernmost weather station (where a record +3 °C temperature was recorded on one day in February), Ellesmere Island in northeastern Canada, and large parts of eastern Siberia this winter were more than 5 °C warmer than the average as you can see below:
Figure: Left, Average temperature over the Arctic for the period December 2016 to April 2017; Right, Deviation of temperature for the period December 2016 to April 2017 from the average 2004-2013.This makes the winter 2016/2017 the second warmest on record in the Arctic (after winter 2015-16), according to the European Copernicus climate service.
",,,“record temperatures brought in 2016 by an exceptionally strong El Niño”,"Last year the annual global temperature was about 1.1 °C above a late-19th century baseline but only about 0.1°C of this was due to the El Niño—the other 1 °C is due to human influences.

So while the record occurred in 2016 due to El Niño, most of the anomaly was due to climate change.",,,,"“the satellites now show that in recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more that [sic] 0.6 degrees”

","El Niño events do indeed elevate global temperatures temporarily, and this is partly why global temperatures in 2016 were so extreme. But as the attached plot from NASA GISS shows, temperatures so far in 2017 have still been extraordinarily warm in a historical context, and in fact would have been record-breaking if not for the large temperature spike that occurred in 2016. In any case, it is not scientifically meaningful to measure global temperature “trends” over a two year period; the large and statistically significant long-term warming signal overwhelms short-term variations on multi-decadal timescales.

","While true (and not necessarily in agreement with the more robust thermometer records for this period, this has no bearing on the long-term climate trend, which is driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases. It is misleading and a logical fallacy to claim this says anything about climate change, which is the long-term change in temperatures.

","While temperatures have declined modestly from the peak of the El Niño event, this is expected behavior, particularly in satellite records where El Niño is amplified. However, temperatures in January through April are quite above average to-date, and while we may not set a record temperature in 2017 compared to 2016, it will very likely be the second warmest year on record (at least on the surface).

Through present there is no sign of any sort of pause or slowdown in any of the surface records or one of the two satellite records (the RSS groups latest version 4 record). The only record showing a continued pause is the one produced by the University of Alabama, Huntsville (the UAH record).

The differences between these records and their causes is an area of active research, though we have strong reason to suspect that the surface record is quite accurate.

",,"“This means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for 19 years”

","This is both cherry-picking of the data (starting with 1998), and not correct anyway.

","This is blatantly false. Examine the trend here:

Furthermore, a short time period of a few months in 2017 cannot say anything whatsoever about the long-term change in climate.

",This statement is false. Global temperatures continue their long-term warming trend.,,"“Arctic sea ice is thicker than ever”

","PIOMAS (a model constrained by surface temp observations) shows the ice volume tracking lower than ever for this time of the year. Most recent direct observations show the sea ice is still a lot thinner than it was in previous decades.

","This is wrong. Arctic sea-ice thickness in 2017 is actually at its lowest values compared to earlier years for which we have sufficient data coverage, see:

",,,“In April the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April 13 years ago”,"In the NSIDC dataset, April 2017 was actually the equal of the lowest Northern Hemisphere extent on record (tied with 2016 on 13.83 M km2).

","This statement is misleading. Arctic sea ice extent in April was significantly lower than the long-term average—but varies substantially from day to day and year to year as processes such as wind and waves and short-term weather variability have a substantial effect on sea ice extent, particularly at this time of year. However, over the long term since 1979, the April sea ice extent has declined by around 3% per decade, at other times of the year the decline is even more marked. This is an example of cherry-picking dates in order to try and state that the sea ice is recovering (it’s not). It also confuses climate variability with trends over short periods.",,,"“Furthermore, whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two metres thick.”

","Arctic sea ice volume has actually exhibited record thinness so far during 2017—beating the previous record years of 2012/2016 by a wide margin. Another nice visualization by Zachary Labe illustrates this quite clearly:

",,,,"“Whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two metres thick.”","This is a misleading statement, as “extremely thin” is not defined and what is also not stated is that there were also substantial areas of much thicker ice in 2008. If we look at the total ice volume, which averages these effects out, on 1st May 2017 it was about 6% lower than the ice volume for the same date in 2008 according to the operational ocean and sea ice model. Again, in addition to air and ocean temperature, ice thickness depends on winds and ocean currents and shows large variations from year to year so choosing two years arbitrarily is misleading without considering the long term trend.

",,,,"“The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years.”

","This is not per se completely incorrect, but the author does not tell us the whole story. The author refers to the growing of the ice sheet volume through snowfall throughout winter. The snow accumulated on Greenland in past winter (September-April) has indeed been remarkably high:

However, this does not imply that the volume of the ice sheet is increasing, because (1) the ice sheet also loses ice through discharging icebergs; it is the difference between snowfall-driven growth and solid ice discharge that determines if the ice sheet gains or loses volume, and (2) the snow that accumulated during the winter will (at least partly) melt over the summer. That’s why we analyse changes to the ice sheet volume/mass on (at least) annual time scales. Only after the summer we will know how much of the accumulated snow has (not) been melted.

uring the past years, the amount of melting has been record-high, and much of snow that accumulated over the winter melted and ran off into the ocean. Concurrently, ice discharge continued, so the Greenland ice sheet LOST considerable volume. We will know in September how much the ice sheet has changed volume this year.

Two additional remarks:

(a) The word “faster” should not have been used here. We are not talking about the rate of speed, but rather about the total change in volume. Also, it is easier to talk about “mass changes” than “volume changes” since the former is not sensitive to the density of the medium we are talking about (snow has a lower density than ice!).

(b) The enhanced snowfall, ironically, is most probably also a signal of the strongly warming Arctic: as the atmosphere warms, it contains more moisture, and generates more precipitation. Also, record-low fall and winter sea ice extent led to large streaks of open water that might have contributed to additional moisture loading of the air.","Here the author confuses short-term variability (i.e., weather) with a significant change to the Greenland ice sheet. Until a full annual cycle is considered, it is impossible to say if the volume is increasing or not. We can confirm that there has been a record amount of snow and rain over Greenland this winter, most of it fell in October due to extra-tropical hurricane Nicole. However this “extra” winter snowfall is not yet part of the Greenland ice sheet but a snow layer sitting on top of it and the extra gain in snow may be easily wiped out by a warm sunny summer. The summer is by far the most important time of year for the ice sheet—it determines if the ice sheet will grow or shrink so we will not know until September if this winter’s extra snow will have any effect on the overall ice sheet mass budget. Furthermore, we should bear in mind that extra snowfall in Greenland is actually predicted in most climate models, (a warmer atmosphere = more moisture = more snowfall in Greenland) as a consequence of climate change. We should also note that almost all of the additional above average snow fell in the East and South, and north-western Greenland actually has less snow than usual (which you can see in the figure above).",,,"“Scientists are also expecting a ‘huge reduction’ in solar activity for 33 years between 2020 and 2053 that will cause thermometers to crash.”

","Solar activity cannot be predicted. While there are some indicators that future solar activity might indeed be lower, this will have little effect on global temperatures. See, for example, this RealClimate post based on Feulner and Rahmstorf (2010)*.

The results have been confirmed by a number of follow-up studies.

Feulner and Rahmstorf (2010) On the effect of a new grand minimum of solar activity on the future climate on Earth, Geophysical Research Letters

Only a few years ago, the scientists were surprised by the recent reduction in the current activity.",,,"“He said: ‘We have had five warming cycles since about 900AD, each followed by a dramatic cooling cycle.’”

","The global (or even hemispheric) temperature drops during past grand solar minima were actually small. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that slightly cooler episodes like the “Little Ice Age” were predominantly caused by volcanic eruptions.

Sure enough, before Christmas, a report from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was greeted with such headlines as “Hottest Arctic on record triggers massive ice melt”. In March we had the BBC trumpeting another study that blamed vanishing Arctic ice as the cause of weather which led to the worst-ever smog in Beijing, warning that it “could even threaten the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022”.

But last week we were brought back to earth by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), as charted by our friend Paul Homewood on his blog Notalotofpeopleknowthat, with the news that ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C. In April the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April 13 years ago. Furthermore, whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two metres thick. The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years.

As for those record temperatures brought in 2016 by an exceptionally strong El Niño, the satellites now show that in recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more that 0.6 degrees: just as happened 17 years ago after a similarly strong El Niño had also made 1998 the “hottest year on record”.

I leave it to others to speculate on whether, in Theresa May’s Downing Street outburst against Brussels she was “speaking for England”, or had gone off her head. But one leaked detail of her dinner the previous week with Jean‑Claude Juncker and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is worth dwelling on.

To remind Mrs May of just what she and the EU are up against in the next 18 months, Juncker was said to have plonked on the table two documents, the EU’s trade deal with Canada and the EU’s accession treaty with Croatia in 2011.

Both are very relevant to our concerns, because Mrs May not only hopes to negotiate an unprecedented trade deal: at the end of the negotiations, there will also have to be a secession treaty, covering much of the same ground as an accession treaty, but in reverse.

The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), which gave Canada much less access to the European market than we enjoy now, is incredibly complex, covered 1,598 pages and took seven years to negotiate. The Croatia treaty, like any accession treaty, had to cover 35 “chapters” or policy areas, only six of which refer to trade; and was again extremely complex, filling 124 pages, which took six years to agree.

Juncker seemingly invited Mrs May to read these documents, because they each conveyed the awesome scale of the ground her negotiations will have to cover in just 18 months. At every stage, Mr Barnier’s team will have to refer back to each of the 27 countries he is representing, each of which will then have to ratify what is agreed, with the power of veto if they don’t like it.

Just leafing through those documents is a sobering corrective to any hubristic optimism about what we are taking on.",very_low,"Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",432,"The Telegraph published a brief article by Christopher Booker discussing recent Arctic temperatures and sea ice cover in the context of climate change.

The scientists who have reviewed the article indicate that its claims are misleading or inaccurate. For instance, the article emphasizes that global average temperature has decreased since the end of the 2016 El Niño event, which was expected, but fails to note that this recent decrease by no means reverses the long-term increase in temperature. It also inaccurately claims that global temperature has not warmed over the past 19 years—in direct contradiction with observations. The author claims that last winter in the Arctic was “cold” (-20°C), but fails to recognize that this temperature is much warmer than the norm for the Arctic (by about 5°C), making it the second warmest winter on record.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C”

","It is indeed true that the Arctic is cold in winter—it’s hard to argue with that. But this statement belies the fact that winter 2017 was actually extraordinarily warm by historical standards, and second only to the record-shattering warmth observed just last year (in 2016). The attached plot, created by Zachary Labe and available at http://sites.uci.edu/zlabe/arctic-temperatures, shows that the -20 °C temperatures this winter are nearly 10 °C degrees above the long-term average of -30 °C! Therefore, the fact that temperatures were -20 °C this winter in the Arctic is actually a testament to just how much the Arctic has warmed in recent years.

","(with contributions from Mads Ribergaard and Gorm Dybkjær)
This statement is both wrong and misleading.
Firstly, most of the Arctic has in fact been consistently warmer than -20 °C this winter. For the period 1 December 2016 to 20 April 2017, the average temperature was above -20 °C everywhere in the central Arctic except north of Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago. Over the Greenland Ice Sheet and in Eastern Siberia (and only there), the temperature was below -25 °C.
Secondly, it should not be a surprise that the Arctic is very cold in winter (a period with little to no sunlight). It is much fairer to consider the difference between this winter and the average winter temperatures. Compared to our baseline of 2004-2013 everywhere in the Arctic region was at least 4 °C warmer than the average of 2004-2013 (in itself a warmer baseline period than the 1958-2002 baseline used elsewhere). Around Svalbard, it was about 4.5 °C warmer than average and in Northern Greenland, including Kap Morris Jesup, the world’s northernmost weather station (where a record +3 °C temperature was recorded on one day in February), Ellesmere Island in northeastern Canada, and large parts of eastern Siberia this winter were more than 5 °C warmer than the average as you can see below:

temperature over the Arctic for the period December 2016 to April 2017; Right, Deviation of temperature for the period December 2016 to April 2017 from the average 2004-2013.This makes the winter 2016/2017 the second warmest on record in the Arctic (after winter 2015-16), according to the European Copernicus climate service.",,,"“record temperatures brought in 2016 by an exceptionally strong El Niño”

","Last year the annual global temperature was about 1.1 °C above a late-19th century baseline but only about 0.1°C of this was due to the El Niño—the other 1 °C is due to human influences.

So while the record occurred in 2016 due to El Niño, most of the anomaly was due to climate change.
",,,,"“the satellites now show that in recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more that [sic] 0.6 degrees”

","El Niño events do indeed elevate global temperatures temporarily, and this is partly why global temperatures in 2016 were so extreme. But as the attached plot from NASA GISS shows, temperatures so far in 2017 have still been extraordinarily warm in a historical context, and in fact would have been record-breaking if not for the large temperature spike that occurred in 2016. In any case, it is not scientifically meaningful to measure global temperature “trends” over a two year period; the large and statistically significant long-term warming signal overwhelms short-term variations on multi-decadal timescales.

","While true (and not necessarily in agreement with the more robust thermometer records for this period, this has no bearing on the long-term climate trend, which is driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases. It is misleading and a logical fallacy to claim this says anything about climate change, which is the long-term change in temperatures.

","While temperatures have declined modestly from the peak of the El Niño event, this is expected behavior, particularly in satellite records where El Niño is amplified. However, temperatures in January through April are quite above average to-date, and while we may not set a record temperature in 2017 compared to 2016, it will very likely be the second warmest year on record (at least on the surface).

Through present there is no sign of any sort of pause or slowdown in any of the surface records or one of the two satellite records (the RSS groups latest version 4 record). The only record showing a continued pause is the one produced by the University of Alabama, Huntsville (the UAH record).

The differences between these records and their causes is an area of active research, though we have strong reason to suspect that the surface record is quite accurate.

Furthermore, a short time period of a few months in 2017 cannot say anything whatsoever about the long-term change in climate.

",This statement is false. Global temperatures continue their long-term warming trend.,,"“In April the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April 13 years ago”

","In the NSIDC dataset, April 2017 was actually the equal of the lowest Northern Hemisphere extent on record (tied with 2016 on 13.83 M km2).

","This statement is misleading. Arctic sea ice extent in April was significantly lower than the long-term average—but varies substantially from day to day and year to year as processes such as wind and waves and short-term weather variability have a substantial effect on sea ice extent, particularly at this time of year. However, over the long term since 1979, the April sea ice extent has declined by around 3% per decade, at other times of the year the decline is even more marked. This is an example of cherry-picking dates in order to try and state that the sea ice is recovering (it’s not). It also confuses climate variability with trends over short periods.",,,"“Furthermore, whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two metres thick.”

","Arctic sea ice volume has actually exhibited record thinness so far during 2017—beating the previous record years of 2012/2016 by a wide margin. Another nice visualization by Zachary Labe illustrates this quite clearly:

",,,,"“Whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two metres thick.”","This is a misleading statement, as “extremely thin” is not defined and what is also not stated is that there were also substantial areas of much thicker ice in 2008. If we look at the total ice volume, which averages these effects out, on 1st May 2017 it was about 6% lower than the ice volume for the same date in 2008 according to the operational ocean and sea ice model. Again, in addition to air and ocean temperature, ice thickness depends on winds and ocean currents and shows large variations from year to year so choosing two years arbitrarily is misleading without considering the long term trend.

",,,,“The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years.”,"This is not per se completely incorrect, but the author does not tell us the whole story. The author refers to the growing of the ice sheet volume through snowfall throughout winter. The snow accumulated on Greenland in past winter (September-April) has indeed been remarkably high:

However, this does not imply that the volume of the ice sheet is increasing, because (1) the ice sheet also loses ice through discharging icebergs; it is the difference between snowfall-driven growth and solid ice discharge that determines if the ice sheet gains or loses volume, and (2) the snow that accumulated during the winter will (at least partly) melt over the summer. That’s why we analyse changes to the ice sheet volume/mass on (at least) annual time scales. Only after the summer we will know how much of the accumulated snow has (not) been melted.

uring the past years, the amount of melting has been record-high, and much of snow that accumulated over the winter melted and ran off into the ocean. Concurrently, ice discharge continued, so the Greenland ice sheet LOST considerable volume. We will know in September how much the ice sheet has changed volume this year.

Two additional remarks:

(a) The word “faster” should not have been used here. We are not talking about the rate of speed, but rather about the total change in volume. Also, it is easier to talk about “mass changes” than “volume changes” since the former is not sensitive to the density of the medium we are talking about (snow has a lower density than ice!).

(b) The enhanced snowfall, ironically, is most probably also a signal of the strongly warming Arctic: as the atmosphere warms, it contains more moisture, and generates more precipitation. Also, record-low fall and winter sea ice extent led to large streaks of open water that might have contributed to additional moisture loading of the air.

","Here the author confuses short-term variability (i.e., weather) with a significant change to the Greenland ice sheet. Until a full annual cycle is considered, it is impossible to say if the volume is increasing or not. We can confirm that there has been a record amount of snow and rain over Greenland this winter, most of it fell in October due to extra-tropical hurricane Nicole. However this “extra” winter snowfall is not yet part of the Greenland ice sheet but a snow layer sitting on top of it and the extra gain in snow may be easily wiped out by a warm sunny summer. The summer is by far the most important time of year for the ice sheet—it determines if the ice sheet will grow or shrink so we will not know until September if this winter’s extra snow will have any effect on the overall ice sheet mass budget. Furthermore, we should bear in mind that extra snowfall in Greenland is actually predicted in most climate models, (a warmer atmosphere = more moisture = more snowfall in Greenland) as a consequence of climate change. We should also note that almost all of the additional above average snow fell in the East and South, and north-western Greenland actually has less snow than usual (which you can see in the figure above).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Insightful Bloomberg coverage on the rapidly changing Arctic: sea ice melt and permafrost thawing
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/bloomberg-accurately-describes-rapidly-changing-arctic-eric-roston-blacki-migliozzi/,How a Melting Arctic Changes Everything,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-arctic/,"Eight countries control land in the Arctic Circle. Five have coastlines to defend. The temperature is rising. The ice is melting. The race for newly accessible resources is beginning. And Russia is gaining ground.
The story of the Arctic begins with temperature but it’s so much more—this is a tale about oil and economics, about humanity and science, about politics and borders and the emerging risk of an emboldened and growing Russian empire.

The world as a whole has warmed about 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1880. Arctic temperatures have risen twice that amount during the same time period. The most recent year analyzed, October 2015 to September 2016, was 3.5C warmer than the early 1900s, according to the 2016 Arctic Report Card. Northern Canada, Svalbard, Norway and Russia’s Kara Sea reached an astounding 14C (25F) higher than normal last fall.

Scientists refer to these dramatic physical changes as “Arctic amplification,” or positive feedback loops. It’s a little bit like compound interest. A small change snowballs, and Arctic conditions become much less Arctic, much more quickly.

“After studying the Arctic and its climate for three-and-a-half decades,” Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data center, wrote recently. “I have concluded that what has happened over the last year goes beyond even the extreme.”

The heat is making quick work of its natural prey: ice.

Scientists track the number of “freezing-degree days,” a running seasonal tally of the amount of time it’s been cold enough for water to freeze. The 2016-2017 winter season has seen a dramatic shortfall in coldness—more than 20 percent below the average, a record.

Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated. Last month set a new low for March, out-melting 2015 by 23,000 square miles.

Compared with the 1981-2010 baseline, the average September sea-ice minimum has been dropping by more than 13 percent per decade. A recent study in Nature Climate Change estimated that from 30-50 percent of sea ice loss is due to climate variability, while the rest occurs because of human activity.

Receding ice decreases the Earth’s overall reflectivity, making the Arctic darker and therefore absorbing even more heat.

The ice is not all the same age or thickness, although it has become somewhat more uniform. In 1985, about 45 percent of Arctic sea ice was made up of older and thicker multi-year ice. By 2016, that number shrank to 22 percent.

With a greater percentage of seasonal ice, which disappears each Arctic summer, nations of the north have more time and opportunity to explore the resources beneath and within their territorial waters.

The sea-ice loss is President Vladimir Putin’s gain. Already the largest country on the planet, Russia stands to gain access to shipping routes and energy reserves, and a strategic military advantage from the opening of the Arctic.

Along the Russian coastline, which makes up more than half the Arctic total, winds and currents push old ice away from potential shipping lanes and prevent the build-up of thicker, multi-year ice that would leave other parts of the Arctic impassable for longer periods. That dynamic helps bring the Northern Sea Route—shippers’ hoped-for Russian express between Western Europe and East Asia—closer to fruition.

Sea ice, by definition, is already in the water and therefore doesn't add to rising ocean levels as it dissolves. The same logic does not apply to Greenland’s melting glaciers and ice sheets. Last year, Greenland saw the second-largest melt on record. The hot season lasted a troubling 30 to 40 days longer than usual in the northeast portion of the region.

There's enough water locked up in Greenland’s ice sheet to raise seas worldwide by 20 feet. While it may take centuries to fully melt, scientists are concerned that we have a limited time to act to prevent the climate from locking in the ice sheet’s demise.

Life in the Arctic is changing along with the climate. “Green ice” has appeared in recent years. Named for its distinctive hue, this ice is so thin that sunlight shines through, allowing phytoplankton to thrive. Vegetation growth in parts of Canadian and Russian Arctic waters has boomed to from 5 and 19 percent above the 2003-2015 average, according to NOAA. What the change means for delicate ecosystems and fish stocks is the subject of increasing research attention.

In a presentation in November, Johan Rockström, environmental scientist and director of the Stockholm Resilience Center, reached for scientific euphemism to make manageable the enormous scale of these interlocking changes—and who needs to be thinking about them: “Canada, Russia and parts of the U.S. seem to be the Arctic nations subject to the largest, let’s say, set of diverse regime-shift risks.""

In the long run, every part of the Arctic food web may have to adjust to the warming atmosphere’s byproduct: altered ocean chemistry.

Oceans do humanity a huge favor by absorbing some atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, when CO2 dissolves into water, it becomes a weak acid that, as it accumulates, may strain ecosystems that have evolved for today’s slightly alkaline waters. The change is happening globally, but cold water “acidifies” more quickly than warmer seas.

Arctic land stores about twice as much carbon as the atmosphere. While growing seasons—which are now either longer or newly possible, depending on the exact location—suck in carbon dioxide during the spring and summer, scientists believe the thawing lands are now emitting more carbon than they take in.

Perhaps the most visually dramatic change in the landscape has been occurring in Russia. Warming temperatures have accelerated the rate of natural underground methane leaks. The gas builds up in the soil, forming mounds called “pingoes.” When the pressure becomes too great, the ground explodes, leaving 30 to 40-meter-wide craters.

Seismologists have begun to install sensors in the Russian Arctic to give advance notice of fields ready to blow their top. These local events are a powerful visual example of how the world is changing in dramatic and surprising ways.

Many scientists who study the Arctic say that there’s simply no way such dramatic change at the top of the world can avoid affecting life below it. There’s already a cliche: What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic.",very_high,"Accurate, Insightful",162,"This Bloomberg article gives a brief overview of ways in which the Arctic is changing as it warms, including the loss of sea ice and the thawing of permafrost.

So while the extent and area of sea ice might be at a lowest point, it remains to be seen if this will materialize in a similar level for the volume of ice.

Having said that, the temperature and ice coverage anomalies of the 2016/2017 Fall/Winter have been remarkable and have further triggered scientists’ curiosity.",,,,“Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated.”,"Caution must be exercised when making such statements, and in particular how they should be interpreted.

It is a fact that the observed linear trend in summer Arctic sea ice extent is more negative than the average of all the models having participated to the third and fifth phase of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP3/5).

It is also a fact that individual model realizations, and in fact a non-negligible number of them, have more negative trends than observed: this is the case for 17 out of 66 (~26%) in the CMIP5 ensemble (figure below). From there, we can’t robustly exclude that the observed and simulated trends are statistically different from each other.

Each model is represented with a single simulation. (c) CMIP5 sea ice extent trend distributions over the period 1979–2010 for the Arctic in September. Altogether 66 realizations are shown from 26 different models (historical simulations extended after 2005 with RCP4.5 projections). They are compared against the observations-based estimates of the trends (green and blue vertical lines). Source: adapted from IPCC AR5 WG1, Chapter 9, Fig. 9.24

Let’s make a thought experiment and rewind nature back to 1979. Then let’s clap our hands, creating an infinitesimal disturbance in the atmosphere. Due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, this disturbance will cause nature to follow a different path from the one we have known. The trend in sea ice extent will also be different, and potentially very different from the one we have observed, according to model simulations*.

What to understand from this? While these random effects of internal variability can be averaged out by running multiple times the same models, or different models, the same can’t be done for the (one) observation we have. We have to acknowledge that the difference between the (one) observed trend and the average simulated trend can, in part, be explained by internal variability that, by definition, historical climate model simulations are not supposed to anticipate. Hence, the statement that sea ice extent has shrunk faster than anticipated has to be taken with care.

Notz (2015) How well must climate models agree with observations?, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A
","The main take-home message is that sea ice is disappearing very fast and we know why. It’s a clear response to the fact that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are now higher than have been in at least 2 million years, mainly due to burning fossil fuels. The sea ice is a critical component of the Earth’s climate system, and losing over half of it in less than a human generation is already having repercussions well beyond the Arctic.

Normal pingoes are widespread even on the Alaskan North Slope, and they are generally believed to be ice-cored. The “alternative” pingoes that have been in the news recently and that the Bloomberg article alludes to would not have ice at their cores, according to that interpretation. Many workers have measured high methane concentrations in and near these craters on the Yamal Peninsula, but I have no way of knowing whether (a) methane is genetically related to the craters’ evolution or (b) the craters evolve first by still-not-understood processes and the crater then has access to methane that is already in the surrounding/underlying soils or produced by microbes acting on buried organic carbon (so the methane leaking into the crater is what causes high concentrations within). I also can’t say whether the phenomenon of crater formation is widespread enough and whether these craters are releasing enough methane to the atmosphere for these features to have an appreciable impact on high-latitude methane releases.

"Analysis of “From extreme drought to record rain: Why California’s drought-to-deluge cycle is getting worse”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/climate-context-for-a-wet-winter-in-drought-stricken-california-in-the-la-times-rong-gong-lin-ii-paige-st-john-los-angeles-times/,From extreme drought to record rain: Why California’s drought-to-deluge cycle is getting worse,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-record-rains-20170410-story.html,"Reporting from Soda Springs, Calif. — California’s climate has long been dominated by cycles of intense dry conditions followed by heavy rain and snow.
But never before in recorded history has the state seen such an extreme drought-to-deluge swing.

Experts and state water officials say California is seeing more of these intense weather swings as temperatures warm, which has profound implications for the droughts and floods the state may face in the generations to come.

By Wednesday or Thursday, a new series of late-season storms is expected to vault this winter into the history books, making this year the wettest winter for California’s northern Sierra Nevada in nearly a century of record-keeping. This is significant because the mountain range supplies large amounts of water for the rest of the state.

The expected milestone is all the more remarkable given that just two years before, the state was experiencing record dry conditions.

“We went from a driest-on-record scenario to a wettest-on-record scenario,” said David Rizzardo, chief of the snow survey section at the California Department of Water Resources.

Drought-to-deluge cycle
The extreme cycles of dry and wet weather appear to have been intensifying over the last three decades.

“When you look at the other five wettest years other than this one, the earliest of those is 1982,” Rizzardo said. “When you look at the snowpack, the three driest years on record are 2015, 1991, and 1977.”

The shift has coincided with increases in California temperatures that scientists say began about 1980.

“The dry periods are drier and the wet periods are wetter,” said Jeffrey Mount, a water expert and senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. “That is consistent with what the climate simulations are suggesting would be a consequence for California under a warming planet.”

Warming global temperatures can have a profound effect on weather patterns across the planet. Changing the distribution of warmth in the ocean drives changes in the atmosphere, which ultimately decides how much precipitation gets to California, Mount said.

Warm weather worsened the most recent five-year drought, which included the driest four-year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation. California’s first-, second- and third-hottest years on record, in terms of statewide average temperatures, were 2014, 2015 and 2016. And it’s no coincidence that California’s extreme water supply woes coincided with hot weather.

Warm temperatures in 2015 made the precipitation that did fall drop as rain instead of snow. Some rain that fell in the early part of that winter had to be flushed out to sea to keep space available in reservoirs just in case flooding came later. By spring 2015, the Sierra and Cascades produced a dubious historical record — the smallest snowpack on record, just 5% of average.

And this winter’s near disaster at the overflowing Lake Oroville was in part caused by warm storms too. Exceptional water flows into the state’s second-largest reservoir came not only from a constant stream of “atmospheric river” storms that happened to strike California but also because so much precipitation was coming down as warmer rain. Colder snow would not have posed an immediate flood risk.

California water officials have been discussing how warming will affect the state’s water system. Now some officials believe they will have to change the infrastructure — such as building or raising dams and constructing two giant tunnels underneath the confluence of the state’s two largest rivers — to deal with more precipitation falling as rain and snow melting more quickly.

Not everyone is convinced that the evidence is in that climate change is responsible for extreme swings between drought and deluge.

After all, humans have only been recording rainfall and the snowpack for a relatively short period of time in California. “I think the evidence is not very conclusive. But this surely bears watching over the coming years,” said Dan Cayan of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego.

“Whether this is occurring because of climate change or because we’re unlucky kind of doesn’t matter, because we have to deal with it either way,” said Jay Lund, director for the Center for Watershed Sciences at UC Davis.

In Sierras, a winter that won’t end
Two years ago, the lack of snow left locals in Soda Springs and many other parts of the Sierra stunned and anxious.

The drought hurt ski resorts and changed the landscape of the Sierras. In some areas, trees died at an alarming rate. In others, the typically snow-capped mountains were bare and dry.

This winter, however, many residents say they’ve never seen so much snow.

As of Tuesday, an astonishing 87.7 inches of precipitation across a zone of eight stations in the northern Sierra has been recorded since October. That’s just shy of the 88.5 inches recorded by the conclusion of the 1982-83 rain year.

“There’s just been too many road closures, too many power outages, and just too much snow and nowhere to put it,” said Janet Tuttle, who with her husband owns Donner Ski Ranch, one of the oldest ski resorts in the state. She had a better season financially in the very ordinary weather of last year.

Kelley Bernard, 37, didn’t spend the winter here by choice. She was reassigned by the U.S. Postal Service a year and a half ago to singlehandedly staff the Soda Springs-Norden office where some 500 mountaintop residents collect their mail.

She has made the 30-mile, 4,300-foot ascent from snow-less Colfax every day in a family van, even those days when Interstate 80 was closed by blinding storms. The first time she put on her new tire chains, it took her 45 minutes to finish one tire, “and I cried, calling my supervisor, saying, ‘I can’t do this!’”

More than 750 inches of snow later, Bernard has not missed a single day. She has videos of herself sitting in terror in the minivan, stuck in a white-out with snow up to the axles. She can slap chains on both wheels now in less than seven minutes.

“So it’s been a blessing,” she said from behind the mail counter. “I never thought I could be this tough.”

More water — until the next dry spell
The intense winter prompted Gov. Jerry Brown last week to finally declare the drought over in all counties except Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne, where diminished groundwater levels still require a need for emergency drinking water. But right now, the above-ground water supply is much improved for most parts of the state.

Many of California’s reservoirs are healthy and full. Lake Shasta, California’s largest reservoir, is 93% full. San Luis Reservoir, an important holding area for water that will later be sent to Southern California, is at 98% of capacity.

The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is hoping to add 1 million acre-feet of water to its so-called dry-year storage. That would get its total storage up to 2.3 million acre-feet, which would almost get the district’s storage up to its high point in 2012, said Demetri Polyzos, senior water resource management engineer for the MWD.

That would last a few years if consecutive dry years return to California.

The next drought, officials say, could be just around the corner.",high,"Accurate, Sound reasoning",64,"This article in The Los Angeles Times discusses the recent exceptionally wet winter in California, which followed several years of extreme drought conditions.

Warming temperatures are expected to increase the magnitude of both dry years (since evaporation increases with temperature) and wet years (since a warmer atmosphere has a greater “water-holding capacity”), which can sound counterintuitive at first.

Scientists who reviewed the article found it to be a generally accurate description of the state of scientific knowledge on these complex topics.

There is also an expectation that such swings between extreme dry and extreme wet will continue to become more pronounced as the climate warms*.

","Yes, variability in California precipitation appears to have been higher in the past 3-4 decades than the previous decades, but it is not (and cannot be) clear that that the variability in precipitation is actually currently in the act of increasing. I say that it cannot be clear because it takes decades of data (say 2-3) to characterize the current “variability” of the climate. Based on my calculations, variability in annual precipitation totals increased considerably during the second half of the 1900s and then has remained at this relatively high level for the past couple decades, but has not clearly continued to increase. This latest swing from record dry to very wet in the last year is consistent with high variability, but it’s a single event and not necessarily indicative of a trend.

There are some logical links, however, that support the inference that wild swings like the current one should be expected to become more likely. First, droughts are becoming increasingly impacted by warming temperatures. Even if precipitation behavior didn’t change at all, years with low precipitation would correspond to less and less water availability for humans and ecosystems. Second, current climate models project variability of California precipitation to increase in the future, with an increase in the frequency of years with very high precipitation totals becoming detectable sometime in the first half of this century, and an increase in the frequency of years with very low precipitation totals becoming detectable in the second half of this century*.

It should always be remembered, however, that models have a tough time with California precipitation. California is right on the boundary between projections of drying to the south and wetting to the north. I personally believe the basic expectation that California precipitation should become more variable, but beyond that I don’t yet put much stock in what models have to say about the future of precipitation in California.

So, variability has increased overall in the last century, and this is consistent with what models project to occur as a result of greenhouse-gas driven climate change. The increase in variability hasn’t been a monotonic trend, however, and it is not obvious from the data that the trend is continuing now as rapidly as it was in previous decades. This suggests that other low-frequency processes are also at play that influence decade-to-decade changes in the variability and magnitude of annual precipitation totals, making it particularly difficult to determine the degree to which this current event can be attributed to climate change. Nonetheless, California would be wise to prepare for more events like these.

California’s first-, second- and third-hottest years on record, in terms of statewide average temperatures, were 2014, 2015 and 2016.”

","This claim is supported by a wide range of scientific research*. Record warmth during the recent drought has also been directly implicated in some of the most iconic drought impacts, such as extreme lack of Sierra Nevada snowpack* and a large increase in wildfire intensity*.

","There is evidence that warmer temperatures across the globe affect large-scale atmospheric dynamics, which in turn feed into regional weather patterns. The relevant example here is the argument that a warming Arctic will reduce large-scale temperature gradients in the atmosphere, which will in turn affect (and be affected by) the complex path that storms follow across the Pacific Ocean as they approach the North American west coast.

While the extent to which this has already happened is debatable*, there is agreement that it will be a robust signal if Arctic warming continues unabated*.

",,,“And this winter’s near disaster at the overflowing Lake Oroville was in part caused by warm storms too.”,"The skewed rain-snow ratio this season certainly contributed to some of the precipitation-related impacts this winter. While winter 2016-2017 was not exceptionally warm in the Sierra Nevada, especially relative to recent record-warm years, it was still warmer than average. In middle elevation zones of the Sierra Nevada, precipitation fell as rain rather than snow more often that would have historically been the case—leading to a snowpack that significantly lagged overall liquid precipitation (although both were well above average). (See this article in Eos.)",,,,"“Not everyone is convinced that the evidence is in that climate change is responsible for extreme swings between drought and deluge.”

","There is a considerable and growing body of scientific evidence (see above references) demonstrating that California will likely experience increasingly large swings between extreme wet and extreme dry conditions. The evidence that climate change has already caused such an increase is somewhat less strong—mainly because there are relatively few extreme events in the historical record from which to draw such conclusions.

Therefore, this statement is imprecise, and may be misleading if it is intended to convey that scientists substantially disagree regarding the likely future increase in California precipitation extremes. Whether such an increase is yet detectable in the historical record is indeed uncertain; there is much greater certainty regarding the likely direction of future change.",,,,"“‘The dry periods are drier and the wet periods are wetter,’ said Jeffrey Mount, a water expert and senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.”","This is seen in assessments of atmospheric reanalyses, which show a decreasing frequency of rain-producing weather systems over California but higher rain rates over the last 35 years*.

In the battle against rising seas, the region – which has more to lose than almost anywhere else in the world – is becoming ground zero.

BBC Future has brought you in-depth and rigorous stories to help you navigate the current pandemic, but we know that’s not all you want to read. So now we’re dedicating a series to help you escape. We’ll be revisiting our most popular features from the last three years in our Lockdown Longreads.  

You’ll find everything from the story about the world’s greatest space mission to the truth about whether our cats really love us, the epic hunt to bring illegal fishermen to justice and the small team which brings long-buried World War Two tanks back to life. What you won’t find is any reference to, well, you-know-what. Enjoy.

The first time my father’s basement flooded, it was shortly after he moved in. The building was an ocean-front high-rise in a small city north of Miami called Sunny Isles Beach. The marble lobby had a waterfall that never stopped running; crisp-shirted valets parked your car for you. For the residents who lived in the more lavish flats, these cars were often BMWs and Mercedes. But no matter their value, the cars all wound up in the same place: the basement.

When I called, I’d ask my dad how the building was doing. “The basement flooded again a couple weeks ago,” he’d sometimes say. Or: “It’s getting worse.” It’s not only his building: he’s also driven through a foot of water on a main road a couple of towns over and is used to tiptoeing around pools in the local supermarket’s car park.

Ask nearly anyone in the Miami area about flooding and they’ll have an anecdote to share. Many will also tell you that it’s happening more and more frequently. The data backs them up.

It’s easy to think that the only communities suffering from sea level rise are far-flung and remote. And while places like the Solomon Islands and Kiribati are indeed facing particularly dramatic challenges, they aren’t the only ones being forced to grapple with the issue. Sea levels are rising around the world, and in the US, south Florida is ground zero – as much for the adaptation strategies it is attempting as for the risk that it bears.

One reason is that water levels here are rising especially quickly. The most frequently-used range of estimates puts the likely range between 15-25cm (6-10in) above 1992 levels by 2030, and 79-155cm (31-61in) by 2100. With tides higher than they have been in decades – and far higher than when this swampy, tropical corner of the US began to be drained and built on a century ago – many of south Florida’s drainage systems and seawalls are no longer enough. That means not only more flooding, but challenges for the infrastructure that residents depend on every day, from septic tanks to wells. “The consequences of sea level rise are going to occur way before the high tide reaches your doorstep,” says William Sweet, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The flooding would be a challenge for any community, but it poses particular risks here. One recent report estimated that Miami has the most to lose in terms of financial assets of any coastal city in the world, just above Guangzhou, China and New York City. This 120-mile (193km) corridor running up the coast from Homestead to Jupiter – taking in major cities like Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach – is the eighth most populous metropolitan area in the US. It’s also booming. In 2015, the US Census Bureau found that the population of all three counties here was growing – along with the rest of Florida – at around 8%, roughly twice the pace of the US average. Recent studies have shown that Florida has more residents at risk from climate change than any other US state.

It has more property at risk, too. In Miami-Dade County, developers had 1.6 million sq ft (149,000 sq m) of office space and 1.8 million of retail space under construction in the second quarter of 2016 alone. Sunny Isles Beach, home to 20,300 people, has eight high-rise buildings under construction; swing a seagull in the air, and you’ll hit a crane. As you might imagine, the value of development in this sun-soaked part of the country is high, too. Property in Sunny Isles alone is now worth more than $10 billion. Many of the wealthiest people in the US reside in Florida, including 40 billionaires on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans; on a recent week, the most expensive real estate listing in the US was a $54 million mansion in Palm Beach.

Despite his history of referring to climate change as a “hoax” and his recent rollback of emissions-slashing initiatives, President Donald Trump is one of these property owners with a stake in the issue. The president frequently visits his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, 75 miles (121km) north of Miami, which is itself an area experiencing flooding from high tides. There also are six Trump-branded residential buildings in Sunny Isles, one of which still provides the president with income, and a Trump-branded condominium complex in Hollywood.

Look beyond all the glass and steel, though, and – despite the federal government’s sidelining of the issue – there’s another thrum of activity. It’s the wastewater treatment plant constructing new buildings five feet higher than the old ones. The 105 miles (169km) of roads being raised in Miami Beach. The new shopping mall built with flood gates. The 116 tidal valves installed in Fort Lauderdale. The seawalls being raised and repaired. And the worried conversations between more and more residents every year about what the sea-rise models predict – and what to do about it.

The communities aren’t short of solutions. “Nobody’s doing better adaptation work in the country than south Florida,” says Daniel Kreeger, executive director of the nonprofit Association of Climate Change Officers. But the question isn’t whether this work will save every community: it won’t. Even those tasked with making their cities resilient admit that, at some point in the future, certain areas here will no longer be “viable” places to live. Rather, the challenge is to do enough to ensure that the economy as a whole continues to thrive and that tourists still come to enjoy the sun, sand – and swelling sea.

It’s a challenge that many officials and experts are determined to meet. Getting there, though, requires a shift in how everyone from mayors to taxpayers, insurers to engineers, property developers to urban planners thinks about their communities – and the everyday decisions that shape them. The eyes of the world are on them: if one of the richest communities on the planet can’t step up, what hope is there for everyone else?

“If the science is correct on this – which it is going to be – the question is, ‘How extreme are the implications?’” says Kreeger. “We are literally going to have to rewrite how businesses function, and how cities are designed. Everything’s going to change. And that’s particularly going to be exacerbated in coastal communities.

“This would be no different than if I came to you and said ‘Hey, in 40 years, gravity’s going to change. I can’t tell you exactly what it’s going to be. But let’s assume roughly between 50% and 80% stronger or weaker than it is now.’ You’d look around and say ‘Shoot, what’s that going to affect?’

""And the answer is: it affects everything.”

Sea level rise is global. But due to a variety of factors – including, for this part of the Atlantic coast, a likely weakening of the Gulf Stream, itself potentially a result of the melting of Greenland’s ice caps – south Floridians are feeling the effects more than many others. While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.

That may not sound like much. But as an average, it doesn’t tell the whole story of what residents see – including more extreme events like king tides (extremely high tides), which have been getting dramatically higher. What’s more, when you’re talking about places like Miami Beach – where, as chief resiliency officer Susanne Torriente jokes, the elevation ranges between “flat and flatter” – every millimetre counts. Most of Miami Beach’s built environment sits at an elevation of 60-120cm (2-6ft). And across the region, underground infrastructure – like aquifers or septic tanks – lies even closer to the water table.

On a nearly two-hour tour of Fort Lauderdale’s adaptation strategies, the city’s head of sustainability, Nancy Gassman, points out incremental differences in elevation: slight rolls in the sidewalk or paving that usually go unnoticed. “That might seem weird that I’m pointing out a couple of feet difference,” she says. “But a couple feet in south Florida – it’s time. Elevation is time for us.”

Not only are sea levels rising, but the pace seems to be accelerating. That’s been noted before – but what it means for south Florida was only recently brought home in a University of Miami study. “After 2006, sea level rose faster than before – and much faster than the global rate,” says the lead author Shimon Wdowinski, who is now with Miami’s Florida International University. From 3mm per year from 1998 to 2005, the rise off Miami Beach tripled to that 9mm rate from 2006.

An uptick also happened between the 1930s and 1950s, says Wdowinski, making some question whether this is a similar oscillation. But that’s probably wishful thinking. “It’s not necessarily what we see now. This warming of the planet has been growing for a while,” he says. “It’s probably a different process than what happened 60 years ago.”

“Can we definitely say it’s the ocean warming?” says Sweet, who has authored several sea-level rise studies. “No. But is it indicative of what we’d expect to see? Yes.”

Modelling specific future scenarios is difficult – partly because scientists are still collecting and analysing data, partly because there are so many variables. What if the US or China reverses its trend on stabilising emissions? What if a major volcano erupts? What if a glacier melts more quickly than expected? But enough credible projections have been done to put together a range of scenarios that researchers are confident about.

One graph compiled in 2015 by the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, a non-partisan initiative that collates expertise and coordinates efforts across Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe and Palm Beach counties, is especially revealing (see below). At the bottom is a dotted green line, which rises slowly. Before you get optimistic, the footnote is firm: “This scenario would require significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in order to be plausible and does not reflect current emissions trends.” More probable is the range in the middle, shaded blue, which shows that a 6-10in (15-25cm) rise above 1992 levels is likely by 2030. At the top, the orange line is more severe still, going off the chart – to 81 inches (206cm) – by the end of the century.

But as more data comes in, even the worst-case estimates may turn out to be too low: for example, researchers recently discovered that ice is melting more rapidly than expected from both Antarctica and Greenland, plus gained a better understanding of how melting ice sheets actually affect sea-level rise. “The unlikely scenarios are now, all of a sudden, becoming more probable than they once were thought to be,” says Sweet.

The most dramatic impacts may not be felt for 50 or 100 years. But coastal communities are already experiencing more storms and extremely high tides known as king tides. In the same study, Wdowinski found there were a total of 16 flood events in Miami Beach from 1998 to 2005. From 2006 to 2013, there were 33.

Although the timing of king tides results from the positions of the Sun, Moon and Earth, rising seas heighten their effect. At extreme high tides, water levels have surged to an inch below the Intracoastal Waterway, says Jennifer Jurado, Broward County’s chief resiliency officer. “Once that’s breached, you’re open to the ocean – the supply of water is endless. The system is really at capacity. These are flood conditions, even with just the high tide and supermoon… You see men in business suits trying to trudge through water.”

Even without floods, the rising water table affects everything. The cities here are built on porous limestone. The water doesn’t just come over seawalls; it seeps up from beneath the streets. Nearly 90% of the drinking water in south Florida comes from aquifers, and these are finding their fresh water pushed further and further inland as the salt water exerts more and more pressure. Take Hallandale Beach, a small city of just under 40,000 residents. Saltwater already has breached five of the eight freshwater wells that the city draws from, says Vice Mayor Keith London. And around a quarter of Miami-Dade residents use septic tanks. If these don’t remain above the water table, the result could be thoroughly unpleasant.

Another issue is beach erosion. Florida’s sand may be one of its biggest draws for tourist dollars, but it, too, is vulnerable: though sand never stays put, rising sea levels and worsening storms mean the need to replenish is intensifying. A massive town-by-town project is currently underway; Miami Beach (which, famously, was manmade from the start) just wrapped up its 3,000ft (914m) section, to the tune of $11.9 million.

Of course, another part of the problem is that south Florida is built on a swamp. “The only reason we live here is we learned how to drain it, we learned how to kill mosquitos, and we created air conditioning,” says Jim Murley, chief resilience officer for Miami-Dade County. Residents cut canals to drain inland areas, using the fill to raise the land and build properties. These canals are now open doors for tidal flooding and storm surge. They also cut down mangrove forests and levelled sand dunes – both natural barriers to flooding.

“There is going to need to be a very serious conversation about how we deal with this,” says George Vallejo, the mayor of North Miami Beach. “The development that has happened here over the last 40 or 50 years has not been helpful to this situation. We’ve paved over a lot of the Everglades, we’ve paved over a lot of greenage.

“We’ve done a lot of things that, in retrospect, we would have done differently, knowing what we know now.”

That’s the bad news. But there’s good news, says Gassman, whose no-nonsense demeanour and doctorate in marine biology (with a focus on coastal ecosystems) makes her particularly convincing. “That’s all if nothing changes. I think that’s another thing that the public doesn’t necessarily understand: the predictions that they’re hearing, time and time again, are if we do nothing. But we’re not doing nothing.”

That’s point one. Point two is that the topography of the area isn’t quite what you’d expect. She brings out a map of Fort Lauderdale dotted with squares of purple and orange. Purple means an area is likely to be underwater at 2ft (61cm) of sea level rise; orange means it’s possible. A surprisingly small amount of the map is splashed with colour. And the at-risk areas – which are mostly by the bay, not the ocean – aren’t where you might think. “It’s not the whole city,” she says. “While there are problems in some areas, we’ll have to adjust, but these areas are not in places you’d expect – and we’ll have time to address some of these issues.”

Not every community might be so lucky. Play the inundation game with Noaa’s perversely addictive mapping tool in Hollywood, just 10 miles (16km) south of Fort Lauderdale, and you’ll find that the same 2ft (61cm) rise could put streets and most properties of an entire square-mile swathe underwater – not insignificant for a city measuring just 30 sq miles (78 sq km). (Hollywood also has its own intervention programme underway, including the installation of 18 flap gates to keep seawater from coming up through the drainage system). Still, it’s a good reminder that the problem, as overwhelming as it seems, can be broken down into smaller pieces.

Which is exactly what Gassman and others are trying to do. Touring the city with Gassman is to see it in an entirely new way: not just a city of graceful mansions and pretty canals, but of seawalls that are leaking or too short, fire hydrants that are made of iron (“a fundamental, emergency-based infrastructure that’s made out of a material that’s potentially corrosive from saltwater”), drains that are overflowing and electrical boxes that need to be raised.

“See, those cars are disappearing from view,” she says, pointing to the dip in the road in front of us. We turn onto Isle of Capri Drive. “Look what’s happening. Look how far I’m going to go down. This area floods all the time.”

Fort Lauderdale is dubbed the Venice of America. That’s supposed to be because of its 165 miles (266km) of canals, but recent flooding has made the nickname more on the nose than residents would like.

For both Fort Lauderdale and other communities across south Florida, the main problem is drainage. The systems here were designed to let stormwater drain into the ocean when it rains. Because homes and gardens are higher than the crown of the road, the streets flood first in a storm, by design. Water runs into the storm drain and is piped into the ocean or waterways that lead there.

At least, that’s what is supposed to happen. With sea levels now often higher than the exits to the run-off pipes, saltwater is instead running up through the system and into the streets. To make matters worse, when the sea gets even higher, it can breach the seawall, flood people’s yards and flow down to the road – where it stays.

Since 2013, Fort Lauderdale has been installing tidal valves to deal with the problem. Each of the one-way valves, which allows stormwater through but not saltwater, looks like a big rubber tube and can be attached inside the storm drains. Gassman pulls one out to show me. “If you stick your hand in there and push a little bit, see how it opens?” I do. “Right there, you were fresh water. Now you’re about to be salt water.” She flips the valve around. I push: sure enough, it’s a no-go.

In some areas, the valves alone have been enough. But there’s a catch: the floodwater still can’t leave if the tide is above the level of the outflow pipes. That happened early on at one of the first places they installed a valve, Gassman says. A king tide came over the tops of the seawalls, flooded the street – and then remained higher than the outfall. “The valve wouldn’t open. So the roads stayed flooded 24/7,” she says. “We have had complaints that the valves aren’t working. But no. The valves are working.”

Despite the limitations of the valves, it doesn’t take an engineer to figure out that raising seawalls would fix flooding that resulted from high sea levels, if not from rain. But until recently, Fort Lauderdale had a height requirement for seawalls that was a maximum, not a minimum – for aesthetic reasons. Though some now do specify a minimum height, enforcement remains difficult. A new seawall runs from $600 to $2,000 for a linear foot; adding a 12in (30cm) cap costs about $60 per foot. For the average homeowner, a seawall measures 75-100ft (23-30m). “How are you going to force everyone to put in money?” asks Gassman.

It turns out you can’t, at least for now. Last year, Fort Lauderdale proposed that everyone should be made to raise their seawalls to a certain height by 2035. Thanks to opposition from the public, the proposal failed. Instead, property owners are required to keep their seawalls in a state of good repair. Someone can be reported to the authorities if their seawall is breached by the tide, but the specific new height requirement only kicks in if someone came to ask for the permit – which is required to do significant repairs, or to build a new wall. And Fort Lauderdale makes an interesting test case: if costs seem prohibitive in this relatively well-off area, it’s not going to work in south Florida’s less affluent communities – some of which also are suffering from similar flooding.

Despite Fort Lauderdale’s best efforts, seawalls here remain a patchwork of heights and states of repair. At Cordova Road, Gassman and I look over the finger isles pointing into the Stranahan River. Across the road from the marina, one house has bright-green grass: it’s new, put down after a flood last spring swamped their property with salt water.

Gassman points to an older house on the corner. Their seawall is about a foot lower than their neighbour’s. “That foot of difference allows water to run over their property and flood the road,” she says. “That one property, if we could fix that seawall, we could reduce a lot of flooding, right here.”

It’s not just residents who need to make changes. The city also owns a seawall along this stretch; it, too, was breached recently. Replacing the nearly half-mile stretch could cost up to $5 million. But getting the funds is just the first challenge. The end of the seawall meets a bridge. If you raise the seawall two more feet, what do you do with that bridge to protect it? And what about the docks that residents are currently allowed to have here, all of which will have to be re-done? “The people that live here want a solution and they want it now,” says Gassman. “But there’s both a public and a private cost. And changing one piece of infrastructure starts to domino into needing to change all sorts of things.”

As well as seawalls, cities are investing in pumps. Many have put pump stations in the worst-hit neighbourhoods. But only Miami Beach has adopted an integrated, major pumping system as part of an aggressive overall defence strategy. Starting in 2013, the programme – which Torriente estimates will cost between $400 and $500 million – is multi-pronged. Pump stations have sprouted across Sunset Harbour, an industrial-turned-hip neighbourhood on the barrier island’s bay side, and are moving south.

Roads are being raised, too, sometimes by up to 2ft (61cm), to an elevation which the Southeast Florida Climate Compact’s projections put as a likely sea level height around 2065. Seawalls are being raised to a new minimum – something that residents in Miami Beach were more amenable to than in Fort Lauderdale. The city also is requiring that all new properties build their first floor higher.

It’s an ambitious agenda. And it’s one that’s working. Areas where roads have been raised and pumps installed have been much drier. But, as Gassman noted, it’s not enough to change one piece of infrastructure without changing everything else. In this case, what happens when you raise a road without raising all of the properties around it? Water can go into the properties.

That’s not supposed to happen when the pumps work. But they can fail. Antonio Gallo’s Sardinia Enoteca Ristorante is one of a number of businesses that have found their ground floors are now below the current road and sidewalk height. Last year, the pumps failed to kick in after a brief period of rain; the restaurant flooded, with diners stuck inside. When Gallo went to file his insurance claim, it was turned down. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which runs a national flood insurance programme for at-risk business and property owners like Gallo, anything below street level is considered a basement. Until Fema changes their policy, that includes all of the businesses now below the raised streets. Miami Beach is working closely with Fema to get not only Gallo’s situation, but the general basement classification, re-assessed.

Miami Beach’s efforts are the most aggressive. But resilience also can be built into existing projects. A lot of public infrastructure is built to last for at least 50 or 75 years, and that means planning for what the world will look like then. This is where the Compact’s range of scenarios comes in handy. If you’re laying down something easily replaceable, like a sidewalk, you could build for one of the more optimistic scenarios. An airport? It’s a good idea to go for a higher-risk scenario.

Murley, the chief resilience officer of Miami-Dade County (the county's first), points to a 4,200ft-long (1280m) tunnel that runs from the Port of Miami to highway I395. Opened in 2014, its main objective was to re-route lorries that previously went through downtown Miami. But the tunnel was also given a huge gate that, in a hurricane, drops down to seal it at both ends. “That’s an example of resilience. We wouldn’t have built that 10 years ago,” says Murley. “We would have built the tunnel, but it would have had an open front. We might have had sand bags.”

A larger-scale example of built-in resilience is going on at the Central District Wastewater and Treatment Plant on Virginia Key, a barrier island where Biscayne Bay and the ocean meet, just east of downtown Miami. It is one of three wastewater treatment plants run by the largest utility in Florida, which serves 2.3 million of the county’s 2.6 million residents. Like the other two, it sits right by the water.

The plant already had a $500 million project on the go, making changes to comply with new Clean Water Act requirements. But because parts of the facility are expected to last 75 years or more, resilience to higher sea levels and storm surge has been baked into the design. Analysts ran what would be needed in a worst-case scenario: a category five hurricane during a king tide, with maximum rainfall. “What the results told us was that we ought to be building stuff at 17-20ft (5-6m) above sea level on the coast. Our current facilities, by and large, range from 10-15ft (3-4.5m),” says Doug Yoder, deputy director of Miami-Dade’s water and sewer department. The new design standards prioritise building at those elevations first for parts of the plants that convey flow – like the electrical wiring and pumps. “At least we won’t have raw sewage flooding the streets,” says Yoder.

Private developers will need to think about these issues, too. According to the non-partisan research organisation Risky Business, current projections put between $15 billion and $23 billion of existing Florida property underwater by 2050. By the end of the century, that leaps to between $53 and $208 billion.

But many developers aren’t thinking to 2050 or 2100. Their focus is on the time from construction to sale. In a hot real estate market like south Florida, where a lot of investors are foreign or periodic visitors, that timeframe is far shorter – a few years at most.

Until regulations enforce common building standards, few private developers are likely to adopt resilient designs. “I think it’s very hard for a developer or builder to do something the code or government doesn’t require in their zoning or building code,” says Wayne Pathman, a Miami-based land use and zoning attorney and the chairman of the new City of Miami Sea Level Rise committee.

One exception is Brickell City Centre, a $1 billion, 9-acre complex of stores, restaurants, offices, condominiums and hotel in Brickell, a corner of downtown Miami filled with cranes and skyscrapers. Developed by Hong Kong-based Swire Properties, the complex is sleek and airy – and, says Chris Gandolfo, vice president of development for Swire’s US operations, resilient. “Starting years ago, Swire was progressive in its thinking on rising tides,” he says.

Gandolfo ticks off some of the adaptation strategies that were used: building higher than the current flood plain; flood gates that can seal off the underground car park; an elevated seawall. It also has sustainable features like green roofs, native plants and what the developers have dubbed a “climate ribbon” – a walkway that captures the bay winds to cool the structure and lower energy costs, and works as a cistern to re-use rainwater for irrigation. “We may not make immediate returns,” Gandolfo says. “But I think it’ll have long-term returns.”

All of this puts a catch-22 at the heart of south Florida’s development. The state levies no personal or business income taxes and has a low corporate income tax, meaning property taxes provide a major source of revenue. But unless it is managed very carefully, new development brings new challenges.

“Every one of these buildings that goes up expands your vulnerability and magnitude of risk,” says Kreeger. “On the flip side, you’re not getting help from the state, because the state legislature and governor are in total denial about climate change. So you’re bringing in money today which is going to help you. But you’re also bringing a bigger problem tomorrow.”

*

Thinking about any of this is a relatively new trend. Although scientists began speaking about sea level rise for several decades, the topic only saw real traction among local governments and businesses a few years ago.

Part of the reason is that the issue was being ignored by so many others. Most officials say that the Compact, signed in 2010, has been a major driver in helping local governments collect the data they need and coordinate together on what to do about it – and it was signed after the realisation that, despite concrete problems that had to be solved today, state, federal and international governments weren’t doing what was needed to address them.

The Florida governor is a climate change sceptic and has directed attention away from the issue. Former employees have said they even were told not to utter the phrase “climate change”. Ignoring the issue now appears to pervade the highest levels of US government: the new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief doubts whether carbon dioxide plays a primary role in climate change, while President Trump recently signed an executive order overturning emissions-slashing regulations. Draft versions of the White House budget propose cutting the EPA budget by 31% and employee numbers by 20%, as well as steep cuts to Noaa – including 26% of the funds from its Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and entirely eliminating the Sea Grant programme, whose Florida section brings together 17 different universities to study sea level rise challenges and solutions.

Local governments are forging on, but such circumstances make the challenge even greater. With budgets that run in the tens of millions, not billions, local governments already need to be fiscally creative. Meanwhile, planning depends on up-to-date data – there’s no point in raising seawalls if you don’t know how high they need to be. And some of the most reliable projection scenarios, as well as sea level rise data, is gathered from Noaa.

Yet the impact from these changes won’t stop at party lines. Even President Trump’s family isn’t immune. Three feet of sea level rise – which the range of predictions put together by Compact estimates is likely to happen within the next 60 years – will flood Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.

“It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican commissioner when a neighbour calls you and tells you that their lawn is flooded,” says Gassman. “The water doesn’t care about politics. The water goes where the water goes. And someone who has a flooding problem that’s impacting their quality of life or their property values, they don’t care what flavour their politician is. What they care about is that the city is thinking about it, and that they’re planning to do something about it.”

Some of the communities in south Florida doing the most to adapt to the effects of sea level rise are doing so largely because of public pressure. In 1993, Miami-Dade put together its first plan to reduce carbon emissions. Hardly anyone came out for the committee hearing, Yoder says. Fast-forward to 2015: a hearing on the county’s budget was dominated by one resident after another asking why the county wasn’t doing more about sea level rise.

So much so, in fact, that the county decided to hire Murley, its first resilience officer. One of his immediate tasks was to look into getting onto the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities programme. Accepted cities receive funding and tailored guidance on how to make themselves adaptable to future challenges, from high unemployment to earthquakes and sea-level rise.

Greater Miami is just at the start of the process, Murley says. But he’s not the only one hoping that the resources made available will help guide the area far into the future. When I try to get in touch with the commissioners or mayor of Sunny Isles, I get a call back from Brian Andrews, a crisis PR consultant. He says sea level rise is something the city is aware of, but that “we’re waiting for the county” to gather data and send guidelines for an action plan. “They’re getting millions and millions from the Rockefeller Foundation for this,” he says. “We’re a little city. We couldn’t do it on our own.”

Despite how awareness of the issue has grown in some communities – particularly those, like Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale, that have seen the most flooding – it’s still common for sea-level rise to get shunted to the end of the list of priorities. “As an elected official, when I go knock on doors, resiliency and sea level rise is never discussed,” says Esteban Bovo, chair of the Miami-Dade County Commission. “It’s never talked about. It’s crime, how much we’re going to invest in police, how much we’re going to invest in traffic, how much we’re going to invest in public safety, libraries – those are the topics of conversation.”

Later, I find myself playing with the Noaa sea-level tool again. I zoom in on Sunny Isles. At 1ft, the low-lying mangrove swamps of the Oleta River State Park, just over the water, are submerged and the wooded backyard of the Intracoastal Yacht Club disappears. At 2ft, the St Tropez Condominiums and the newly-built Town Center Park are underwater, as are many shops around 172nd Street. At 3ft, things start to get serious. Blue blots out the entire shopping plaza and the Epicure Market. At 4ft, the entire west side of Sunny Isles is uninhabitable. At 6ft, it’s gone. Only the spine near the beach – where my father lives – remains.

It’s easy to look at Compact’s range of estimates and think that, since a 3ft or 4ft rise may remain fairly far off, everything will be fine for a few more generations. But it’s not. With public infrastructure – from fresh water to flushing toilets to roads – woven between communities, if just one area gets affected, others may suffer. Meanwhile, resilience is only one piece. As shown by the Compact chart’s steep orange line, if emissions continue to rise, adaptation will become increasingly difficult – if not impossible. And unlike raising seawalls or installing tidal valves, that, of course, can’t be controlled by a community or region alone. “Climate change mitigation to reduce greenhouse gases is a global issue and has to be dealt with globally,” says Gassman. “Adaptation to the inevitable effects of climate change is a local issue.”

Later, peering out the window as my plane takes off over Miami, I no longer see the dense green squares of the city's western edge, the sharp skyscrapers downtown and the surprisingly slender line of barrier islands. Instead, I see what might be lost. From here, the ocean looks vast.

But as the plane climbs, I remind myself that human innovation was enough to drain the swamp and make Florida what it is today. It was great enough to get me here, 15,000ft in the air. And it just might be enough to save what I see below.",very_high,,181,"This BBC feature article discusses the challenges that sea level rise poses for Miami, Florida in detail. Global sea level rise projected to occur in the coming decades due to human-induced climate change threatens coastal infrastructure in low-lying areas like southeast Florida.

Scientists who reviewed this story found it to be insightful and generally accurate. They note that care should be taken not to misinterpret short-term variations in local sea level rise trends, such as the higher rate of sea level rise in Florida over the past decade, which is not expected to continue over the long term.

",,,,,"Tal Ezer, Professor, Old Dominion University:","The information in this story is generally correct—the frequency and severity of flooding is accelerating due to sea level rise, and the quoted scientists from NOAA and FAU are credible experts in this field.

","Andrea Dutton, Visiting Associate Professor, University of Wisconsin
","The article provides many internal references to peer-reviewed research, which supports many of the scientific claims made here, including the observation that in recent years the rate of sea-level rise in southeast Florida has accelerated. Additional insight on the implications of the research is made, including the observation that vulnerable infrastructure situated at lower elevations will be critical to sustain even those structures that are at slightly higher elevation; hence it is not the elevation of your home that is as critical as the elevation of the infrastructure that supports it. However, having argued throughout the piece that sea levels are rising quickly in this region and that a swift, coordinated response is required, I found the ending overly optimistic. It is not helpful to sustain the unrealistic belief that human innovation will enable us to just engineer our way out of this situation in south Florida indefinitely.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Not only are sea levels rising, but the pace seems to be accelerating”","The largest change in rate of sea-level rise is between the background pre-industrial period and the 20th century. Sea-level rose 1.27 ± 0.09m in northeastern Florida (USA) during the past ~2600 years, a rate of about 0.49 mm/yr. The tide-gauge data from nearby Fernandina Beach, measures 1.91 ± 0.26mm/yr of RSL rise since 1900CE.

",,,,"“The most frequently-used range of estimates puts the likely range between 15-25cm (6-10in) above 1992 levels by 2030, and 79-155cm (31-61in) by 2100.”",It is true that these are commonly used projections in this region. This statement refers to the Unified Sea Level Rise Projection that was produced by the Southeast Florida Regional Compact on Climate Change.,,,,"“enough credible projections have been done to put together a range of scenarios that researchers are confident about”

","Many projections have been done, but they may very well underestimate the true expected range of scenarios.",,,,"“But as more data comes in, even the worst-case estimates may turn out to be too low: for example, researchers recently discovered that ice is melting more rapidly than expected from both Antarctica and Greenland, plus gained a better understanding of how melting ice sheets actually affect sea-level rise. ‘The unlikely scenarios are now, all of a sudden, becoming more probable than they once were thought to be,’ says Sweet.”

","This is true, based on the research cited here. The dynamics of rapid ice sheet retreat remain uncertain which introduces uncertainty into the projections.",,,,“The most dramatic impacts may not be felt for 50 or 100 years.”,"While the most dramatic effects may not be felt until 50 to 100 years from now, that does not mean that dramatic impacts will not occur before then.",,,,“many of south Florida’s drainage systems and seawalls are no longer enough”,"This statement is true based on several different analyses. For example, in a study* that quantified the reduction of flood control capabilities of coastal water control gravity structures owing to increased sea level rise, they found that “sea level change could negatively impact nearly half the coastal flow control structures in the coming decades, unless adaptive measures are implemented to mitigate such impacts.”

Obeysekera et al (2011) Climate change and its implications for water resources management in south Florida, Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment",,,,"“Sea level rise is global. But due to a variety of factors – including, for this part of the Atlantic coast, a likely weakening of the Gulf Stream, itself potentially a result of the melting of Greenland’s ice caps – south Floridians are feeling the effects more than many others. While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.”

","The main reason for higher than normal local sea level rise in places like Miami, FL, and Norfolk, VA, is that in addition to well documented global sea level rise, there are places with local land subsidence and also influence from ocean currents like the Gulf Stream.
The influence of the Gulf Stream on the coast is my expertise*, but the issue is quite complicated. It is true that slowdown of the Gulf Stream will cause sea level to rise along the US East Coast and there are some signs that the Gulf Stream started to slow down due to long-term climate change, weakening the entire Atlantic Ocean circulation. However, short term fluctuations in the Gulf Stream (which may or may not relate to climate change) can also create periods of higher than normal water levels and unpredictable tidal flooding, and this is an area of active recent research.

Ezer et al (2013) Gulf Stream’s induced sea level rise and variability along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans
","This statement touches upon several issues that are indeed discussed in the scientific literature and it is essentially correct. Let’s try and disentangle things.

It is correct that Virginia Key as well as other locations on the US Atlantic coast have experienced a surge of rapid sea-level rise during the past ten years or so. However, this is a very short period in terms of sea-level variations. The longer-term rise in this region (when corrected for local land subsidence) is actually in line with the global average sea-level rise, both for the past hundred years (~1.8mm per year) or measured since the early 1990s (~3 mm per year). The recent rapid rise is thus likely a short-term natural variation (a possibility mentioned later in the article) and may well be followed by a period of very little rise. In the longer run I would expect that sea-level near Miami would continue to increase roughly in line with the global mean sea-level rise, as is indeed discussed later in the article where the future projections with their uncertainties are covered well.

It is correct that local sea-level rise can differ from global sea-level rise due to “a variety of factors”, including a weakening of the Gulf Stream. For the relevant period of rapid rise, the last ten years or so, such a weakening has been documented, e.g. in the direct measurements in the RAPID section at 26 °N. So the rapid sea-level rise and the weakening of the larger Gulf Stream System coincide, and have indeed been linked.*

Like with sea level, over the short time scale of the past decade this is likely to be dominated by natural variability, although there are also indications of a longer-term, probably human-caused, downward trend. Greenland melting has not caused this, but likely contributed to it.

To what extent the Gulf Stream weakening explains the recent rapid sea-level rise in Miami, and to what extent other factors—like changes in the predominant winds—are responsible remains an open research question.

Ezer et al (2013) Gulf Stream’s induced sea level rise and variability along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans
","True: Sea-level rise in Florida is the result of a variety of factors. But the influence of a weakening Gulf Stream will be felt more in the northeast of the US than Florida. Furthermore, land level subsidence due to glacial isostatic adjustment is less in Florida than the mid and northeast Atlantic.

With respect to melting from Greenland, yes, Florida will feel a greater impact than regions to the North. But the rate of rise will be less than the global average.

Focusing on the last decade and one tide gauge could be considered cherry-picking the data. Long-term (>60yrs) tide gauges should be used. Virginia Key has only been operational since 1994. Key West Tide gauge has been operational since 1901 and records a rate of sea-level rise of 2.37 mm/yr.

","The hypothesis that (a) the Gulf stream has weakened over this time interval and (b) that it is the primary driver of sea level rise acceleration seen farther north along the U.S. Atlantic coast is still debated (see for example, Kopp 2013)*.

Kopp (2013) Does the mid-Atlantic United States sea level acceleration hot spot reflect ocean dynamic variability?, Geophysical Research Letters","“Can we definitely say it’s the ocean warming?” says Sweet, who has authored several sea-level rise studies. “No. But is it indicative of what we’d expect to see? Yes.”

","It is not yet clear what is causing the recent uptick in the rate of sea level rise in this region over the past several years, which is not similarly recorded at tide gauges north of Cape Hatteras according to the NOAA tide gauge data. If, however, this quote refers to the long-term trend of sea-level rise in this region, then it is correct and consistent with the analysis of the latest IPCC report* (Church and Clark, (2013) Chapter 13, IPCC AR5).

"Analysis of “One of the most troubling ideas about climate change just found new evidence in its favor”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/one-of-the-most-troubling-ideas-about-climate-change-just-found-new-evidence-in-its-favor-chris-mooney-washington-post/,One of the most troubling ideas about climate change just found new evidence in its favor,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/03/27/one-of-the-most-troubling-ideas-about-climate-change-just-found-new-evidence-in-its-favor/,"Ever since 2012, scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather — one that, if it’s correct, would have profound implications across the Northern Hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes, where hundreds of millions of people live.

The idea is that climate change doesn’t merely increase the overall likelihood of heat waves, say, or the volume of rainfall — it also changes the flow of weather itself. By altering massive planet-scale air patterns like the jet stream (pictured above), which flows in waves from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere, a warming planet causes our weather to become more stuck in place. This means that a given weather pattern, whatever it may be, may persist for longer, thus driving extreme droughts, heat waves, downpours and more.

This basic idea has sparked half a decade of criticism and debate, and at the cutting edge of research, scientists continue to grapple with it. And now, a new study once again reinforces one of its core aspects.

Publishing in Nature Scientific Reports, Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University and a group of colleagues at research institutes in the United States, Germany and the Netherlands find that at least in the spring and summer, the large scale flow of the atmosphere is indeed changing in such a way as to cause weather to get stuck more often.

The study, its authors write, “adds to the weight of evidence for a human influence on the occurrence of devastating events such as the 2003 European heat wave, the 2010 Pakistan flood and Russian heat wave, the 2011 Texas heat wave and recent floods in Europe.”

But what does it mean for global warming to alter the jet stream? The basic ideas at play here get complicated fast. The study itself, for instance, refers to “quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) of synoptic-scale waves” as the key mechanism for how researchers believe this is happening — terminology sure to impart terror in nonscientists worldwide.

On the other hand, some of this isn’t all that complicated. The Northern Hemisphere jet stream flows in a wavy pattern from west to east, driven by the rotation of the Earth and the difference in temperature between the equator and the North Pole. The flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large.

But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does — which is part of the fundamental definition of global warming, and which is already happening — the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes.

“It’s sort of like if you confine an electromagnetic wave to a coaxial cable, then you’re not losing energy, it’s being tightly contained in that cable and sent to your television,” said Mann. “These waves aren’t losing energy, so they grow and get larger and get stuck in place as well.”

What the new study is saying is that in summer, in particular, this can occur. Moreover, it finds that a particular temperature pattern is linked to that behavior — and this temperature pattern, featuring an extra warm Arctic, is becoming more frequent over time, based on both observations and also a review of the outputs of high powered climate change models that the researchers conducted.

“We think that the signal has emerged from the noise over the last decade,” said Mann.

One researcher who co-wrote an influential 2012 study suggesting that changes in the Arctic could be driving mid-latitude weather extremes, Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin, praised the new research in an emailed comment Monday. “This study goes beyond statistical correlations and explores a specific process that can plausibly explain how enhanced high-latitude warming trends may trigger remote weather impacts,” he said.

But other scientific authors have expressed considerable skepticism of these kinds of ideas in the past. A recent study in Nature Geoscience, for instance, called into question whether the Arctic’s melting, and in particular its sea ice loss, has been causing winter cooling over Eurasia, another idea that has been swept up in the debate over the jet stream and weather extremes.

One author of that study, John Fyfe of the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis at Environment and Climate Change Canada, remarked of the Mann paper by email: “It is well established that there has been a human influence on the large-scale atmospheric circulation and temperature of the Northern Hemisphere. Mann et al. advance a theory that attempts to link those changes to changes in the spectrum of shorter-scale waves in the atmosphere, which are our weathermakers. I do not believe that this theory is fully developed or that the implications have been fully explored, but I do think that Mann et al.  study is a very good start.”

The current study really only covers weather extremes in the spring and summer. For extremes occurring in winter, Mann said, we need to look to other mechanisms for odd atmospheric behavior. Nonetheless, the work represents yet another suggestion that a changing climate is leading to a changing pattern of atmospheric flow, with major implications for the weather felt by a massive swath of the global population.

Mann, who testifies before Congress this week in a session that is expected to feature a rip-roaring debate about the severity of climate change, commented, “That’s going to be a fake debate. But this stuff is where the real debate is now.”",high,"Accurate, Insightful",185,"This article in The Washington Post discusses a new study related to the hypothesis that global warming is influencing extreme weather events in the midlatitudes by changing the behavior of the jet stream.

While many previous studies have explored statistical correlations, the new study provides a specific process that can plausibly explain how enhanced Arctic warming trends may trigger remote weather impacts. Specifically, it focuses on slow-moving meanders in the jet stream in the spring and summer than can cause extended periods of hot or wet weather.

The scientists who reviewed the article confirm that it is accurate and insightful, and acknowledges the areas where legitimate scientific uncertainty remains.

",,,,,"James Screen, Associate Professor, University of Exeter:","The author does a pretty good job of summarising the state of the science on this topic and the main advance made by the new Mann et al study. It conveys some of the uncertainty and difficulties in attributing changes in the jet strea—and in “stuck” weather patterns—to man-made climate change. It is worth noting that the Mann et al study only claims a climate change effect on the jet stream in summer. However, much of the research referred to in the article is about winter and invokes different physical processes to explain the possible climate change effects on the jet stream. My ranking of “high” rather than “very high” reflects the failure of this piece to fully capture the seasonal nuances of possible connections between climate change and the jet stream.

","Jennifer Francis, Senior Scientist, Woods Hole Research Center
","The new study addresses a very complicated topic in dynamic meteorology and climate science, and this article does an excellent job of explaining the main idea and its implications. It is balanced, accurate, and well written.

","Jim Kossin, Research Scientist, NOAA's Center for Weather and Climate
","Excellent article that should be very informative for a broad audience. There are a few somewhat misleading statements that place too much emphasis on the ongoing debate about how winter storms may be linked to Arctic warming, which are not directly addressed in the new paper by Mann et al. The new results might be inferred indirectly to favor one side of the debate, but this may prove to be incorrect later.","Daniel Swain, Climate Scientist, University of California, Los Angeles
","Overall, this piece accurately describes the findings of a new research paper by Mann et al on linkages between rapid Arctic warming and extreme weather at Earth’s more temperate latitudes. While there are a couple of statements that are overly confident given available evidence in the peer-reviewed literature, the author generally does an excellent job placing this new work into the broader context of related studies over the past decade.

","Christopher Colose, Research Scientist, SciSpace LLC, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
","The relevant framing concerning this work is not in gauging its “credibility,” since the research is sound and at the frontier of our knowledge of the topic. It will not, however, be the last word on the subject.

The subject of how climate change affects mid-latitude weather at the synoptic scale (roughly the scale of ~1000 kilometers, i.e., smaller than the tropical scale circulation such as the Hadley cell, but much larger than a tornado for instance) is complex for a number of reasons.

One reason is that these are some of the “noisiest” regions on the planet, somewhat less so in summer than in winter, but still subject to considerable internal variability. Therefore, for problems at the synoptic scale, it is often the case that initial condition uncertainty is of more importance than the expected forced component. Indeed, it is well known that 50 realizations of weather in a suite of model runs will not be in phase with reality’s weather, but even decadal trends in dynamical aspects of the mid-latitude atmosphere may differ among the 50 individual members of the model ensemble.

","Tim Woollings, Lecturer, University of Oxford:","This article has reported on this story well. The ideas in the new study are interesting, but much more detailed work on this is required in the future. I agree with the quote from John Fyfe that this study is really at the start of something rather than the end. I think climate scientists in general have very diverse views on this theory, but this is well reported in this article.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“The Northern Hemisphere jet stream […] flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large. But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does […] the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes.”

","This is an accurate and succinct description of the primary hypothesized mechanism involved in the Arctic/mid-latitude weather linkage.

",Very nice description for the lay-audience.,,,"“Ever since 2012, scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather — one that, if it’s correct, would have profound implications across the Northern Hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes","This is a somewhat misleading intro. The debate has been focused on winter storms (as Mooney discusses below), and these new results are strictly for boreal summer/spring.",,,,“a warming planet causes our weather to become more stuck in place”,"This claim is somewhat overly confident given the available evidence. Observational studies (e.g. Francis and Vavrus 2015*) do indeed suggest that the “waviness” of the jet stream and subsequently the propensity for weather patterns to become more persistent has increased in certain regions and during certain seasons, although this is not universally true. There is also emerging evidence that the rapid warming of the Arctic may be playing a role in creating the conditions favorable for weather patterns to become “stuck in place”—a hypothesis that the new Mann et al. 2017* paper discussed in the article supports. The connections between amplified Arctic warming and mid-latitude weather extremes remains a very active area of scientific research (Overland et al. 2016*), however, and considerable uncertainty regarding the magnitude and mechanisms of this effect remain.

The study is a step toward physically reconciling a linkage that’s only been described statistically.",,,,"“But other scientific authors have expressed considerable skepticism of these kinds of ideas in the past. A recent study in Nature Geoscience, for instance, called into question whether the Arctic’s melting, and in particular its sea ice loss, has been causing winter cooling over Eurasia, another idea that has been swept up in the debate over the jet stream and weather extremes.”

","Again, the debate has been about Arctic amplification and winter storm behavior, so this is somewhat misleading. It gives the impression that the new study tacitly pushes the debate about the winter storms toward the Francis/Vavrus side.

",,,,"“‘I do not believe that this theory is fully developed or that the implications have been fully explored, but I do think that Mann et al. study is a very good start.’”","I agree with this. There are many competing components involved in how the jet stream will change in the future, and changing pole-to-equator temperature gradients is just one (in fact, the pole-to-equator temperature gradient increases near the tropopause, complicating the physics). Elizabeth Barnes and James Screen have a good essay here that serves as a useful entry point into these complications.

","I disagree that the study is only a beginning. The hypothesis that connects quasi-resonance with summer extreme weather, along with evidence to support it, began with Petoukhov et al (2013)*, which was then expanded upon by Coumou et al (2014)*, Kornhuber et al (2016)*, Petoukhov et al (2016)*, and now Mann et al (2017)*. Clearly there is more to learn, but in my view, we are well down the road to understanding this mechanism and identifying its signature in extreme weather.

Analysis of “Record-breaking climate change pushes world into ‘uncharted territory’”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/analysis-record-breaking-climate-change-pushes-world-uncharted-territory-damian-carrington-guardian/,Record-breaking climate change pushes world into ‘uncharted territory’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/21/record-breaking-climate-change-world-uncharted-territory,"The record-breaking heat that made 2016 the hottest year ever recorded has continued into 2017, pushing the world into “truly uncharted territory”, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.

The WMO’s assessment of the climate in 2016, published on Tuesday, reports unprecedented heat across the globe, exceptionally low ice at both poles and surging sea-level rise.

Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities, but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016. The El Niño is now waning, but the extremes continue to be seen, with temperature records tumbling in the US in February and polar heatwaves pushing ice cover to new lows.

“Even without a strong El Niño in 2017, we are seeing other remarkable changes across the planet that are challenging the limits of our understanding of the climate system. We are now in truly uncharted territory,” said David Carlson, director of the WMO’s world climate research programme.

“Earth is a planet in upheaval due to human-caused changes in the atmosphere,” said Jeffrey Kargel, a glaciologist at the University of Arizona in the US. “In general, drastically changing conditions do not help civilisation, which thrives on stability.”

The WMO report was “startling”, said Prof David Reay, an emissions expert at the University of Edinburgh: “The need for concerted action on climate change has never been so stark nor the stakes so high.”

The new WMO assessment also prompted some scientists to criticise Donald Trump. “While the data show an ever increasing impact of human activities on the climate system, the Trump administration and senior Republicans in Congress continue to bury their heads in the sand,” said Prof Sir Robert Watson, a distinguished climate scientist at the UK’s University of East Anglia and a former head of the UN’s climate science panel.

“Our children and grandchildren will look back on the climate deniers and ask how they could have sacrificed the planet for the sake of cheap fossil fuel energy, when the cost of inaction exceeds the cost of a transition to a low-carbon economy,” Watson said.

Trump is aiming to cut climate change research. But the WMO’s secretary-general Petteri Taalas said: “Continued investment in climate research and observations is vital if our scientific knowledge is to keep pace with the rapid rate of climate change.”

2016 saw the hottest global average among thermometer measurements stretching back to 1880. But scientific research indicates the world was last this warm about 115,000 years ago and that the planet has not experienced such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 4m years.

2017 has seen temperature records continue to tumble, in the US where February was exceptionally warm, and in Australia, where prolonged and extreme heat struck many states. The consequences have been particularly stark at the poles.

“Arctic ice conditions have been tracking at record low conditions since October, persisting for six consecutive months, something not seen before in the [four-decade] satellite data record,” said Prof Julienne Stroeve, at University College London in the UK. “Over in the southern hemisphere, the sea ice also broke new record lows in the seasonal maximum and minimum extents, leading to the least amount of global sea ice ever recorded.”

Emily Shuckburgh, at the British Antarctic Survey, said: “The Arctic may be remote, but changes that occur there directly affect us. The melting of the Greenland ice sheet is already contributing significantly to sea level rise, and new research is highlighting that the melting of Arctic sea ice can alter weather conditions across Europe, Asia and North America.”

Global sea level rise surged between November 2014 and February 2016, with the El Niño event helping the oceans rise by 15mm. That jump would have take five years under the steady rise seen in recent decades, as ice caps melt and oceans get warmer and expand in volume. Final data for 2016 sea level rise have yet to be published.

Climate change harms people most directly by increasing the risk of extreme weather events and the WMO report states that these raised risks can increasingly be calculated. For example, the Arctic heatwaves are made tens of times more likely and the soaring temperatures seen in Australia in February were made twice as likely.

“With levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consistently breaking new records, the influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident,” said Taalas.","high, very_high",Accurate,162,"This article in The Guardian describes a “State of the Global Climate” report for 2016 recently released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

","Overall, the article accurately summarizes key points from the WMO report and places recent record-breaking climate events (such as unprecedented global heat and sea ice loss) into reasonable longer-term context.

","James Renwick, Professor, Victoria University of Wellington
","An excellent summary, mostly based on a report from the authoritative World Meteorological Organization. Some of the discussion (such as around sea level rise) cuts a few corners.

","Michael Henehan, Postdoctoral Researcher, GFZ Helmholtz Centre Potsdam
","In general, the article is scientifically accurate and does not misrepresent things, although to be critical, given the title and angle of the piece it might be better to focus more on observational data and measurements from 2017, rather than citing many observations from 2016. Another possible criticism is that the piece also relies heavily on quotes and opinions from scientists rather than objective datasets or new graphic representations of those datasets. There aren’t many of the measurements that the WMO have cited included in the report, for example.

","Aimée Slangen, Researcher, Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ)

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities, but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016.”
","Yes, as stated in the last IPCC report, human emissions of greenhouse gases have been the dominant driver of climate change since the mid-20th century. No other changes (such as the output of the Sun) can adequately explain the observed warming.",,,,"“But scientific research indicates the world was last this warm about 115,000 years ago and that the planet has not experienced such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 4m years.”","This statement is overly confident and not based on a broad consensus in the literature. Even the cited study states “we cannot be certain that the current year is warmer than any single year earlier in the Holocene due to centennial smoothing of the Holocene stack and original resolution of the underlying proxy records”. The most recent IPCC assessment indicates only moderate confidence that 1983-2012 was the warmest 30-year period in the last 1,400 years and limited this to the Northern Hemisphere rather than the global average.

","Actually, some of the more recent estimates* have suggested that we may have crossed over the 400 ppm threshold briefly as recently as 2.4 million years ago, and again at 2.9 million years ago. (see Martinez-Boti et al.*). I think climate scientists typically think of the Pliocene (between about 5.3 and 2.6 million years ago) as being the last time period where CO2 may have been more or less permanently above the 400 ppm threshold though, so perhaps this is what they are referring to here. It might be advisable to tidy up the terminology a little here nonetheless.

Martinez-Boti et al (2015), Plio-Pleistocene climate sensitivity evaluated using high-resolution CO2 records, Nature
","At the last interglacial period 115,000 years ago, increased solar intensity was responsible for the added warmth, but today’s high CO2 was last seen in the atmosphere 3-5 million years ago. At that time, global mean temperatures were a couple of degrees higher than present, and sea levels were several metres higher than present.

",,"“‘With levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consistently breaking new records, the influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident,’ said Taalas.”

","Readers should also be aware of the decades-long lag between the stabilization of CO2 in the atmosphere and the stabilization of CO2-induced warming. The planet will continue to heat because ocean temperatures will not yet be in equilibrium with the atmosphere.

",,,,"“El Niño is now waning, but the extremes continue to be seen, with temperature records tumbling in the US in February and polar heatwaves pushing ice cover to new lows.”

“If water temperatures stay moderate, the damaged sections of the Great Barrier Reef may be covered with corals again in as few as 10 or 15 years”","The El Niño pattern of sea surface temperatures waned quite a long time ago, with neutral conditions by mid-2016. The effects of the El Niño on the atmosphere persisted through the year, though.

","The fact that numerous high temperature and low sea ice records are still being exceeded in 2017, despite the lack of El Niño conditions in the Pacific Ocean, is indeed a testament to the increasingly strong human fingerprint upon global weather and climate events.

","This is especially striking in the Antarctic where sea ice extent has been increasing gradually for many years. We are now seeing historic lows in sea ice extent.

","Decreasing sea ice extent has been mostly observed in the Arctic, but now also the Antarctic is showing declining sea ice extent. See this page for up to date observed sea ice extent and area.
","“‘Arctic ice conditions have been tracking at record low conditions since October, persisting for six consecutive months’”","Yes, this is supported by the observations, available at the NSIDC website.

",,,,"“‘The Arctic may be remote, but changes that occur there directly affect us. The melting of the Greenland ice sheet is already contributing significantly to sea level rise, and new research is highlighting that the melting of Arctic sea ice can alter weather conditions across Europe, Asia and North America.’”","There is indeed observational evidence that melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which contributes to global sea level rise, has accelerated in recent years. While scientists are still intensively investigating the details, it is also true that recent research* suggests that the loss of Arctic sea ice will mostly likely influence weather patterns in mid-latitude regions (including much of Europe, Asia, and North America).

Some of the physical impacts are estimated through projections which may be imperfect. There is large disagreement about what discount rate to use to value future climate damages1. Many of the consequences are simply hard to translate in monetary terms (non-market impacts). Some of the impacts may be nonlinear.

"Analysis of “Large Sections of Australia’s Great Reef Are Now Dead, Scientists Find”",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/great-barrier-reef-coral-climate-change-dieoff-the-new-york-times-damien-cave-justin-gillis/,"Large Sections of Australia’s Great Reef Are Now Dead, Scientists Find",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/science/great-barrier-reef-coral-climate-change-dieoff.html,"SYDNEY, Australia — The Great Barrier Reef in Australia has long been one of the world’s most magnificent natural wonders, so enormous it can be seen from space, so beautiful it can move visitors to tears.

But the reef, and the profusion of sea creatures living near it, are in profound trouble.

Huge sections of the Great Barrier Reef, stretching across hundreds of miles of its most pristine northern sector, were recently found to be dead, killed last year by overheated seawater. More southerly sections around the middle of the reef that barely escaped then are bleaching now, a potential precursor to another die-off that could rob some of the reef’s most visited areas of color and life.

“We didn’t expect to see this level of destruction to the Great Barrier Reef for another 30 years,” said Terry P. Hughes, director of a government-funded center for coral reef studies at James Cook University in Australia and the lead author of a paper on the reef that is being published Thursday as the cover article of the journal Nature. “In the north, I saw hundreds of reefs — literally two-thirds of the reefs were dying and are now dead.”

The damage to the Great Barrier Reef, one of the world’s largest living structures, is part of a global calamity that has been unfolding intermittently for nearly two decades and seems to be intensifying. In the paper, dozens of scientists described the recent disaster as the third worldwide mass bleaching of coral reefs since 1998, but by far the most widespread and damaging.

The state of coral reefs is a telling sign of the health of the seas. Their distress and death are yet another marker of the ravages of global climate change.

If most of the world’s coral reefs die, as scientists fear is increasingly likely, some of the richest and most colorful life in the ocean could be lost, along with huge sums from reef tourism. In poorer countries, lives are at stake: Hundreds of millions of people get their protein primarily from reef fish, and the loss of that food supply could become a humanitarian crisis.

With this latest global bleaching in its third year, reef scientists say they have no doubt as to the responsible party.

They warned decades ago that the coral reefs would be at risk if human society kept burning fossil fuels at a runaway pace, releasing greenhouse gases that warm the ocean. Emissions continued to rise, and now the background ocean temperature is high enough that any temporary spike poses a critical risk to reefs.

“Climate change is not a future threat,” Professor Hughes said. “On the Great Barrier Reef, it’s been happening for 18 years.”

Corals require warm water to thrive, but they are exquisitely sensitive to extra heat. Just two or three degrees Fahrenheit of excess warming can sometimes kill the tiny creatures.

Globally, the ocean has warmed by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, by a conservative calculation, and a bit more in the tropics, home to many reefs. An additional kick was supplied by an El Niño weather pattern that peaked in 2016 and temporarily warmed much of the surface of the planet, causing the hottest year in a historical record dating to 1880.

It was obvious last year that the corals on many reefs were likely to die, but now formal scientific assessments are coming in. The paper in Nature documents vast coral bleaching in 2016 along a 500-mile section of the reef north of Cairns, a city on Australia’s eastern coast.

Bleaching indicates that corals are under heat stress, but they do not always die and cooler water can help them recover. Subsequent surveys of the Great Barrier Reef, conducted late last year after the deadline for inclusion in the Nature paper, documented that extensive patches of reef had in fact died, and would not be likely to recover soon, if at all.

Professor Hughes led those surveys. He said that he and his students cried when he showed them maps of the damage, which he had calculated in part by flying low in small planes and helicopters.

His aerial surveys, combined with underwater measurements, found that 67 percent of the corals had died in a long stretch north of Port Douglas, and in patches, the mortality reached 83 percent.

By luck, a storm stirred the waters in the central and southern parts of the reef at a critical moment, cooling them, and mortality there was much lower — about 6 percent in a stretch off Townsville, and even lower in the southernmost part of the reef.

But an Australian government study released last week found that over all, last year brought “the highest sea surface temperatures across the Great Barrier Reef on record.”

Only 9 percent of the reef has avoided bleaching since 1998, Professor Hughes said, and now, the less remote, more heavily visited stretch from Cairns south is in trouble again. Water temperatures there remain so high that another round of mass bleaching is underway, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority confirmed last week.

Professor Hughes said he hoped the die-off this time would not be as serious as last year’s, but “back-to-back bleaching is unheard-of in Australia.” The central and southern part of the reef had already been badly damaged by human activities like dredging and pollution.

The Australian government has tried to combat these local threats with its Reef 2050 plan, restricting port development, dredging and agricultural runoff, among other risks. But Professor Hughes’s research found that, given the high temperatures, these national efforts to improve water quality were not enough.

“The reefs in muddy water were just as fried as those in pristine water,” Professor Hughes said. “That’s not good news in terms of what you can do locally to prevent bleaching — the answer to that is not very much at all. You have to address climate change directly.”

With the election of Donald J. Trump as the American president, a recent global deal to tackle the problem, known as the Paris Agreement, seems to be in peril. Australia’s conservative government also continues to support fossil fuel development, including what many scientists and conservationists see as the reef’s most immediate threat — a proposed coal mine, expected to be among the world’s largest, to be built inland from the reef by the Adani Group, a conglomerate based in India.

“The fact is, Australia is the largest coal exporter in the world, and the last thing we should be doing to our greatest national asset is making the situation worse,” said Imogen Zethoven, campaign director for the Australian Marine Conservation Society.

Australia relies on the Great Barrier Reef for about 70,000 jobs and billions of dollars annually in tourism revenue, and it is not yet clear how that economy will be affected by the reef’s deterioration. Even in hard-hit areas, large patches of the Great Barrier Reef survived, and guides will most likely take tourists there, avoiding the dead zones.

The global reef crisis does not necessarily mean extinction for coral species. The corals may save themselves, as many other creatures are attempting to do, by moving toward the poles as the Earth warms, establishing new reefs in cooler water.

But the changes humans are causing are so rapid, by geological standards, that it is not entirely clear that coral species will be able to keep up. And even if the corals do survive, that does not mean individual reefs will continue to thrive where they do now.

Coral reefs are sensitive systems, built by unusual animals. The corals themselves are tiny polyps that act like farmers, capturing colorful single-celled plants called algae that convert sunlight into food. The coral polyps form colonies and build a limestone scaffolding on which to live — a reef.

But when the water near a reef gets too hot, the algae begin producing toxins, and the corals expel them in self-defense, turning ghostly white. If water temperatures drop soon enough, the corals can grow new algae and survive, but if not, they may succumb to starvation or disease.

Even when the corals die, some reefs eventually recover. If water temperatures stay moderate, the damaged sections of the Great Barrier Reef may be covered with corals again in as few as 10 or 15 years.

But the temperature of the ocean is now high enough that global mass bleaching events seem to be growing more frequent. If they become routine, many of the world’s hard-hit coral reefs may never be able to re-establish themselves.

Within a decade, certain kinds of branching and plate coral could be extinct, reef scientists say, along with a variety of small fish that rely on them for protection from predators.

“I don’t think the Great Barrier Reef will ever again be as great as it used to be — at least not in our lifetimes,” said C. Mark Eakin, a reef expert with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in Silver Spring, Md.

Dr. Eakin was an author of the new paper and heads a program called Coral Reef Watch, producing predictive maps to warn when coral bleaching is imminent. Even though last year’s El Niño has ended, water temperatures are high enough that his maps are showing continued hot water across millions of square miles of the ocean.

Kim M. Cobb, a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the writing of the new paper, described it and the more recent findings as accurate, and depressing. She said she saw extensive coral devastation last year off Kiritimati Island, part of the Republic of Kiribati several thousand miles from Australia and a place she visits regularly in her research.

With the international effort to fight climate change at risk of losing momentum, “ocean temperatures continue to march upward,” Dr. Cobb said. “The idea that we’re going to have 20 or 30 years before we reach the next bleaching and mortality event for the corals is basically a fantasy.”",very_high,Accurate,176,"The New York Times published an article on coral bleaching and mortality in the Australian Great Barrier Reef and the influence of climate change. Scientists who reviewed the article deemed it largely accurate. While last year saw a record bleaching event that ended up damaging a record number of corals in the region. Severe bleaching has continued for a second consecutive year, which is unprecedented. While natural temperature fluctuations (due to El Niño, for example) have always occurred, they are now superimposed on a warmer background due to human-induced global warming. That causes mass coral bleaching to happen more frequently.

Under a business-as-usual scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, coral reef ecosystems are expected to undergo major losses as their slow development and habitat requirements prevents fast migration towards cooler regions.

","This is an important article that relates the latest science. Even though people may find it shocking, we are facing a serious downward trend in the world’s largest continuous coral reef system.
","Overall, this was an accurate article. There were three sentences that was just a tad off—to be clear, these are minor quibbles (see below).

","This is a very common misconception even among scientists. The warming, bleaching, and coral loss is 100% due to greenhouse gas emissions, not the ENSO cycle and the fact that we were in a peak of the El Niño phase in early 2016. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced El Niño events for thousands of years, yet bleaching wasn’t observed there until 1998 when ocean warming pushed ocean temperatures just above the bleaching threshold.

",,,,"“The global reef crisis does not necessarily mean extinction for coral species. The corals may save themselves, as many other creatures are attempting to do, by moving toward the poles as the Earth warms, establishing new reefs in cooler water.”

","Minor quibble: the article mentions corals potentially migrating towards the poles. While coral species may spread poleward as the ocean warms, it takes many years for the reef structure to grow, thus the habitat for other reef species may not be easily recreated.

","This is rather overstated. While some weedy species may migrate poleward, studies have shown that corals cannot move to much higher latitude due to other factors, such as the light corals require for photosynthesis and skeletal growth. Higher latitude corals will also be restricted to shallow water where they are more susceptible to cold stress.

"Analysis of “Why are climate-change models so flawed? Because climate science is so incomplete”

Because climate science is so incomplete,https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/columns/2017/03/14/why-are-climate-change-models-flawed-because-climate-science-incomplete/hekwjPBTScRpFyXaXnrWhI/story.html,"Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.”

It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that.

Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.

There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete.

Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8.

Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism.

The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision.

But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record?

Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering.",very_low,"Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",1086,"An article by Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby argues that climate science is too “incomplete” to determine whether human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide could be responsible for global warming. The column defended US EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s recent statement that he “would not agree that [human activity is] a primary contributor to the global warming that we see”—a statement scientists reviewed and found to be incorrect.

Scientists who analyzed Jacoby’s column found that it is inaccurate, misleading, and uses flawed reasoning to support its central claims. In reality, CO2’s role in the climate system is well understood, and this fundamental knowledge informs the determinations that humans are responsible for modern climate change, and that continued greenhouse gas emissions will cause further warming.

",,,,,"James Screen, Associate Professor, University of Exeter:",This is a highly inaccurate article that makes a number of false and intentionally misleading claims. The weight of scientific evidence (summarised in the IPCC reports) shows that greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of observed global warming. The claim that climate models “always predict far more warming” is demonstrably false. The discussion of complexity is intended to mislead: the fact that the climate system is incredibly complex does not mean we don’t understand key aspects of how it functions.,"Mitch Lyle, Professor, Sr. Research, Oregon State University

",,,,,,,,,,,"“CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent.”","First, it is true that water vapor constitutes the bulk of Earth’s present-day greenhouse effect (measured in terms of infrared absorption). Quantitatively, however, Jacoby is off by quite a bit. In fact, water vapor constitutes ~50% of the terrestrial greenhouse effect, not 95% (see here*). Clouds (solid and liquid water that form when the vapor condenses) constitute another ~25%, but CO2 contributes to almost all of the remaining fraction (only ~5% or so from all of the other combined gases). This is because CO2 still absorbs well in spectral regions where water vapor doesn’t, and also because the upper troposphere is very dry; the ability to absorb intense surface emission and re-emit it at colder, higher layers of the atmosphere is critical for the maintenance of a planetary greenhouse effect.

Secondly, the water vapor greenhouse effect is not independent of the CO2 in the atmosphere.
Jacoby stresses that CO2 is only a trace component of the atmosphere, an argument that is irritatingly unoriginal and provides useless context when describing the flow of radiation through the atmosphere. As before, CO2 accounts for ~20% of Earth’s greenhouse effect. N2 and O2 account for nearly all of Earth’s atmospheric mass. However, if the atmosphere were purely N2 and O2, the planet would likely be in a snowball state due to the lack of greenhouse trapping. This is where the equations of radiative transfer must be applied, rather than a naive intuition about proportions.

Schmidt et al (2010) Attribution of the present-day total greenhouse effect, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres.
","Another helpful quote comes from this article:

“The contribution of CO2 to the greenhouse effect, considerable though it is, understates the central role of the gas as a controller of climate. The atmosphere, if CO2 were removed from it, would cool enough that much of the water vapor would rain out. That precipitation, in turn, would cause further cooling and ultimately spiral Earth into a globally glaciated snowball state. It is only the present of CO2 that keeps Earth’s atmosphere warm enough to contain much water vapor.”

I like to think of CO2 as analogous to a military commander and water vapor as analogous to an army of foot soldiers. Even though the water vapor foot soldiers do most of the fighting, the CO2 commander sends the army to battle.

","While it is true that carbon dioxide constitutes about 400 ppm (or 0.04%) of the atmosphere, the implication that this means it is insignificant in Earth’s climate is incorrect. It is the ability of a gas to absorb radiation, and so affect energy balance of the Earth, not its concentration, which is important. This effect on Earth’s energy balance can be quantified by the radiative forcing (RF); a positive RF means a surface warming effect and a negative RF a cooling. The figure below, from the 2013 IPCC report shows estimates of RF for a range of factors which have influenced climate from 1750-2011. As can be seen, increasing carbon dioxide concentrations have the largest RF and therefore the largest impact on climate.

I also stress that knowledge of the important role of carbon dioxide (despite its low concentration) in Earth’s climate is not new, and dates back to the work of Tyndall, Arrhenius, and others in the 19th century.",,"“Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.”","Jacoby emphasizes the logarithmic nature of how CO2 affects the energy balance of Earth, and hence surface temperature (i.e., going from 10 ppm of CO2 to 11 ppm would have a much larger impact than going from 300 to 301 ppm). This is correct, but has been known for well over half a century now, and is fully accounted for in even simple estimates of future warming. This is therefore a distraction.

","The effects of CO2 do not decrease sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. The radiative effects of CO2 are logarithmic, so they increase slightly less the higher CO2 gets but they don’t decrease sharply.

","This is flawed reasoning as it is not a sensible analogy for how the greenhouse effect works. The science is more complex:

Namely, radiation from the surface at a warmer temperature is absorbed in the layers above which are at a colder temperature; the colder layers emit less radiation so that there is a net loss of radiative energy escaping to space from the atmosphere-surface system as a whole, but coming about due to the “exchange” as formulated. This is true in absorption bands that are transparent and not opaque—i.e., in bands that are not saturated. In bands that are opaque, the radiation emanating from the layer to space represents a “cooling-to-space” and this too represents a “trapping”. In this regard, the lapse-rate and decrease of temperature with height (in the troposphere) are important. The more CO2 that is added to the atmosphere, the more heat that is “trapped” in the climate system, although it is not 1:1 and is instead a logarithmic relationship. However, regardless of the rate, we still have more warming with more CO2—that is unequivocally true.

","Jacoby links to a blog page which explains the logarithmic relationship of CO2 concentrations and radiative forcing. Contrary to Jacoby’s implication, this is actually a well accepted part of climate science. For instance, see Myhre et al 1998* (table 3), who give detailed estimates of this logarithmic relationship.

However, as CO2 concentrations rise, the fraction of CO2 which remains in the atmosphere (rather than being absorbed by the ocean) is projected to increase (see Jones et al 2013*). The net effect is that the relationship between total CO2 emissions and surface temperature is almost linear. See the figure below from the 2013 IPCC report.

","“There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a ‘positive feedback loop.’ But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred”

","[John Fyfe was the first author of the paper linked by Jacoby to support this claim]

The statement “climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred” is false.

Climate models reproduced the observed record of global average temperature rise since the middle of the 20th Century. It is true that climate models overestimated the observed rate of warming over the early-21st Century but this was not unexpected. Over this period, and due to a well-known natural fluctuation in the climate system, temperatures over much of the tropical Pacific were cooler than normal. These ocean temperatures have warmed significantly over the past few years. Climate models represent these natural fluctuations in the climate system but do not – by design – reproduce the observed timing except by chance. This is the primary reason why climate models overestimated the rate of global average temperature rise over the early-21st Century.

","Jacoby discusses the so-called water vapor feedback, in which warming caused by CO2 (or anything) results in more water vapor in the atmosphere, increasing heating. However, his discussion is confused.

First, models are not based on a water vapor feedback. Such a feedback is result, not an assumption. There is no FORTRAN code written that tells a model to increase the water vapor concentration when the CO2 is going up. However, there is incredibly well-established thermodynamics assuring us that a warmer atmosphere can theoretically hold more water vapor.

This doesn’t mean it will—after all, deserts are very hot, but not very moist. This is because atmospheric dynamics (especially the rising and sinking motions of air) keep most of Earth’s atmosphere beneath its maximum vapor holding capacity. However, it turns out that observations and complex models (as well as more simple theoretical work) suggest that this degree of “subsaturation” (or relative humidity) doesn’t change much, so the actual water vapor concentration still goes up in a similar way that it would if it just behaved like a simple thermodynamic equation (see e.g., here and here and here)*. Indeed, this has been a robust result going back to at least the 1960s in observational and model-based syntheses of the problem, and is now very well understood.

Indeed, CO2 is the fundamental control knob on Earth’s climate over relatively long timescales, since the water vapor concentration is shackled to temperature in a very fundamental way, because the Sun’s output does not change very much except on geologic time intervals, and because CO2 is the principle non-condensing greenhouse gas capable of changing in response to geologic (or anthropogenic) sources and sinks on climate timescales.

","The water vapor feedback, which is referred to here as “creation of water vapor” but in fact is higher water vapor in a warmer atmosphere, is a basic prediction of thermodynamics, one of the most well-tested branches of physics. Water vapor has been observed to increase*. So, there is nothing speculative about it.

The claim that climate models have consistently failed is false. In fact, the contrary is true. Climate model projections from the 1980s have essentially come true. For a recent example see Stouffer and Manabe (2017)*.

","All available evidence suggests that the atmosphere maintains nearly constant relative humidity, meaning that the absolute concentration of water vapor increases exponentially with temperature. The exponential increase is grounded in fundamental physics known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

A particularly clever test of the amplifying water vapor feedback was conducted in response to the Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991*. If there were no amplifying water vapor feedback, then the global cooling in response to the volcanic eruption would have been much smaller than observed.

","“The science is far from settled.”

","The basic controls on the climate, sunlight and greenhouse gases, have been understood for over a century and are not disputed. The frontiers of climate research are where the debates lie, as with any branch of science.

",,,,“[Pruitt’s statement] was an accurate and judicious answer”,"Ilissa Ocko, Climate Scientist, Environmental Defense Fund:
It is objectively not an accurate answer and is misleading at best. [Pruitt’s statement has been reviewed by scientists with Climate Feedback and found to be incorrect.]

While it is certainly challenging to determine human influence on the climate, decades of research by tens of thousands of scientists from different institutions all over the world have yielded a nearly unanimous consensus with extreme confidence that humans are the dominant cause of climate change. In fact, scientists have been questioning and researching human influence on the climate for nearly 200 years. Further, we can use techniques similar to the smoking-cancer causality research to prove that humans are mainly responsible and to show that carbon dioxide is the primary control knob for today’s climate change. There is no “tremendous disagreement” or “debate” about this.",,,,"“Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. […] The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8.”

","Yes, it is complex, but not unfathomable. The basics are simple—the energy budget at Earth’s surface is controlled by the intensity of sunlight reaching the ground and the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. That’s it.

This analogy implies everything is happening randomly in the climate system. This is not the case. There is a great deal of structure imposed by the laws of fluid motion and energy transfer, and by the basic geometry and rotation rate of the Earth.

","The Earth system is indeed complex with nonlinear interactions between various components on a large range of time and spatial scales. However, some processes are very robust, such as the response of the global energy budget to increased greenhouse gases, so that the surface of the Earth eventually has to warm up in order to reach a radiative balance. The distribution of the heating, the rate of melting of the ice sheets, the changes in the occurrence of extremes, etc. are more difficult to predict and that is why we need state-of-the art global climate models. Last, one should not confuse the weather prediction of an exact meteorological state, limited by the chaotic nature of the system, and climate projections of the statistics of variables in response to forcing, such as the global mean surface temperature sensitivity to greenhouse gases emissions.",,,"“The list of variables that shape climate […] would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision.”

","Jacoby is making a laundry list, not trying to understand the issues. He is also confusing the issue by trying to claim that since scientists cannot predict climate change at a given small location at a fixed point in future time that they do not have the ability to generally predict the the future trend. Climate scientists are after the trend.

Most of the variables he mentions cause the local climate to deviate to a small extent from the trend. Some, like volcanic activity or El Niño, affect the climate for a small number of years, and then their effect disappears.

","The basic argument in the remainder of the article is one of “complexity” and the notion that climatologists cannot perfectly understand thousands of variables, and hence the behavior of the system under investigation.

Jacoby is not completely wrong—climate is extremely complex, and poses no shortage of interesting research questions.
However, it is sometimes difficult for non-specialists to appreciate the emergent simplicity that can arise in an incredibly complex system. After all, how do we know summer will be warmer than winter, that the top of Mt. Everest is colder than the base, or that Arizona is expected to be on average drier than Florida, or that the equator ought to be hotter than New York, or that the climate will cool following a large volcanic eruption?

These statements are not just based on prior observations, but in fact can be predicted by applying fundamental equations to a rotating planet. Part of the beauty in studying atmospheric science is in gaining an appreciation for where complexity is counterbalanced by an almost eerie predictability, much like how the outcome of a single spin in roulette is hopelessly unpredictable (and certainly influenced by every slight detail at the time the dealer releases the ball), but casinos have no problem with such complexity because the statistical behavior of the roulette wheel is well-posed. Similarly, the statistical behavior of the atmosphere, while unsolved, is not actually that complex.

The appeal to complexity is a compelling one. Nonetheless, progress has been made in many complex sciences (astrophysics, geology) in which the system under investigation cannot be experimentally isolated, and yet where so much is known.

However, it turns out to be incredibly simple to rule out El Niño, volcanic eruptions, soil quality, sunspot cycles, plate tectonics, etc. to the trend in global temperatures since 1950. Just as geologists can inform you of the glacial history of a region, sometimes with little more than a trained eye, CO2 leaves behind “fingerprints” in the atmospheric warming that other “forcing agents” do not.

Another perhaps surprising component is that this result is not extremely sensitive to unknown variables. Suppose, for example, that the Andes Mountains were abruptly flattened. This would almost certainly affect important aspects of the global and regional climate, but many of the critical phenomena of the climate system (e.g. that the equator is wet where air rises, that storm tracks develop in the mid-latitudes, the presence of a jet stream, etc.) would still remain. Furthermore, adding CO2 to a “flat-Andes hypothetical Earth” would still result in warming. It’s physics, and it’s unavoidable.

It is true that the exact magnitude of future warming, even if we knew future carbon emissions perfectly, is still not known to within even 10%. However, that uncertainty range does not overlap with “very little warming” or “make the planet uninhabitable warming.” In any case, if one’s argument is based on how complex the system is, surely perturbing that complex system is not something they ought to advocate for!

",,,"“What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.)”

","Again, this assumes that all variables are independent and everything is happening randomly. This is just not the case. Winds, temperatures, pressures, cloud formation, and so on are all bound together in coherent ways by the laws of physics.

","This is absolutely not how prediction skills are and should be measured. Assuming that each variable is given the same weight, the initial error would be of 5%. How this error grows with the prediction is a nontrivial problem, which cannot be explained by kindergarten probabilities, but requires observations, theory and modeling. Moreover, the problem of the predictability of fast weather fluctuations become irrelevant for long-term climate projections of statistics in response to forcing.

",,,"“Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record?”

","One way we can evaluate climate models is their ability to simulate past observed climate changes. The following figure from the 2013 IPCC report shows that they in fact have a good track record in capturing climate change over past century.

"Analysis of “Scientists: Here’s What Really Causes Climate Change (And It Has Nothing To Do With Human Beings)”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-we-know-what-really-causes-climate-james-barrett-the-daily-wire/,Scientists: Here’s What Really Causes Climate Change (And It Has Nothing To Do With Human Beings),http://www.dailywire.com/news/13817/scientists-we-know-what-really-causes-climate-james-barrett,"Anew study produced by a University of Wisconsin-Madison geoscientist and Northwestern astrophysicist presents an explanation of the fluctuations of the earth's temperatures that global warming alarmists are going to make sure to bury: The cycle of changes in the climate over the millennia is a result of changes in the amount of solar radiation, in part caused by small changes in the orbits of Earth and Mars. 

While the notion that the impact on earth's orbital cycle on solar radiation levels is the most significant factor determining global temperatures is anything but new, the team of scientists seem to have tied the phenomenon to planetary orbits in a more concrete manner than previous studies.

In an article summarizing the scientists' findings, which were originally published this week in the journal Nature, the University of Wisconsin-Madison notes that the study ""provides the first hard proof for what scientists call the 'chaotic solar system,' a theory proposed in 1989 to account for small variations in the present conditions of the solar system."" Those variations over millions of years ""produce big changes in our planet’s climate."" Not only does the new discovery promise to provide a better understanding of ""the mechanics of the solar system,"" but also ""a better understanding of the link between orbital variations and climate change over geologic time scales.""

UW-M provides some more details on the groundbreaking study:

Using evidence from alternating layers of limestone and shale laid down over millions of years in a shallow North American seaway at the time dinosaurs held sway on Earth, the team led by UW–Madison Professor of Geoscience Stephen Meyers and Northwestern University Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences Brad Sageman discovered the 87 million-year-old signature of a “resonance transition” between Mars and Earth. A resonance transition is the consequence of the “butterfly effect” in chaos theory. It plays on the idea that small changes in the initial conditions of a nonlinear system can have large effects over time.

In the context of the solar system, the phenomenon occurs when two orbiting bodies periodically tug at one another, as occurs when a planet in its track around the sun passes in relative proximity to another planet in its own orbit. These small but regular ticks in a planet’s orbit can exert big changes on the location and orientation of a planet on its axis relative to the sun and, accordingly, change the amount of solar radiation a planet receives over a given area. Where and how much solar radiation a planet gets is a key driver of climate.

Over the ages, the subtle variations in the orbits of Earth and Mars, the scientists theorize, have impacted the amount of Earth's exposure to solar radiation and thus led to shifts in global temperatures and impacting the pattern of Earth's ice ages.  

""The impact of astronomical cycles on climate can be quite large,"" explains Meyers, noting as an example the pacing of the Earth’s ice ages, which have been reliably matched to periodic changes in the shape of Earth’s orbit, and the tilt of our planet on its axis.

While evidence that the earth's orbital variations impact radiation levels and thus global temperatures does not of course mean that man is not in some way impacting the climate, studies like these highlight that the role man plays on the planet is dwarfed by natural phenomena utterly out of our control.","low, very_low","Flawed reasoning, Inappropriate sources, Misleading",162,"This post at The Daily Wire, which has been widely shared on Facebook, claims that a recent study of variations in Earth’s orbit recorded by 90 million-year-old rocks provides evidence against a human cause of current global warming.

Scientists who reviewed the post found that it misrepresented the study’s implications for modern climate change, as well as the timeframes that the study is relevant to. In reality, the gradual cycles in Earth’s orbit are much too slow to be responsible for the warming of the last couple centuries. Climate research has shown that these orbital changes and other natural factors do not explain modern warming.

All the reviewers also indicate that the title of the article is not supported by its content.

","Although the main body of the article may be a fair description of a scientific paper, the conclusion that anthropogenic climate change is dwarfed by natural variations is extremely misleading and certainly not in the original paper.

","Georg Feulner, Senior Scientist, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)

","It’s strange how research into how planets orbit within our solar system has ended up being used to downplay the anthropogenic role in climate change.

The incorrect link to completely different research in the Nature journal about ice-ages betrays this confusion.","Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Senior researcher, KNMI (The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute)
","The article misuses a Nature article on a geological process 90 millions years ago to argue the warming of the past century is not anthropogenic. It seems the reasoning is ideologically motivated rather than based on reality.

However, the rise in temperature of 1 degree Celsius over the last two hundred years is not on a geological time scale, and is not caused by natural phenomena out of our control as suggested here. Both from the negative (there are no natural forcings on the climate that would have produced such heating over the last century) and from the positive (the heating is pretty much what we expect from greenhouse gases minus aerosols) the evidence is very strong that humans are responsible for most of the trend over the last 100 years.

","I’m not sure how they come to this conclusion. The increase in global temperature from the depth of the last glacial (22,000 years ago) to preindustrial times is about 4.5°C. This is less than the warming projected for the end of the century, if we choose to ignore man’s responsibility as the author suggests. Clearly if we do act to limit the warming to 2°C, then the glacial change would be bigger than it, but the timespans involved mean that current climate change is still a happening at a faster rate.",,,"“[…]an explanation of the fluctuations of the earth’s temperatures that global warming alarmists are going to make sure to bury: The cycle of changes in the climate over the millennia is a result of changes in the amount of solar radiation, in part caused by small changes in the orbits of Earth and Mars.”

Analysis of “Here’s why it’s so frickin’ hot right now”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/heres-why-its-so-frickin-hot-right-now-andrew-freedman-mashable/,Here’s why it’s so frickin’ hot right now,https://mashable.com/2017/02/23/february-heat-records/#jiOh71fxV5qc,"There's something about a warm February day that reminds you that something just isn't right. It gives you that nagging feeling that maybe global warming is real after all.

February 2017 has featured prolonged warm weather the likes of which many areas have not seen before, or have only experienced on rare occasions.

Taken as a whole, the month-to-date in the U.S. has seen a ridiculously lopsided ratio of daily record highs to daily record lows, which is a key indicator of short-term weather variability and, over the longer term, human-caused climate change.

For individual days' worth of warm weather, you mainly have the jet stream to thank. This current of fast-moving air at about 35,000 feet above the ground has been steering a never-ending series storms into the West Coast, where California's mountains have picked up a crazy 500 inches of snow so far, and then moved across the U.S. in a way that has cut off flow of frigid air from the Arctic.

While transient weather variability is playing a key role here, the widespread record warmth across the U.S. so far this year is part of a long-term trend toward more warm temperature records versus cold ones.

This February offers a vivid illustration of this trend.

Through Feb. 23, daily record highs have been blowing away daily record lows by a far greater than 100-to-1 ratio, which, if it holds for a few more days, would itself set a record. So far this month, there have been nearly 5,000 daily record highs set or tied, compared to just 42 daily record lows. (Although this records ratio might need an asterisk, considering the short calendar month.)

And it's not the daily records that are most impressive, but rather the number of monthly records that are being tied or broken from the Gulf Coast all the way to the Midwest and northeastward into Canada. During the past week alone (not including Feb. 23), there were 736 daily record highs set or tied in the U.S., compared to zero daily record lows for the same period.

Even more startling is the number of record warm overnight temperatures set or tied in the past seven days, which total a whopping 940. There were no record cold overnight low temperatures set or tied during the same period.

And the monthly records, which are far harder to break than daily milestones, are astounding.

According to the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) in Asheville, North Carolina, February has seen 336 monthly record highs set or tied, along with 203 records set or tied for the warmest overnight minimum temperature. In comparison, there was not a single monthly cold temperature record set or tied through Feb. 23.

These figures do not include monthly temperature records that were broken on Friday, which included 73 degrees in Boston, shattering the previous record by 3 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, Allentown, Pennsylvania hit a remarkable 77 degrees, and Binghamton, New York reached 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Dayton, Cincinatti and Columbus Ohio each either tied or broke their monthly high temperature records on Friday as well, with numerous monthly milestones set on Thursday, too.

In Albany, New York, the high temperature of 74 degrees on Thursday was the warmest temperature on record for any day during the months of December, January and February.

On Wednesday, the record warmth was centered across the Midwest, where the three major cities in Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Madison and Green Bay), all saw temperatures hit record highs for not just February, but for any month during meteorological winter, which encompasses the months of December, January and February.

Milwaukee, for example, broke its monthly all-time record high for February when the temperature reached 71 degrees Fahrenheit, and Madison set a monthly record with a high of 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

In Ottumwa, Iowa, where the ground would normally be snow-covered this time of year, the high on Wednesday was 79 degrees, which set a monthly record as well. Some cities set records for the longest stretch of February warmth they've seen, including Kansas City, which set a seven-day February warmth record on Wednesday, according to weather.com.

On Monday, Chicago had a high temperature of 70 degrees, which was only the fifth time that has happened in any February in the ""Windy City."" (The fourth time also came this February.)

The warm weather in the Midwest was enabled by a marked lack of snow cover and lake ice across the Great Lakes, which allowed air temperatures to soar on mild southwesterly winds for days on end. As of Feb. 22, just 19.1 percent of the lower 48 states were snow-covered, far below average for this time of year.

While cold air is staging a comeback across the Midwest, where heavy snow is predicted to fall from Nebraska into Wisconsin, much of the South and East is likely to stay milder than average for at least a few more days.

The warm weather in the U.S. hasn't been a freak phenomenon only occurring for the past few weeks, either. The year-to-date is averaging a record daily highs to record daily lows ratio of more than 4-to-1, and studies have shown that over the past several decades, human-caused global warming has increased the odds of warm temperature records so that these ratios are becoming more and more skewed.

And the warmth isn't just limited to the U.S., either, with the planet recording its 3rd-warmest January on record, after its warmest year so far in 2016. This continues the long-term warming of about 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit since reliable surface temperatures began in 1880.

As the planet warms in response to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the ratio of high temperature records compared to low temperature records has become more skewed. If the climate weren't warming, that long-term ratio should average out to about 1-to-1. 

However, that isn't the world we're living in. A 2009 study found that the record highs to lows ratio was 2-to-1 for the lower 48 states during the 2000s, and this disparity has only grown since then, though not evenly across every part of the country. Projections show the imbalance increasing in coming decades as global warming continues, possibly to as high as 15-to-1 if emissions of planet-warming pollutants such as carbon dioxide continue apace.

""One thing I remind myself when comparing contemporary events to trends or patterns is that the contemporary events themselves make up the trends and patterns,"" said Deke Arndt, who leads the climate monitoring branch at NCEI. ""This is a real-time view into what we will call ""recent trends"" in a few years.""

""This week has been an up close look at the DNA of what we are seeing in the big picture: relative to historical norms, extreme heat continues to outpace extreme cold across almost every place, season and time of day in the USA.""

While individual months will still vary from this trend, it's clear that over the long-term, the ratio of record highs to record lows is now strongly favoring record highs as well as record warm overnight temperatures. This is consistent with computer model projections of a warming world. 

In other words, if you like 70-degree February days in Washington, D.C., you're in luck.

The odds are (increasingly) ever in your favor.",high,"Accurate, Insightful, Unbiased",80,"This article at Mashable discusses the number of high temperature records set in the United States during the month of February. While short-term weather events are not indicative of climate changes, the statistics of weather events across regions and over time do reflect climatic trends. As the climate warms due to human activities, daily high temperature records will be set more frequently than new low temperature records.

In the absence of a specific event attribution study we cannot quantify the role of climate change in this event. However, by pointing to the long-term trend in the ratio of record-setting, the article does a nice job of putting this event in the context of a warming world.

","This is a well-written piece that provides a nice summary of the current warm events in the bigger context of climate change. I caution against using a single month of data to support claims about climate change impacts on extremes, but the discussion about record highs outpacing record lows is a good one and provides strong evidence for influence of global warming on regional weather.

","This is a solid article that accurately describes recent record warm events in the US. A global perspective would have helped, as the US represents just 4% of the area of the Northern Hemisphere.

We expect in a stationary climate that we would have some periods with more record hot temperatures than record lows and vice versa. Over an extended period of time, in a stationary climate, this ratio would average to be one. It’s because this pattern of more record hot than record cold temperatures has persisted over recent decades that allows us to link this trend to climate change.",,,,"“As the planet warms in response to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the ratio of high temperature records compared to low temperature records has become more skewed.

",The shift towards more warm extremes suggests the underlying distributions (weather) are changing. The climatology is shifting towards higher temperatures.,,,,"“While transient weather variability is playing a key role here, the widespread record warmth across the U.S. so far this year is part of a long-term trend toward more warm temperature records versus cold ones.”

","The author correctly points out that it’s the superposition of persistent, extreme jet-stream fluctuations and the background of rising temperatures that is leading to more record warm extremes. Whether the extreme jet-stream fluctuations themselves are part of the changing winter climate is still unclear.

","I agree that the year-to-year natural variability can contribute significantly to extreme temperatures, especially at local or regional scales. The disproportionate number of record highs versus record lows over several years-to-decades suggests that the seasonal temperature distributions (or likelihoods of experiencing a given extreme during any given season) are shifting toward warmer temperatures consistent with long-term anthropogenic global warming. How continued warming affects the tails of the distributions (beyond just shifting the location) is an interesting and open question.",,"“So far this month, there have been nearly 5,000 daily record highs set or tied, compared to just 42 daily record lows.”","It is very appropriate to look at this ratio of record highs versus record lows, as the climate stations themselves have different periods of records and therefore different expected rates of records (all are “long term” and have at least 30 years of data but some have much longer periods of record). But, one would still expect a one-to-one ratio of record highs to record lows in a stationary climate regime.",,,,"“In Albany, New York, the high temperature of 74 degrees on Thursday was the warmest temperature on record for any day during the months of December, January and February.”

"Analysis of “Scientists have just detected a major change to the Earth’s oceans linked to a warming climate”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-just-detected-major-change-earths-oceans-linked-warming-climate-chris-mooney-the-washington-post/,Scientists have just detected a major change to the Earth’s oceans linked to a warming climate,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/15/its-official-the-oceans-are-losing-oxygen-posing-growing-threats-to-marine-life/,"A large research synthesis, published in one of the world’s most influential scientific journals, has detected a decline in the amount of dissolved oxygen in oceans around the world — a long-predicted result of climate change that could have severe consequences for marine organisms if it continues.

The paper, published Wednesday in the journal Nature by oceanographer Sunke Schmidtko and two colleagues from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany, found a decline of more than 2 percent in ocean oxygen content worldwide between 1960 and 2010. The loss, however, showed up in some ocean basins more than others. The largest overall volume of oxygen was lost in the largest ocean — the Pacific — but as a percentage, the decline was sharpest in the Arctic Ocean, a region facing Earth’s most stark climate change.

The loss of ocean oxygen “has been assumed from models, and there have been lots of regional analysis that have shown local decline, but it has never been shown on the global scale, and never for the deep ocean,” said Schmidtko, who conducted the research with Lothar Stramma and Martin Visbeck, also of GEOMAR.

AD
Ocean oxygen is vital to marine organisms, but also very delicate — unlike in the atmosphere, where gases mix together thoroughly, in the ocean that is far harder to accomplish, Schmidtko explained. Moreover, he added, just 1 percent of all the Earth’s available oxygen mixes into the ocean; the vast majority remains in the air.

Climate change models predict the oceans will lose oxygen because of several factors. Most obvious is simply that warmer water holds less dissolved gases, including oxygen. “It’s the same reason we keep our sparkling drinks pretty cold,” Schmidtko said.

But another factor is the growing stratification of ocean waters. Oxygen enters the ocean at its surface, from the atmosphere and from the photosynthetic activity of marine microorganisms. But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily.

AD
“When the upper ocean warms, less water gets down deep, and so therefore, the oxygen supply to the deep ocean is shut down or significantly reduced,” Schmidtko said.

The new study represents a synthesis of literally “millions” of separate ocean measurements over time, according to GEOMAR. The authors then used interpolation techniques for areas of the ocean where they lacked measurements.

The resulting study attributes less than 15 percent of the total oxygen loss to sheer warmer temperatures, which create less solubility. The rest was attributed to other factors, such as a lack of mixing.

Matthew Long, an oceanographer from the National Center for Atmospheric Research who has published on ocean oxygen loss, said he considers the new results “robust” and a “major advance in synthesizing observations to examine oxygen trends on a global scale.”

AD
Long was not involved in the current work, but his research had previously demonstrated that ocean oxygen loss was expected to occur and that it should soon be possible to demonstrate that in the real world through measurements, despite the complexities involved in studying the global ocean and deducing trends about it.

That’s just what the new study has done.

“Natural variations have obscured our ability to definitively detect this signal in observations,” Long said in an email. “In this study, however, Schmidtko et al. synthesize all available observations to show a global-scale decline in oxygen that conforms to the patterns we expect from human-driven climate warming. They do not make a definitive attribution statement, but the data are consistent with and strongly suggestive of human-driven warming as a root cause of the oxygen decline.

AD
“It is alarming to see this signal begin to emerge clearly in the observational data,” he added.

“Schmidtko and colleagues’ findings should ring yet more alarm bells about the consequences of global warming,” added Denis Gilbert, a researcher with the Maurice Lamontagne Institute at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Quebec, in an accompanying commentary on the study also published in Nature.

Because oxygen in the global ocean is not evenly distributed, the 2 percent overall decline means there is a much larger decline in some areas of the ocean than others.

Moreover, the ocean already contains so-called oxygen minimum zones, generally found in the middle depths. The great fear is that their expansion upward, into habitats where fish and other organism thrive, will reduce the available habitat for marine organisms.

AD
In shallower waters, meanwhile, the development of ocean “hypoxic” areas, or so-called “dead zones,” may also be influenced in part by declining oxygen content overall.

On top of all of that, declining ocean oxygen can also worsen global warming in a feedback loop. In or near low oxygen areas of the oceans, microorganisms tend to produce nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas, Gilbert writes. Thus the new study “implies that production rates and efflux to the atmosphere of nitrous oxide … will probably have increased.”

The new study underscores once again that some of the most profound consequences of climate change are occurring in the oceans, rather than on land. In recent years, incursions of warm ocean water have caused large die-offs of coral reefs, and in some cases, kelp forests as well. Meanwhile, warmer oceans have also begun to destabilize glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, and as they melt, these glaciers freshen the ocean waters and potentially change the nature of their circulation.

AD
When it comes to ocean deoxygenation, as climate change continues, this trend should also increase — studies suggest a loss of up to 7 percent of the ocean’s oxygen by 2100. At the end of the current paper, the researchers are blunt about the consequences of a continuing loss of oceanic oxygen.

“Far-reaching implications for marine ecosystems and fisheries can be expected,” they write.",very_high,"Accurate, Insightful",751,"This article in The Washington Post details a new study that compiled oxygen concentration measurements in the ocean from all over the world, showing a detectable global decrease of a little more than 2% since 1960. While the study does not definitively evaluate the cause of the observed decrease, this is an expected consequence of ocean warming.

According to the scientists who reviewed the article, it accurately represents research on the topic—including clear and measured descriptions of the negative impacts of oxygen trends on marine life.

",,,,,"Marina Levy, CNRS Senior scientist, Université Pierre et Marie Curie
","The content of the article is correct. It reports on a new study in Nature showing the first observational evidence of a diminution of oxygen levels in the oceans at a global scale. This is in agreement with projections from climate models. In some regions where oxygen concentrations are already low, this can be critical for ecosystems.
","Lauren Simkins, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia:","Changes in ocean chemistry, temperature, and circulation have significant consequences for marine life and can initiate positive feedbacks to accelerate ocean and atmosphere warming. This article is refreshing in that the author presents the results and significance of global ocean oxygen loss accurately and very clearly for non-expert audiences.

","This is a very good article which includes an interview with the first author as well as comments from two other researchers (Matthew Long and Denis Gilbert) who work on oxygen. The article is very accurate and the author does not exaggerate, but tries to explain several details.

","Jonathan Lauderdale, Postdoctoral Research Associate, MIT
","This article was well substantiated and measured in its reporting of the decline in global ocean oxygen concentrations, without being hysterical about the potential for mass fish suffocations, which I have seen in previous articles on this subject. Several quotes were from scientists not involved in the research paper, which lends credibility. Shame that the headline is not entirely transparent about the content of the article. The content does support the headline, but I would still consider this clickbait.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“A large research synthesis, published in one of the world’s most influential scientific journals, has detected a decline in the amount of dissolved oxygen in oceans around the world — a long-predicted result of climate change that could have severe consequences for marine organisms if it continues.”

","It has been clear for at least 10 years that oxygen has been declining in the world’s oceans, both in near-surface waters and at depth, particularly in those areas with strong, natural oxygen-minimum-zones. This new study greatly extends analyses of historical data to include a significantly longer time period, a much broader global area, and to the entire water column—from the surface to 6,000 meters [depth]. This volume represents most of the inhabitable volume of the planet, and what happens there impacts all organisms, including humans, that inhabit the thin skin of terra firma.",,,,"“But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily.”

","Enhanced stratification of the water column is indeed one mechanism that can explain the decrease in subsurface oxygen, notably in the tropics[1].

As the upper-layer of the ocean warms faster than the deeper layers, the temperature stratification increases, with the already-warm upper layer getting warmer. This enhanced thermal stratification acts as a barrier to vertical mixing, since warmer water is less dense (like when a low density fluid (e.g. oil) tops a high density fluid (e.g. water)). This stratification can prevent oxygen coming from the surface from reaching deeper layers where it gets depleted by biological activity (respiration).

As climate change proceeds, the upper-ocean layer is also expected to become fresher (less salty) in the tropics as rainfall increase, further increasing the upper-ocean stratification[2].

","It’s very good that the difficulties in detecting the signal of declining oxygen are mentioned by citing a researcher. Also the very cautious statement on the reasons are good. No unnecessary panic mongering.

","This is supported by the relatively rapid (sub-decadal to decadal) changes in global ocean oxygen loss that are consistent with rapid changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions and associated warming effects on the atmosphere and ocean, when compared to the longer-term context recorded in geological archives of past ocean variability.",,,"“Because oxygen in the global ocean is not evenly distributed, the 2 percent overall decline means there is a much larger decline in some areas of the ocean than others.”

","I think this is a subtle and important point to make—2% globally might not seem that much but there will be areas where the decline is more significant, such as the boundaries of Oxygen Minimum Zones, where waters could go from habitable to uninhabitable.

",,,,"“Moreover, the ocean already contains so-called oxygen minimum zones, generally found in the middle depths. The great fear is that their expansion upward, into habitats where fish and other organism thrive, will reduce the available habitat for marine organisms.”

","Expansion of naturally occurring oxygen-minimum-zones, particularly the world’s largest in the eastern Pacific Ocean, is becoming more and more firmly established over a vast region at depths of several hundred meters. What’s important—and counter-intuitive—about these oxygen-minimum-zone regions is that they tend to be dynamic features of some of the most productive upper-ocean areas on Earth. The Humboldt Current system off South America supports the world’s largest single-species fishery (Peruvian anchovetta) but has water with extremely low oxygen concentration in near-shore fishing zones at depths of less than 100 meters. Any vertical (upwards) expansion of this oxygen-minimum-zone will compress the surface layer where anchovetta as well as their predators (including human fishers) operate. Increasing the density of predator and prey in a shrinking volume seldom produces a pretty result. It’s not just a matter of reduced habitat for individual species—it’s more like putting an entire highly productive ecosystem into a trash compactor.",,,,"“At the end of the current paper, the researchers are blunt about the consequences of a continuing loss of oceanic oxygen. ‘Far-reaching implications for marine ecosystems and fisheries can be expected,’ they write.”

","Potential biological consequences of the trends in ocean deoxygenation documented are, if anything, understated. This is really serious business. We have done a fair job at increasing public awareness of ocean acidification, and we need to do that with deoxygenation as well. The scary thing is we know very little how these two phenomena (low pH and low oxygen) work together to impact animals that live in the ocean—from plankton to predators. When you add increasing temperature to this mix, it is clear that we have a lot to learn.

"Analysis of “What California’s Dam Crisis Says About the Changing Climate”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/california-dam-crisis-says-changing-climate-noah-diffenbaugh-new-york-times/,What California’s Dam Crisis Says About the Changing Climate,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/opinion/what-californias-dam-crisis-says-about-the-changing-climate.html,"STANFORD, Calif. — After five years of record-setting drought, much of California is being pummeled by an extremely wet winter. The disaster unfolding at Oroville, where precipitation is more than double the average, is the latest reminder that the United States needs a climate-smart upgrade of our water management systems.

In the West, much of our water infrastructure is old. Oroville Dam, north of Sacramento, was completed in 1968, nearly a half a century ago. Other major components of our water system are generations older, and maintenance has not been a priority. The damage to Oroville Dam, where the primary spillway developed a giant gash and the emergency spillway threatened to erode, illustrates the hazard of relying on aging infrastructure to protect us from extreme weather.

But age and upkeep are not the only problems. Our water system was designed and built in an old climate, one in which extremely warm years were less common and snowpack was more reliable. Here in the West, we use the same dams and reservoirs for both water storage and flood control, so during the wet season, reservoir managers continuously balance the dual pressures of storing as much water as possible for the dry summer and releasing sufficient water to create room for the next storm.

This system relies on the natural reservoir of mountain snowpack, which melts gradually over the spring and summer. While it is well known that much of the West relies on snowpack for water storage, the vital role of snowpack in flood control is considerably less appreciated. When precipitation falls as snow, it stays in the mountains rather than flowing into reservoirs. This leaves more room in reservoirs to prevent flooding downstream during heavy rainfall.

The recent drought has highlighted the pressure that a changing climate puts on a snowpack-dependent water system. With the shift toward more rain rather than snow, and the earlier melting of the snowpack, water managers need to release water more frequently for flood control. This dynamic is playing out in Oroville now, with the state’s water managers racing to empty water from the dam’s reservoir in advance of storms forecast to arrive Wednesday. Because these storms are relatively warm, they are likely to bring rain to the surrounding mountains, speeding the flow of water behind the dam.

The juxtaposition of five years of hot, dry conditions followed by more rain than reservoirs can store may seem incongruous. However, this is exactly what climate scientists have predicted for California since at least the 1980s: protracted periods of warm, dry conditions punctuated by intense wet spells, with more rain and less snow, causing both drought and floods. Recent work from my lab shows that in fact this pattern is already emerging, with the conditions that create extremely warm dry years and extremely wet years both becoming more frequent.

The other bitter reality is that this extremely wet winter will not wash away the drought. Depending where one looks, California lost out on one to three full years of precipitation from 2012 to 2016. That is a lot of water to make up in one year, and as of last week almost half of California was still in a state of drought. The moisture deficits that have accumulated during the drought have not been seen in our lifetimes. They have caused thousands of California residents to go without running water, resulted in groundwater contamination and permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity, and have severely stressed tens of millions of trees. As a result, even after this wet year, rural communities, groundwater aquifers and forest ecosystems will still feel the effects of the drought.

As the last five years illustrate, California’s water system is not equipped for climate change’s “new normal.” That water system must simultaneously provide for the country’s largest population and agricultural sector, and one of its most diverse natural environments. Although California has greatly improved water-use efficiency in the last half-century, climate change is pushing our water system to the limit. Investments in “climate smart” infrastructure can ensure the safety and security of Americans in the face of climate stresses now and in the future. These investments in infrastructure upgrades and expansion would create jobs, protect communities from disasters and help prepare us for changes in the climate. This effort would have several key elements:

First, given the new climate normal in which protracted hot, dry periods are far more common, we need to deploy technologies that can increase water supply. While expensive, energy-intensive desalination options have received considerable attention, wastewater recycling technologies have improved to the point that clean, safe water can now be delivered at reduced energy cost and can even be an energy source by using the organic matter in wastewater to produce energy. Investments in infrastructure to capture, store and clean urban storm water will also create new sources of water supply.

Second, we need to acknowledge that a water system that relies on snowpack for both water storage and flood control is increasingly risky. To make up for loss of snowpack, we need to build infrastructure that enables us to use excess runoff to recharge groundwater aquifers. This will have the dual benefit of replenishing groundwater that is drawn down during hot dry spells and capturing storm water that is lost when water is released for flood control.

Third, we need to prioritize infrastructure that helps us reliably supply safe water to both urban and rural communities while also ensuring that our vibrant agricultural sector and treasured ecosystems have the water that they need. Creating new supply and storage will help, but ensuring equity will require that infrastructure investments simultaneously provide for all of these constituencies.

Fourth, although California has made tremendous progress in improving efficiency, this drought shows that there is still more room to improve. New technologies such as “smart” sensors, coupled with expanded water markets, offer opportunities to further increase water efficiency.

Each of these infrastructure investments would increase the safety and security of Americans right now. That each would also help us to prepare for further climate change shouldn’t be a reason not to make those investments.",high,Accurate,45,"This op-ed in the New York Times written by Stanford researcher Noah Diffenbaugh discusses northern California’s Oroville Dam, where damage to a spillway recently led to a temporary evacuation. Scientists who reviewed the article found that its description of the stress that climate change exerts on water infrastructure in the American West—both flood protection and water supply management during drought—is mostly accurate.

However, the article’s title, “What California’s Dam Crisis Says About the Changing Climate”, can be read to imply that climate change, rather than a structural failure, is primarily responsible for the current situation at the Oroville Dam—which is not what the content of the article suggests.

",,,,,"Roger Bales, Professor of Engineering, University of California, Merced
","Factual & background statements do generally reflect common knowledge. Climate warming means that we do need to add resiliency to our infrastructure. The 4 recommendations of the article are on track, and consistent with the state’s Water Action Plan.

","Upmanu Lall, Professor of Engineering, Columbia University
","Misleading title—the dam crisis is primarily about the aging infrastructure and the neglect of investment in engineering and R&D as to how to plan, design, and build a new generation of water and energy infrastructure, while maintaining what we have. It tells us nothing about climate change.

The article itself is more nuanced and balanced, but ends up being an organ for the climate change story, which is important, while mentioning the need for urgent investment in and action on primary infrastructure only in passing.
","Ben Henley, Postdoctoral research fellow, University of Melbourne:","This is an eloquent and thoughtful article and is based on sound science in my opinion. The author’s down-to-earth descriptions of our understanding of the physical mechanisms are well communicated. He has linked his claims to peer-reviewed science in high-ranking journals.

","It doesn’t take much warming to change snowstorms into rainstorms. With a warmer climate, we get these winter storms, which dump rain rather than snow.
The “need to release water more frequently” is not necessarily true. The key needs are to upgrade the spillway, damage to which is limiting release capacity, and update the information system used to decide releases. The state is well aware of this, and public funds for investments remain limited in the current political climate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Analysis of “The big melt: Global sea ice at record low”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/big-melt-global-sea-ice-record-low-usa-today-doyle-rice/,The big melt: Global sea ice at record low,https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2017/02/08/sea-ice-record-low-arctic-antarctic/97646824/,"There is now less sea ice on Earth than at any time on record. Ice in the Arctic and Antarctic melted to record low levels in January, scientists reported this week.

Sea ice is frozen ocean water that melts during the summer and refreezes in winter. It floats on top of the ocean.

Arctic sea ice this January averaged 5.17 million square miles, the lowest for the month in the 38-year sea ice record, the National Snow and Ice Data Center said.

That is 100,000 square miles less than the previous January record low set just last year.

January air temperatures climbed above average over nearly all of the Arctic Ocean, NASA said, continuing a pattern that started in fall. In some parts of the Arctic, temperatures reached a whopping 9 degrees above average for the month.

At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said. The lack of ice in the Antarctic, where it is currently summer, is most pronounced in the Amundsen Sea, where only a few scattered patches of ice remain.

Sea ice in the Arctic affects wildlife such as polar bears, seals and walruses. It also helps regulate the planet’s temperature by influencing the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean. It can affect weather in the U.S.

The amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic has steadily declined over the past few decades because of man-made global warming, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

""Greenhouse gases emitted through human activities and the resulting increase in global mean temperatures are the most likely underlying cause of the sea ice decline,"" the snow and ice data center said.

Sea ice thickness also substantially declined in the latter half of the 20th century, the snow and ice data center said.

Antarctic ice fluctuates wildly year to year, and the link to man-made global warming there is not clear, NASA ice expert Walt Meier said.

Using paleoclimatic data, studies suggest sea ice is shrinking to levels not seen in thousands of years.",high,Accurate,93,"This USA Today article by Doyle Rice describes a US National Snow & Ice Data Center announcement that the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice set a record low for January extent.

The five scientists who reviewed the article concluded that it is accurate. It properly conveys the core facts about global sea ice extent and the attribution of continuing sea ice loss to human-induced warming of the climate—primarily in the Arctic, as the low sea ice extent around Antarctica this year has not yet been clearly connected to climate change.

",,,,,"Steffen Tietsche, Senior Scientist, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts:","The article does a good job in conveying the basic facts about sea ice and how it has been changing to a reader without prior knowledge of the subject. The strong statements it makes about the recently observed sea ice extremes are correct, and backed up by appropriate numbers, figures, and expert quotations and references","Michel Tsamados, Lecturer (Assistant Professor), University College London:","This is a factual article and gives an accurate representation of the state of the sea ice cover in 2016/2017. One small caveat is that the author states that “sea ice is shrinking to levels not seen in thousands of years” which is a bit vague and still a topic of active research. The IPCC report has a more timid statement (maybe too cautious?).
","François Massonnet, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Université catholique de Louvain","This article is based on facts, and does not attempt to over-interpret or extrapolate from these facts. References to the sources are provided. I consider the article trustworthy.

","Alek Petty, Postdoctoral associate, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center:","The article did a pretty good job in general of discussing recent sea ice decline, relying mainly on information from the NSIDC and NASA (reliable sources). The article was sometimes a bit loose in the language used, however (as highlighted by the annotations). This was somewhat unfortunate, as it would have been a good opportunity to provide the reader with more insight into the impact of sea ice decline, and the open questions that remain (e.g. regarding how it might impact US weather).

","Twila Moon, Research Scientist, University of Colorado, Boulder:","An excellent article that does a good job of summarizing current measurements of the loss of sea ice, especially in the Arctic. The article also hits on why this change is important and that the reduction in sea ice is directly connected to man-made climate change. These are important scientific points.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“There is now less sea ice on Earth than at any time on record. Ice in the Arctic and Antarctic melted to record low levels in January, scientists reported this week.”

","Focusing on sea ice extent can be dangerous as it is partly driven by short-term weather patterns, in contrast to the volume of sea ice that is now regularly monitored by European Space Agency satellite Cryosat and is more indicative of slower climatic changes.
Having said that, 2016/2017 has displayed such unusual patterns in total sea ice extent that it has triggered renewed interest in the scientific community.

","One has to bear in mind that the seasonal developments of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice are out of phase by ~6 months. Hence, the Earth’s “total” sea ice extent is a number with limited meaning, and is not directly obvious to interpret. In addition, this number smooths out regional variations, which can be particularly pronounced in the Antarctic.

Nevertheless, just like global-mean temperature or the GDP of a country, this number can be useful to have a 0th-order view on the health and state of our planet.

",,,"“Using paleoclimatic data, studies suggest sea ice is shrinking to levels not seen in thousands of years.”",The relevant assessment from the latest IPCC report (Chapter 5 Information from Paleoclimate Archives) is: “There is medium confidence from reconstructions that the current (1980–2012) summer sea ice retreat was unprecedented and sea surface temperatures in the Arctic were anomalously high in the perspective of at least the last 1450 years. Lower than late 20th century summer Arctic sea ice cover is reconstructed and simulated for the period between 8000 and 6500 years ago in response to orbital forcing.”,,,,"“‘Greenhouse gases emitted through human activities and the resulting increase in global mean temperatures are the most likely underlying cause of the sea ice decline,’ the snow and ice data center said.”

","Observed trends in Arctic sea ice result from the superposition of forced, man-made variations and internally generated variations. While it is clear from the literature (see IPCC WG1 AR5 Chapter 10 for a review) that observed trends cannot be explained by internal variability alone, it should be remembered that internal variability can also modulate the forced trends, in a way that is complex to properly describe.

In conclusion, greenhouse gases are well responsible for the observed decline, but their effect on sea ice trends may have even been amplified by internal variability.

",,,,"“The amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic has steadily declined over the past few decades because of man-made global warming, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.”

","A recent study* makes this link very tangible by attributing every loss of 3 ± 0.3 m2 of September sea-ice area to 1 metric ton of man-made CO2 emissions.

Notz and Stroeve (2016) Observed Arctic sea-ice loss directly follows anthropogenic CO2 emission, Science",,,,"“Sea ice thickness also substantially declined in the latter half of the 20th century, the snow and ice data center said.”

","This is an important change to emphasize because sea ice thickness is also an indicator of sea ice age. While thin sea ice can reform more quickly year to year, thick sea ice requires more time. The loss of thick sea ice is perhaps even more striking than the loss of ice area.

","It should be added here that this is talking about Arctic sea ice.

","Agree—and adding how we don’t know much about Antarctic sea ice thickness would have been helpful.

",,"“At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said. The lack of ice in the Antarctic, where it is currently summer, is most pronounced in the Amundsen Sea, where only a few scattered patches of ice remain.”

","Looking at recent time-evolution of Antarctic sea ice anomalies since November 2016 is insightful to appreciate the complexity of Antarctic sea ice dynamics. In early austral spring (below) the total Antarctic sea ice extent was already anomalously low because of strong ice retreat in the Indian Sector.

Three months later, the extent anomaly has persisted but is due to an unusual ice retreat in the Amundsen sector—i.e., at the exact opposite location—as the article correctly reports:

This short example reveals why sea ice extent is a useful, but not sufficient diagnostic to characterize the recent sea ice variability.

",,,,"“Antarctic ice fluctuates wildly year to year, and the link to man-made global warming there is not clear, NASA ice expert Walt Meier said.”

","This is true for the Antarctic, while the Arctic is expected to respond more significantly to climate change—the so-called polar amplification. This is described in detail in Box 5.1 | Polar Amplification of IPCC chapter 5 Information from Paleoclimate Archives.
On short time scales (~100 years) the Antarctic response differs from the Arctic and displays a delayed warming. There are several hypotheses proposed (see, for example, Ferreira et al, 2016*).

Ferreira et al (2016) Antarctic Ocean and Sea Ice Response to Ozone Depletion: A Two-Time-Scale Problem, Journal of Climate",,,,"“[Sea ice] also helps regulate the planet’s temperature by influencing the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean. It can affect weather in the U.S.”

","Sea ice acts as an insulating blanket over the Arctic Ocean and by removing it (via our impact on the climate) we are “performing the largest experiment in oceanography”, allowing the winds and atmosphere to directly interact with the Arctic Ocean and therefore potentially waking up the “sleeping Arctic Ocean” both mechanically and thermodynamically. (See the Lunch Hour Lecture at University College London below.)

","Sea ice cover is also better at reflecting energy from the sun than open ocean. This makes sea ice an important player in keeping the ocean surface from taking up additional heat.

","There is currently no consensus in the scientific community about the magnitude of Arctic-lower-latitudes teleconnections compared to other teleconnections (e.g. from the tropics). This statement has to be taken with caution.

"Analysis of “U.S. scientists officially declare 2016 the hottest year on record. That makes three in a row.”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/scientists-officially-declare-2016-hottest-year-record-chris-mooney-the-washington-post/,U.S. scientists officially declare 2016 the hottest year on record. That makes three in a row.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/18/u-s-scientists-officially-declare-2016-the-hottest-year-on-record-that-makes-three-in-a-row/,"In a powerful testament to the warming of the planet, two leading U.S. science agencies Wednesday jointly declared 2016 the hottest year on record, surpassing the previous record set just last year — which itself had topped a record set in 2014.

Average surface temperatures in 2016, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, were 0.07 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 2015 and featured eight successive months (January through August) that were individually the warmest since the agency’s records began in 1880.

The average temperature across the world’s land and ocean surfaces was 58.69 Fahrenheit, or 1.69 degrees above the 20th-century average of 57 degrees, NOAA declared. The agency also noted that the record for the global temperature has now successively been broken five times since the year 2000. The years 2005 and 2010 were also record warm years, according to the agency’s data set.

NASA concurred with NOAA, also declaring 2016 the warmest year on record in its own data set that tracks the temperatures at the surface of the planet’s land and oceans, and expressing “greater than 95 percent certainty” in that conclusion. (In contrast, NOAA gave a 62 percent confidence in the broken record.)

NASA found a bigger leap upward of temperatures in 2016, measuring the year as .22 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the prior record year of 2015. The agency also noted that since the year 2001, the planet has seen “16 of the 17 warmest years on record.”

Last year “is remarkably the third record year in a row in this series,” said Gavin Schmidt, who directs NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies, in a statement. “We don’t expect record years every year, but the ongoing long-term warming trend is clear.”

The record comes two days before Donald Trump, who has tweeted that global warming is a “hoax,” assumes the presidency and, with it, control over the two science agencies that announced these records. It is also the same day that Scott Pruitt, Trump’s controversial nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency, is appearing before the Senate in an often-tense confirmation hearing in which he has been questioned about climate change. Pruitt has previously written that the “debate” over climate change is “far from settled.”

Trump’s other nominees, such as State Department nominee Rex Tillerson and Interior Department nominee Ryan Zinke, have been less dismissive of climate change in their confirmation hearings, acknowledging at least some human contribution to the phenomenon but also raising questions either about the extent to which it is human-caused or about our capacity to predict the consequences. On Wednesday, Pruitt acknowledged that climate change is not a “hoax” and said that “the climate is changing, and human activity contributes to that in some manner.”

Scientists have been far less guarded. “2016 is a wake-up call in many ways,” Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Arizona, said of the year’s temperatures. “Climate change is real, it is caused by humans, and it is serious.”

NASA and NOAA produce slightly different records using somewhat different methodologies, but have now concurred on identifying 2014, 2015 and 2016 as, successively, the three warmest years in their records. There was a noticeable difference this year, however, in how much two agencies judged 2016 to have surpassed 2015. NASA was more bullish — a difference that Schmidt, in a press call Wednesday, attributed to different ways of measuring the Arctic.

“The warming in the Arctic has really been exceptional, and what you decide to do when you’re interpolating across the Arctic makes a difference,” Schmidt said.

But the differences between NOAA and NASA aren’t that significant, Schmidt further argued, in the context of the bigger picture. “Getting hung up on the exact nature of the records is interesting, and there’s lots of technical work that can be done there, but the main take-home response there is that the trends we’ve been seeing since the 1970s are continuing and have not paused in any way,” he said.

Here’s a NASA figure showing that long term trend, now updated through 2016:

Last year’s warmth was partly enhanced by a strong weather pattern known as El Niño, but the federal scientists underscore that this was not the only cause. For example, 1998 was also, at the time, the warmest year on record, thanks in part to a strong El Niño — but the 2016 planetary temperature now far surpasses the temperature of that year, as you can see above. The reason is that Earth has been warming since then, allowing another El Niño event, unlocking heat from the vast Pacific Ocean, to push overall temperatures to new heights.

“This El Niño might have contributed about a quarter or a third” of the record in 2016, said Deke Arndt, chief of the global monitoring branch at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, on a press call Wednesday.

Thus do natural wobbles of the planet’s temperature interact with an overall warming trend to produce records on a regular basis. At present, that means that while scientists would expect 2017 to be quite warm, relative to, say, a year in the 1990s, there has been little talk of a fourth record year in a row. And, indeed, El Niño has subsided.

Two other global agencies, the Japan Meteorological Agency and Britain’s Hadley Center, also track global temperatures. On Wednesday, the Hadley Center also announced that 2016 was the warmest year on record, albeit only “nominally” because it was very close to 2015 in the agency’s data set. The center reported that while 2016 was .77 degrees Celsius above the temperature average between 1961 and 1990, 2015 was very close at .76 degrees Celsius higher.

The difference between the Hadley Center and NASA once again comes down to the treatment of the Arctic, Schmidt explained.

“Our analysis demonstrates that the Arctic is warming around two to three times as fast as the global mean,” he said. “So that will be the cause of continuing divergences between the groups, and it ‘s something I think we all need to be thinking about.”

NASA further noted in its analysis that compared with the late 19th century, the planet has now warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s significant because the global community has been striving to limit overall warming to considerably below a 2 degree Celsius rise, and even, if possible, to hold it to a 1.5 degree Celsius increase. That is now about .4 degrees away, in Celsius, based on these figures.

“It is the second year in a row that the annual global temperature has been more than 1 Celsius degree higher than the pre-industrial level, and shows that the world is moving ever closer to the warming threshold of 1.5 Celsius degrees, beyond which many scientists have concluded the impacts of climate change will be unacceptably dangerous,” said Bob Ward, who is director of policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, part of the London School of Economics and Political Science.

Last year’s warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst coral bleaching event on record and large scale coral death, to the Arctic, where sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were also the warmest on record, at least from January through September 2016.

Among major 2016 events, the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef did not stand alone. In a catalogue of some of the extremes the planet witnessed during the year, NOAA also noted the megafire that engulfed Fort McMurray, in Alberta, Canada, at the beginning of May, relatively early in the year for wildfires. That event was certainly consistent with a warming climate, as well as with the role of El Niño, although scientists are reluctant to formally say that climate change has played a role in an individual event without conducting extensive analysis.

Extreme high temperatures were seen from India — where the city of Phalodi recorded temperatures of 51 degrees Celsius (123.8 Fahrenheit) in May, a new national record — to Iran, where a temperature of 53 degrees Celsius (127.4 F) was recorded in Delhoran on July 22.

For the contiguous United States, 2o16 was merely the second-warmest year on record, but for Alaska, it was the warmest yet recorded, underscoring once again the sharpness of Arctic warmth, in particular.

The particular signature of warming in 2016 was also revealing in another way, Overpeck said, noting that the stratosphere, the layer of the planet’s atmosphere stretching from about 8.5 to 13.5 miles above us, saw record cold temperatures last year.

“The pattern of record warmth in the lower atmosphere, coupled with record cold in the stratosphere, provides a clear fingerprint of the cause of the unprecedented warming — greenhouse gases trapping heat in the lower atmosphere instead of letting it escape to the stratosphere, and then to space. No doubt about it anymore — humans, mainly by burning fossil fuels, are cooking the planet,” Overpeck said.

All of that said, because of the extreme warmth that occurred early in 2016, the record just announced does not come as much of a surprise to weather and climate watchers. On April 15, NASA’s Schmidt tweeted: “Too soon? I estimate >99% chance of an annual record in 2016 in @NASAGISS temperature data, based on Jan-Mar alone.”",very_high,"Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",217,"On January 18th, NOAA and NASA released their annual assessment of the state of the global climate, including the fact that 2016 was the warmest year on record.

","The difference between NOAA and NASA-GISS is because of the way the Arctic—where much of the warming was in 2016, but where we do not have many measurements—is treated. NOAA excludes much of the Arctic, which gives it a cool bias in 2016, which is accounted for by a larger uncertainty.

NOAA. The gray areas are where NOAA’s methods do not have enough observations to compute the temperature. Not computing a temperature is similar to assuming these regions warm like the global average, but the Arctic warmed more.

Publications since have confirmed these findings.",,,,“[Jonathan Overpeck:] ‘it is caused by humans’”,"The usual method of prying apart the various factors responsible for temperature changes is by modelling; we know the input of the Sun, we know the composition of the atmosphere, etc. If you have a climate model that, with these parameters, can reproduce the climate of the past, you can be fairly sure that, even being by definition a simplification, it gets the physics right. You can then use the model to calculate what the influence of each individual parameter was*. You can even switch parameters on and off to see what happens. These models can then also be used for climate predictions under various assumptions on, say, greenhouse gas emissions.

",,,,"“‘This El Niño might have contributed about a quarter or a third’ of the record in 2016, said Deke Arndt, chief of the global monitoring branch at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, on a press call Wednesday.”

","I find this part confusing. The “percentage of the anomaly” caused by El Niño depends of course on the anomaly, which depends on the baseline. So it’s not really a useful number. El Niño caused a much larger fraction if you only look at a very recent baseline (e.g. just compare to 2014-15). A more straightforward number is the 2016 anomaly relative to what it would have been if ENSO were in a neutral phase. I calculated this to be ~0.13 C (0.23 F).

",I agree with Chris Colose. If you mention a fraction (a quarter or a third) you need to mention relative to what. The total warming since 1900 is about 1°C. The influence of El Nino on the 2016 temperature was small compared to that.,,,"“The particular signature of warming in 2016 was also revealing in another way, Overpeck said, noting that the stratosphere… saw record cold temperatures last year”

","The troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere) has also been rapidly warming. A newly updated record from Remote Sensing Systems using data from NASA satellites shows more warming in the troposphere than on the surface since 1979 (when satellite records began):

",,,,"“[Gavin Schmidt:] ‘We don’t expect record years every year, but the ongoing long-term warming trend is clear.’”","This is a really important point, especially as 2017 is likely to not break the 2016 record. We expect year-to-year variability, so we may not break the 2016 record for a few years, but the overall trend is upwards.

","Scientists like NASA’s Gavin Schmidt are also predicting slightly cooler 2017 temperatures as the El Niño fades, with 2017 projected to be somewhere between the 2nd and 5th warmest year on record. That said, we wouldn’t expect every single year to be a new record, and a slightly cooler 2017 is in no way inconsistent with the long term warming trend.

",,,"“Last year’s warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst coral bleaching event on record and large scale coral death, to the Arctic, where sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were also the warmest on record, at least from January through September 2016.”","This section accurately describes major 2016 events that occurred in the Earth system, and which most likely would not have occurred without global warming.

","The article overlooks the fact that not only was the bleaching on the northern Great Barrier Reef the worst on record, so was the bleaching in many areas around the world. In fact, the global coral bleaching event that is still underway is the longest, most widespread, and perhaps most damaging event on record.",,,"“Extreme high temperatures were seen from India — where the city of Phalodi recorded temperatures of 51 degrees Celsius (123.8 Fahrenheit) in May, a new national record — to Iran, where a temperature of 53 degrees Celsius (127.4 F) was recorded in Delhoran on July 22.”

","No direct link with climate change has been drawn by the article here and this is good. For these daily heat records, attribution to human-caused climate change is a lot harder than for extremes that occur on longer or larger scales. Indeed, in parts of India, the increase in aerosols due to pollution has counteracted the warming from greenhouse gas emissions so that there is virtually no trend in extreme high temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Analysis of “Ocean acidification: yet another wobbly pillar of climate alarmism”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/ocean-acidification-yet-another-wobbly-pillar-climate-alarmism-james-delingpole-the-spectator/,Ocean acidification: yet another wobbly pillar of climate alarmism,http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/ocean-acidification-yet-another-wobbly-pillar-of-climate-alarmism/,"There was a breathtakingly beautiful BBC series on the Great Barrier Reef recently which my son pronounced himself almost too depressed to watch. ‘What’s the point?’ said Boy. ‘By the time I get to Australia to see it the whole bloody lot will have dissolved.’

The menace Boy was describing is ‘ocean acidification’. It’s no wonder he should find it worrying, for it has been assiduously promoted by environmentalists for more than a decade now as ‘global warming’s evil twin’. Last year, no fewer than 600 academic papers were published on the subject, so it must be serious, right?

First referenced in a peer-reviewed study in Nature in 2003, it has since been endorsed by scientists from numerous learned institutions including the Royal Society, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the IPCC. Even the great David Attenborough — presenter of the Great Barrier Reef series — has vouched for its authenticity: ‘If the temperature rises up by two degrees and the acidity by a measurable amount, lots of species of coral will die out. Quite what happens then is anybody’s guess. But it won’t be good.’

No indeed. Ocean acidification is the terrifying threat whereby all that man-made CO2 we’ve been pumping into the atmosphere may react with the sea to form a sort of giant acid bath. First it will kill off all the calcified marine life, such as shellfish, corals and plankton. Then it will destroy all the species that depend on it — causing an almighty mass extinction which will wipe out the fishing industry and turn our oceans into a barren zone of death.

Or so runs the scaremongering theory. The reality may be rather more prosaic. Ocean acidification — the evidence increasingly suggests — is a trivial, misleadingly named, and not remotely worrying phenomenon which has been hyped up beyond all measure for political, ideological and financial reasons.

Some of us have suspected this for some time. According to Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace, long one of ocean acidification theory’s fiercest critics, the term is ‘just short of propaganda’. The pH of the world’s oceans ranges between 7.5 and 8.3 — well above the acid zone (which starts below ‘neutral’ pH7) — so more correctly it should be stated that the seas are becoming slightly less alkaline. ‘Acid’ was chosen, Moore believes, because it has ‘strong negative connotations for most people’.

Matt Ridley, too, has been scathing on the topic. In The Rational Optimist he wrote, ‘Ocean acidification looks suspiciously like a back-up plan by the environmental pressure groups in case the climate fails to warm.’ I agree. That’s why I like to call it the alarmists’ Siegfried Line — their last redoubt should it prove, as looks increasingly to be the case, that the man-made global warming theory is a busted flush.

To the alarmist camp, of course, this is yet further evidence that ‘deniers’ are heartless, anti-scientific conspiracy theorists who don’t read peer-reviewed papers and couldn’t give a toss if the world’s marine life is dissolved in a pool of acid due to man’s selfishness and greed. Unfortunately for the doom-mongers, we sceptics have just received some heavy fire-support from a neutral authority.

Howard Browman, a marine scientist for 35 years, has published a review in the ICES Journal of Marine Science of all the papers published on the subject. His verdict could hardly be more damning. The methodology used by the studies was often flawed; contrary studies suggesting that ocean acidification wasn’t a threat had sometimes had difficulty finding a publisher. There was, he said, an ‘inherent bias’ in scientific journals which predisposed them to publish ‘doom and gloom stories’.

Ocean acidification theory appears to have been fatally flawed almost from the start. In 2004, two NOAA scientists, Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine, produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels. But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information. Their chart only started in 1988 but, as Wallace knew, there were records dating back to at least 100 years before. So why had they ignored the real-world evidence in favour of computer-modelled projections?

When Wallace plotted a chart of his own, incorporating all the available data, covering the period from 1910 to the present, his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last -century.

Even if the oceans were ‘acidifying’, though, it wouldn’t be a disaster for a number of reasons — as recently outlined in a paper by Patrick Moore for the Frontier Centre for Public Policy. First, marine species that calcify have survived through millions of years when CO2 was at much higher levels; second, they are more than capable of adapting — even in the short term — to environmental change; third, seawater has a large buffering capacity which prevents dramatic shifts in pH; fourth, if oceans do become warmer due to ‘climate change’, the effect will be for them to ‘outgas’ CO2, not absorb more of it.

Finally, and perhaps most damningly, Moore quotes a killer analysis conducted by Craig Idso of all the studies which have been done on the effects of reduced pH levels on marine life. The impact on calcification, metabolism, growth, fertility and survival of calcifying marine species when pH is lowered up to 0.3 units (beyond what is considered a plausible reduction this century) is beneficial, not damaging. Marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification.

Given all this, you might well ask why our learned institutions, government departments and media outlets have put so much effort into pretending otherwise. Why, between 2009 and 2014, did Defra spend a whopping £12.5 million on an ocean acidification research programme when the issue could have been resolved, for next to nothing, after a few hours’ basic research?

To those of us who have been studying the global warming scare in some detail, the answer is depressingly obvious. It’s because in the last decade or so, the climate change industry has become so vast and all encompassing, employing so many people, it simply cannot be allowed to fail.

According to a report last year by Climate Change Business Journal, it’s now worth an astonishing $1.5 trillion — about the same as the online shopping industry. If the scare goes away, then all bets are off, because the entire global decarbonisation business relies on it. The wind parks, the carbon sequestration projects, the solar farms, the biomass plantations — none of these green schemes make any kind of commercial sense unless you buy into the theory that anthropogenic CO2 is catastrophically warming the planet and that radical green measures, enforced by governmental regulation, must be adopted to avert it.

It’s no coincidence that the ocean acidification narrative began in the early 2000s — just as it was beginning to dawn on the climate alarmists that global temperatures weren’t going to plan. While CO2 levels were continuing to rise, temperatures weren’t. Hence the need for a fallback position — an environmental theory which would justify the massively expensive and disruptive ongoing decarbonisation programme so assiduously championed by politicians, scientists, green campaigners and anyone making money out of the renewables business. Ocean acidification fitted the bill perfectly.

Does this prove that global warming is not a problem? No it doesn’t. What it does do is lend credence to something we much-maligned sceptics have long been saying: that in many environmental fields, the science is being abused and distorted to promote a political and financial agenda. Perhaps it’s about time our supposed ‘conspiracy theories’ were taken more seriously.",very_low,"Biased, Cherry-picking, Inaccurate, Misleading",378,"Research shows that the pH of the ocean is currently decreasing due to human emissions of CO2 and that this already has negative consequences for marine ecosystems—and continued emissions is expected to have further negative consequences.

This showed that the increase in acidity caused by our CO2 emissions is already slowing reef growth, harming the reef.

But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information[…] his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last -century.”
","This is plain wrong. Oceanic pH levels decreased by 0.1 units compared to pre-industrial levels. This corresponds to a 30% increase in acidity. For a primer on pH, see this NOAA explainer.

","This statement just flies in both the face of observational facts and a basic understanding of chemistry. I would love to hear a cogent explanation of how atmospheric CO2 levels could rise over the course of a century without producing a decrease in ocean pH.
Observations near Hawaii and several other open ocean environments show clear decreasing trends in ocean pH. See, for example this report from the European Environment Agency.
It is one thing to challenge future projections, but rejecting well-established scientific facts is another thing entirely.

","Michael Wallace contacted Chris Sabine and myself several years ago and asked how to get access to historical pH measurements in the oceans so he could determine long-term trends of global ocean pH for himself. We directed him to both modern (as published in Feely et al., 2008) and historical pH measurements archived at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. We cautioned him that the earlier data sets prior to 1989 had significant issues with data quality as described in the document that went along with the data set obtained from NCEI. Mr. Wallace went on to perform his analysis of the historical data without regard for the oceanographic community’s concerns about the data quality or for the proper methodology to perform this kind of analysis. He chose to publish his results within the context of an interview written by Marita Noon in the Farmington Daily Times. We responded by correcting the record by formally restating our concerns about Mr. Wallace’s incorrect use of the historical data on our website. In short, Wallace’s chart does not show any kind of useful trend in global ocean pH because the data he used, and the way he used them, were not appropriate for this kind of analysis. In the first place, the pH measurements prior to 1989 were not reliable enough to detect small pH changes over that period. In addition, companion meta data on sensor calibration, pH scales, and temperature corrections were not available. Finally, the data were so limited that no meaningful global averages could be determined. The article by Mr. Delingpole in The Spectator failed to address these important issues, as Philip Williamson correctly points out in his response to the article.

",,“Ocean acidification is the terrifying threat whereby all that man-made CO2 we’ve been pumping into the atmosphere may react with the sea to form a sort of giant acid bath.”,That is incorrect. No peer-reviewed article claim that the ocean will become acid (pH < 7).,,,,"“‘Acid’ was chosen, Moore believes, because it has ‘strong negative connotations for most people’.”

","The terms acidification was not chosen for its negative connotation but rather because it defines the direction of change. Here is a simple example: when you describe the cooling of your coffee what term do you use? Cooling or un-warming? If the temperature is going down we say it is cooling. If the temperature is going up we say it is warming. The same applies to acidity. When the pH of something goes down we say that it is acidifying. That simple.

",,,,“so more correctly it should be stated that the seas are becoming slightly less alkaline.”,"This is actually not correct. Invasion of CO2 into the ocean does not change its alkalinity at all. By adding carbonic acid, and keeping alkalinity constant (defined as either the difference between dissolved cations and anions, or the excess of acid-base species at the CO2 equivalence point), the pH decreases.

",,,,“seawater has a large buffering capacity which prevents dramatic shifts in pH;”,"This is true; however, the amount of CO2 emitted by humans is also massive, a large portion of which has already been absorbed by the oceans. Since pH is relatively insensitive to changes in CO2, it is often not the right parameter to look at in the whole system. For example, over the range of pH values which the author states are found in natural seawater, the surface pCO2 changes from 180 ppm (pH 8.3) to 1500 ppm (pH 7.5). Thus, a mean change in ocean pH of 0.3 pH units represents almost a tripling of seawater pCO2.

",,,,"“[…]The impact on calcification, metabolism, growth, fertility and survival of calcifying marine species when pH is lowered up to 0.3 units […] is beneficial, not damaging. Marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification.”

","There is much evidence available to falsify this statement. Many experiments have shown substantial negative biological responses at these levels of pH change. Of course, some organisms are relatively unaffected by these levels.

An older review that is available here without a paywall:

Langdon (2002) Review of experimental evidence for effects of CO2 on calcification of reef builders. In Proc. 9th Int. Coral Reef Sym.",,,,"“Then it will destroy all the species that depend on it — causing an almighty mass extinction which will wipe out the fishing industry and turn our oceans into a barren zone of death.”

","That is not a truthful summary of the scientific literature. Check, for example, the meta-analysis of Kroeker et al. (2013) who describe processes and organisms that do not seem to be affected by ocean acidification.

Kroeker et al. (2013) Impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms: quantifying sensitivities and interaction with warming. Global Change Biology.",,,,"“a killer analysis conducted by Craig Idso of all the studies which have been done on the effects of reduced pH levels on marine life.”

","This publication is not peer-reviewed, cherry-picks articles and does not involve proper statistical testing. It does not, therefore, qualify as a “killer analysis”! The comprehensive metanalysis that was performed by Kroeker et al. (2013) revealed decreased survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among taxonomic groups.

Kroeker et al (2013) Impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms: quantifying sensitivities and interaction with warming. Global Change Biology.
","The Idso meta-analysis described by Delingpole was never published. It does not take into account the proper method of proportional scaling analysis. It does not demonstrate how negative effects will impact ecosystem services and food-web processes that can have an effect on economically important fish and shellfish. It does not address the impacts we are already seeing on important fish food, such as pteropods (see Bednarsek et al., 2012, 2014; Feely et al., 2016). There are several highly credible published meta-analysis studies (Kroeker et al. ,2013; Wittman & Pörtner, 2013; and Busch and McElhany, 2016) that have told a much different story than Idso’s unpublished work. Delingpole failed to even mention these other studies, which show very significant impacts on several marine taxa. In summary, Delingpole’s article demonstrates a complete lack of appreciation of scientific literature on this topic and the proper choice of scientific methods for data analysis and synthesis that leads to a more accurate understanding of the present-day and future impacts of ocean acidification.

","Many marine organisms respond to changes in calcium carbonate mineral saturation states. These depend not only on pH, but also on factors including amounts of carbon and calcium in the ocean. One of the most important factors is ocean alkalinity, which varies on time scale of many thousands of years. In the geologic past, when atmospheric CO2 was high, ocean alkalinity was also high, and so carbonate mineral saturation states could remain high.

Unfortunately, on the timescale of centuries or decades, changes come too fast for the ocean’s natural processes to buffer ocean carbonate mineral saturation states.

Directly comparing effects of high CO2 levels that developed in the geologic past over many millions of years with high CO2 levels developing today over decades and centuries shows a fundamental lack of understanding of well-established global geochemical cycles. This open access article explains some of the relevant chemistry:

Cao et al (2016) Simulated effect of deep-sea sedimentation and terrestrial weathering on projections of ocean acidification, Journal of Geophysical Research Oceans
","Some calcifying species were indeed abundant in the Cretaceous, a time at which the atmospheric CO2 concentration was high. However, seawater alkalinity was also high due to intense weathering on land. Hence, the concentration of carbonate ions (CO3, which controls calcification) was elevated. That compensation does not happen today and will not happen in the near future because total alkalinity does not change significantly on time scales of centuries. There is ample evidence in the literature for that.

Some fast-growing species are indeed able to develop some level of adaptation after several hundreds of generation. Overall, there is evidence that all past episodes of ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation have led to mass extinctions. Furthermore, there is no calcifier close to CO2 vents, suggesting that adaptation has limited capabilities.",,,"“if oceans do become warmer due to ‘climate change’, the effect will be for them to ‘outgas’ CO2, not absorb more of it”","Incorrect: The effect of warming is completely overwhelmed by the effect of increased atmospheric CO2.

Severe “snowmageddon” winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked. The scientists now fear the Arctic meltdown has kickstarted abrupt changes in the planet’s swirling atmosphere, bringing extreme weather in heavily populated areas to the boil.

The northern ice cap has been shrinking since the 1970s, with global warming driving the loss of about three-quarters of its volume so far. But the recent heat in the Arctic has shocked scientists, with temperatures 33C above average in parts of the Russian Arctic and 20C higher in some other places.

In November, ice levels hit a record low, and we are now in “uncharted territory”, said Prof Jennifer Francis, an Arctic climate expert at Rutgers University in the US, who first became interested in the region when she sailed through it on a round-the-world trip in the 1980s.

“These rapid changes in the Arctic are affecting weather patterns where you live right now,” she said. “In the past you have had natural variations like El Niño, but they have never happened before in combination with this very warm Arctic, so it is a whole new ball game.

“It is inconceivable that this ridiculously warm Arctic would not have an impact on weather patterns in the middle latitudes further south, where so many people live.

“It’s safe to say [the hot Arctic] is going to have a big impact, but it’s hard to say exactly how big right now. But we are going to have a lot of very interesting weather – we’re not going to get around that one.”

The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt. Unlike on the Antarctic continent, melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath, which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further. This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet.

This in turn narrows the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes, which is crucial because it is the temperature gradient between them that drives the jet stream wind, which streaks around the pole at up to 250mph and about 8km above the surface.

The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker. This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes.

Furthermore, researchers say, the changes mean the loops can remain stuck over regions for weeks, rather than being blown westwards as in the past. This “blocking” effect means extreme events can unfold.

“There have been recent studies showing very plausible physical mechanisms of how rapid warming in the Arctic can influence weather in the mid latitudes, both in summer and winter,” said Dim Coumou at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Coumou is a former offshore industry geophysicist who has studied the link between extreme weather events and global warming since 2010.

“A couple of years ago this was the main criticism on any such links, that the physics was not well understood,” he said. “But the big question [now] is, how important are these mechanisms?”

The other main influence on the jet stream is sea surface temperature in the tropics, which waxes and wanes with El Niño, while solar cycles and even volcanic eruptions have smaller effects.

The clearest connection so far between the melting Arctic and weather is for extreme winter conditions, such as the intense winters that hit parts of North America and northern Europe in 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2013-14, causing record snowfalls and billions of dollars of damage.

In those years, the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions, pulling down savagely cold air. Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: “The consensus points towards that being a real effect.”

While downswings of the jet stream can bring freezing winters, the accompanying upswings have been linked to worsening the drought in California. “These northward jet stream swings are of course the reason California is having such a terrible drought,” said Francis. This effect was in fact predicted back in 2004, with those researchers now saying: “Reality is moving faster than we thought or hoped it would.”

But the winter extremes can also swing the other way and bring mild but torrential weather, as seen in the past two winters in the UK, leading to severe flooding, said Prof Edward Hanna, at the University of Sheffield in the UK.

He pointed to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a cyclic variation in air pressure that may be affected by the fast melting of Arctic ice. The variability of the NOA has doubled in the last century, he said: “Within the last decade, there have been wild swings in the NAO values in December.”

The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link.

Blocking patterns caused by slow-moving meanders of the jet stream have been firmly linked to some devastating events, including the 2010 summer floods in Pakistan, which killed 2,000 people and affected 20 million, and also the searing heatwave in Russia in the same year, which killed 50,000 people and wiped out $15bn (£12bn) of crops.

“We also see such summer events more often in recent years,” said Coumou.

Blocking events have also been linked to summer deluges in the UK, leading to disastrous flooding in 2007 and 2012 which caused billions of pounds in damage.

The year 2012 was also an extreme year for Greenland, with record melting across its entire surface flushing water into the ocean and accelerating sea level rise. The hot loop of air that sat on Greenland that year may also be linked to one of the biggest weather disasters of recent years: Hurricane Sandy, which killed 233 people and cost $75bn in damages.

Scientists suspect that the blocking event over Greenland, potentially linked to the record low Arctic ice that summer, prevented the hurricane veering north-east out into the Atlantic like most storms. Instead, blocked by the high pressure, Sandy swung left over the most populated area of the east coast of the US.

Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.

The melting of Greenland ice is pouring about 250bn tonnes a year of fresh water, which is less dense than salty sea water, into the ocean. As a result, the water mass sinks less and the current that drags warm water up the Atlantic is weakened – scientists have already found that the current is at its weakest for a millennium.

This means a region of the north Atlantic is becoming relatively cool and this exaggerates the contrast with tropical waters to the south, which is the driver for storms. In the worst case scenario, said the renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, this “will drive superstorms, stronger than any in modern times – all hell will break loose in the north Atlantic and neighbouring lands”.

Hansen– who was one of the first scientists to alert the world to the dangers of climate change in 1988 and has been arrested more than once outside the White House while protesting against fossil fuel developments – pointed to the historical record as a precedent: 118,000 years ago a superstorm tossed 1,000-tonne mega boulders on to the shores of the Bahamas.

“I would certainly not call such [superstorm] scenarios ridiculous,” said Coumou. “But it is speculative – we don’t have the hard evidence.”

But even with what is known so far, there is cause for concern that the complex interactions are turning the slow burn of global temperature rise into sudden weather disasters.

“The worrying aspect is that such dynamical changes can occur more abruptly than simple background warming of the climate,” said Coumou. “Dynamical changes can change more rapidly and can therefore lead to surprises and I think there are many such possibilities in the system.”

Amid the gloomy prospects, there is some cause for hope however. “A large fraction of the US public still doesn’t believe that it is humans that are affecting the climate system,” said Francis. “But one of the silver linings of this pretty dark cloud is that the Arctic is such an obvious and conspicuous change, that anybody can see them happening. There is no ambiguity whatsoever.”

But this changing of minds needs to happen quickly, said Hansen: “If we wait for the natural world to reveal itself clearly, it may be too late.”","neutral, high",Insightful,118,"This article in The Guardian discusses the influence of Arctic warming on mid-latitude weather patterns. The Arctic is warming faster than the global average, and the possibility that this warming is driving a change in the behavior of the jet stream—and the mid-latitude weather that results—has seen lots of coverage in the past few years.

While the article includes interviews with a number of scientists doing research on these patterns, the scientists who reviewed it explained that the conclusions expressed aren’t completely representative of current scientific knowledge: There remains real uncertainty about the link between Arctic warming and certain mid-latitude weather patterns, which the article does not make entirely clear to the reader.

","The article nicely introduces some of the emerging science linking Arctic climate change to extreme weather at lower latitudes. There are no major inaccuracies and the author has sought expert comment from several prominent scientists. However, the article fails to fully capture the large uncertainty about how Arctic warming may influence weather in places further south and how big this effect might be. For example, the article draws heavily on a scientific hypothesis that Arctic warming causes a more meandering jet stream and slower moving weather systems (e.g. blocking). This is a credible hypothesis supported by a few peer-reviewed publications (most prominently by one of the scientists interviewed), but there are other papers that have failed to identify such a link, or argued against one.

In short, there is no scientific consensus on whether or not Arctic warming causes larger jet stream wiggles or more persistent weather. The jury is still out. Whilst some of the scientist’s quotes do hint at unknowns and ongoing scientific debate, the overall tone of the article gives the impression the science on this topic is more settled than it actually is.

","I think the writer basically captured the essence of the scientific information provided to him, although some simplifications make the state of the knowledge sound more sweeping than the consensus view in the community. There are skeptical voices in the community whose views differ from those presented in this article. A more complete story could have included them to provide an alternative perspective on the role of a changing Arctic.

",,,"Daniel Swain, Climate Scientist, University of California, Los Angeles:","The author has sought out and quoted relevant experts in the field, and presents specific factual information that is largely accurate regarding a topic that is of considerable interest to both researchers and the public at large. My primary concern with this piece is that it overstates scientific confidence in the linkages between Arctic sea ice loss and mid-latitude weather (especially regarding connections to specific events, like Hurricane Sandy) and fails to make clear that this area remains a topic of very active research. It also uses some language that trends toward hyperbolic, especially in discussing “superstorms”.

","The article spans a wide range of related, but complex topics. Had it focused on just one, such as the potential link between Arctic sea ice melt and midlatitude atmospheric blocking patterns, the writer could have perhaps provided a more thorough summary of what researchers know and, just as importantly, how confident they are in their results.
While this article provides insight on how Arctic warming and melting sea ice may affect midlatitude weather, it misleadingly presents the sea ice-albedo feedback as the only contributor to Arctic temperature amplification.","Tim Woollings, Lecturer, University of Oxford:","The article seems to faithfully summarise the views of these scientists. However, this is a relatively small group of researchers, and many in the field would give a more cautious story given current uncertainties.

While some studies have concluded that the sea ice-albedo feedback is the primary driver of Arctic amplification [1-2]​​, other feedbacks [3-4]​​, internal atmospheric variability, and decadal variations in sea surface temperature and ocean circulation [​5]​​, may have contributed as much, if not more, to the Arctic tropospheric temperature increase.

","The statement regarding what the jet stream is (a “boundary between cold north and warmer south”) is essentially correct, and there is indeed evidence that the north-south temperature difference has decreased in some regions.[1] But there remains considerable scientific uncertainty regarding whether the jet stream is actually “meandering more” in a general sense, and whether these large jet stream meanders are actually caused by sea ice loss.[2-3]

","The first sentence is grounded in solid meteorology, since the strength of westerly winds aloft is basically proportional to the north-south temperature difference. The second sentence is also supported by evidence, although not quite as solidly. The sinuosity of the upper-level westerlies generally does vary inversely with the wind speed, but there are exceptions. When the jet stream meanders a lot, then warm air is brought northward and cold air spills southward.",,,"“Furthermore, researchers say, the changes mean the loops can remain stuck over regions for weeks, rather than being blown westwards as in the past. This “blocking” effect means extreme events can unfold.”","First, I think the word should be “eastwards”, not “westwards”. Second, although the loops do sometimes remain stuck for weeks, the sentence makes it seem as if this is the new normal. Instead, a weaker jet stream ought to increase the persistence on various time scales, but more often being days instead of weeks. The second sentence is partly true, in that atmospheric blocking patterns often do cause extreme weather events, but extreme events can also occur under other conditions, including very strong jet stream winds (e.g. atmospheric rivers).",,,,"“Severe ‘snowmageddon’ winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked.”

","Arctic temperatures have certainly been much higher than the long-term average in recent years, and the extreme warm anomalies this autumn and early winter have been particularly noteworthy. Further, there is a growing body of evidence linking Arctic sea ice loss and/or polar-amplified atmospheric warming to changes in mid-latitude atmospheric circulation*. However, this subject represents a very active area of research and there remains genuine scientific uncertainty regarding specific linkages between ongoing Arctic sea ice loss and specific kinds of extreme weather (like the heatwaves, floods, and snowstorms mentioned here). Moreover, the effects under consideration would likely have different regional manifestations. Therefore, the above statement overstates scientific confidence in such linkages and is overly broad in a geographic sense.

","“Strongly linked” is an overstatement here. There is some evidence, but I don’t think a majority of climate scientists would make claims as strong as these.",,,"“It’s safe to say [the hot Arctic] is going to have a big impact, but it’s hard to say exactly how big right now.”

","This statement is unclear. Arctic warming will clearly have a strong impact on the midlatitudes in the future (certainly by the end of the century). Whether it has had a noticeable effect so far is a lot less clear.

",,,,"“In those years, the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions, pulling down savagely cold air. Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: ‘The consensus points towards that being a real effect.’”

","The first sentence is correctly describing how the jet stream tends to move equatorward during the negative phase of the North Atlantic (or Arctic) Oscillation [NAO and AO, respectively], which was very prevalent in those years. Negative phases of the NAO or AO strongly promote more extreme cold in middle latitudes during winter. As for a “consensus”, that depends a lot on who you ask. This topic of potential Arctic-middle latitude connections is a controversial one, so there isn’t a lot of consensus on the overall role of the Arctic at this point. I think the closest we have to a consensus is the persuasive evidence that sea ice loss in the Barents-Kara Seas during autumn-winter promotes extreme cold downstream over eastern Asia via a stronger Siberian High Pressure Cell.

","This refers to a southward shifted jet in response to sea ice loss (a negative North Atlantic Oscillation pattern). It’s not clear at all that this is the same kind of behaviour as suggested by the quoted scientists.

",,,"“The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link.”

","The winter link is not certain either. As above, there is some evidence for a North Atlantic Oscillation response but still several conflicting studies.

","Again, it depends who one talks to about whether “probable” is the correct term. There have been numerous articles making this claim and providing plausible evidence for it, but a well-accepted physical explanation has yet to be established, in my opinion. The dynamical mechanisms linking sea ice anomalies to mid-latitude weather during winter are easier to understand than those during summer. Different but more complex linkages might well exist during summer to explain some of the observational evidence correlating sea ice anomalies with extreme summer weather.",,,"“Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.”

","This statement does not accurately describe an outcome that is widely supported in the scientific literature. It is certainly true that Arctic sea ice is decreasing at a rapid rate, and that further sea ice loss is highly likely in the future. It is also plausible, and supported by existing research, that present and future sea ice loss may alter the atmospheric circulation in ways that affect the likelihood of certain kinds of weather events*. But the claim regarding “Atlantic superstorms” and “hurricanes barreling across Europe” seems fairly hyperbolic.

In the worst case scenario, said the renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, this ‘will drive superstorms, stronger than any in modern times – all hell will break loose in the north Atlantic and neighbouring lands’.”","I agree that the superstorm suggestion is very speculative. In one paper we looked at a similar scenario and saw a clear increase in the number of storms, but not their intensity, though that was just in one climate model.

"Analysis of “Stunning new data indicates El Nino drove record highs in global temperatures…”

The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end.

The fall, revealed by Nasa satellite measurements of the lower atmosphere, has been caused by the end of El Nino – the warming of surface waters in a vast area of the Pacific west of Central America.

Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record.

The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end.

The fall, revealed by Nasa satellite measurements of the lower atmosphere, has been caused by the end of El Nino – the warming of surface waters in a vast area of the Pacific west of Central America.

Others have argued that the records were caused by El Nino, a complex natural phenomenon that takes place every few years, and has nothing to do with greenhouse gas emissions by humans.

The new fall in temperatures suggests they were right.

Big El Ninos always have an immense impact on world weather, triggering higher than normal temperatures over huge swathes of the world. The 2015-16 El Nino was probably the strongest since accurate measurements began, with the water up to 3C warmer than usual.

It has now been replaced by a La Nina event – when the water in the same Pacific region turns colder than normal. 

This also has worldwide impacts, driving temperatures down rather than up.

The satellite measurements over land respond quickly to El Nino and La Nina. Temperatures over the sea are also falling, but not as fast, because the sea retains heat for longer. 

This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter – because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year.

But it is almost certain that next year, large falls will also be measured over the oceans, and by weather station thermometers on the surface of the planet – exactly as happened after the end of the last very strong El Nino in 1998. If so, some experts will be forced to eat their words.

Last year, Dr Schmidt said 2015 would have been a record hot year even without El Nino. 

‘The reason why this is such a warm record year is because of the long-term underlying trend, the cumulative effect of the long-term warming trend of our Earth,’ he said. This was ‘mainly caused’ by the emission of greenhouse gases by humans.

Dr Schmidt also denied that there was any ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’ in global warming between the 1998 and 2015 El Ninos.

But on its website home page yesterday, Nasa featured a new study which said there was a hiatus in global warming before the recent El Nino, and discussed why this was so. Last night Dr Schmidt had not returned a request for comment.

However, both his own position, and his Nasa division, may be in jeopardy. US President-elect Donald Trump is an avowed climate change sceptic, who once claimed it was a hoax invented by China.

Last week, Mr Trump’s science adviser Bob Walker said he was likely to axe Nasa’s $1.9 billion (about £1.4 billion) climate research budget.

Other experts have also disputed Dr Schmidt’s claims. Professor Judith Curry, of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, said yesterday: ‘I disagree with Gavin. The record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were primarily caused by the super El Nino.’

The slowdown in warming was, she added, real, and all the evidence suggested that since 1998, the rate of global warming has been much slower than predicted by computer models – about 1C per century.

David Whitehouse, a scientist who works with Lord Lawson’s sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation, said the massive fall in temperatures following the end of El Nino meant the warming hiatus or slowdown may be coming back.

‘According to the satellites, the late 2016 temperatures are returning to the levels they were at after the 1998 El Nino. 

The data clearly shows El Nino for what it was – a short-term weather event,’ he said. ",very_low,"Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",2817,"Contrary to what this article implies, the long term global temperature rise is known to be mostly due to human emissions of greenhouse gases. A strong El Niño event helped set a new record in annual global surface temperature in 2015 (and likely again in 2016) by boosting global temperatures on top of the long-term warming trend.
This article is a textbook case of cherry picking—it selects only one record, ignores the limitations of the data it comments on, and forms an argument based on only a few months of a much longer record. This is akin to claiming that sea level rise has ended because high tide in one area has ebbed.

","This is an incredibly misleading article. It cherry picks a dataset taking measurements 2 miles up in the atmosphere only over land areas that disagrees with the other two datasets that examine the same values. The author of the dataset they use specifically warns against using it due to errors in measurement times. Literally all other surface and satellite datasets show no corresponding massive decline, either over land or globally. The author is taking a normal modest cooling at the end of a large El Niño event and spinning it completely out of proportion.
In reality, 2014, 2015, and 2016 have been the three warmest years on record not just because of a large El Niño, but primarily because of a long-term warming trend driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases. The modest decline in temperatures in recent months from the peak of the El Niño event is completely in line with what has happened during past large El Niño events and was expected by scientists.

","This article is flawed to perfection. Mr. Rose made the following inadvisable choices:
1. Ignore the surface temperature record and use only satellite data. Satellites do not measure temperature, they measure microwave radiation, which can be related to an estimate of temperature by use of a computer model. The resulting estimate is, however, not only of temperature at the surface of the Earth—which is where we live—but includes temperature at altitudes of thousands of feet—where no one is trying to farm or grow tomatoes.
2. Ignore two-thirds of the satellite record. Most of the Earth is covered in ocean, and global warming is called global warming because it is global—that is, it includes the oceans.
3. Ignore the trend and focus on two data points. A long-standing trick of people who deny the overwhelming scientific consensus regarding climate change is to cherry-pick isolated observations. The only way to support the claim of a 1-degree drop in the satellite record is by comparing February 2016 to October 2016. This drop, however, is merely weather that is superimposed on the long-term climatic trend.

","The discussion in the article of a disagreement among scientists as to whether the record-breaking global heat in 2015 and again in 2016 was “due to El Niño” vs. “due to global warming” is completely bogus. Both global warming and El Niño, added together, produced these records. El Niño by itself could never have produced such a warm planet as we have now. Everyone, including NASA’s Gavin Schmidt, has been pointing out for some time that temperatures would dip for a while once the El Niño faded, but that’s just a bump on the road to a warmer and warmer planet.

",,"Ed Hawkins, Principal Research Fellow, National Centre for Atmospheric Science:","Overall the article is made highly misleading by omitting critical information and cherry-picking one particular dataset and time period. It also incorrectly interprets comments from climate scientists.

","Benjamin Horton, Professor, Earth Observatory of Singapore
","The claim that global land temperatures have plunged by a record margin is false because: (1) the author cherry picks the data, relying on the satellite record of Earth’s temperature, which only dates to 1978 rather than the surface temperature record which dates to the 19th century. Using the full dataset the decrease in land-based temperature is NOT a record drop; (2) the author IGNORES THE OCEANS. When combining both the land and ocean, there is not a record fall in the satellite record; and (3) the surface temperature record shows an unmistakably upward trend, irrespective of year-to-year wiggles.

","Victor Venema, Scientist, University of Bonn, Germany
",It is a pity the rating scale does not allow for rating below “very low”. Had the article honestly shown a graph of the global surface temperature increase in the last century every reader would have seen how deceptive David Rose’s article is.,"Kyle Armour, Assistant Professor, University of Washington
","It is well known that global temperature falls after receiving a temporary boost from El Niño. The author cherry-picks the slight cooling at the end of the current El Niño to suggest that the long-term global warming trend has ended. It has not.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Some scientists, including Dr Gavin Schmidt, head of Nasa’s climate division, have claimed that the recent highs were mainly the result of long-term global warming.”

","Dr. Gavin Schmidt, who is head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and not any of the NASA divisions, is right. The long-term warming of about 1°C globally—and more over land or in the Northern Hemisphere—is much larger than the El Niño fluctuations.

",,,,"“Others have argued that the records were caused by El Nino […] The new fall in temperatures suggests they were right.”

","Incorrect. We have seen more than 1°C of warming which is largely due to human activities. The strong El Niño has added around 0.1°C temporarily. Therefore, the largest cause of the record temperatures is human activities.

",,,,"“This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter – because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year.”","It is virtually certain that 2016 will be warmer than 2015. See for example this estimate of the 2016 average temperature based on the GISS data up to October.

","Even without the big El Niño spike, 2016 will be the hottest year on record, and 2015 the second hottest. Scientists have methods to remove the effect of El Niño on the temperature record. We can also see this in a simple example where we just remove the big El Niño-related temperature spike, but 2016 remains the warmest year in the surface temperature record:

",,,"“Dr. Schmidt also denied that there was any ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’ in global warming between the 1998 and 2015 El Ninos.”

","If you want to cherry pick 1998 as the beginning year—a year in which the temperature was high due to El Niño—it would at least be fair to stop in 2016, not 2015, because 2016 is the year that the temperatures were highest due to El Niño. If you do so, there is clearly no “slowdown”.
Better would be not to cherry-pick a specific period. The long-term trend is clearly warming and statistics do not indicate any decline in the warming rate. Since 2016, I would argue you no longer need statistics to see this. Just look at the complete graph.

",,,,"“Professor Judith Curry, of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, said yesterday: ‘I disagree with Gavin. The record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were primarily caused by the super El Nino.’”
","It seems kind of pointless to try to precisely attribute why one year was warmer or cooler than the last; this is basically just due to climate variability (including but not limited to El Niño). The broader point is that all evidence suggests that the long-term global surface warming trend has continued. There is no evidence that the rate of warming since 1998 is statistically different from the long-term trend since 1950.

",,,,"“The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end.”

","The modest decline in temperatures in the past few months is a normal reversion after the end of the El Niño event. It has relatively little impact on the longer-term warming trend, which is the most scientifically relevant metric of climate change.

","We have had 3 record warm years: 2014, 2015, and likely 2016. Also when Bayern München loses a game, they are still be best team in Germany—when 2017 is not again a record year, global warming will continue.",,,"“The fall, revealed by Nasa satellites, has been caused by the end of El Nino”","The temperature estimates come from passive microwave radiometers. These instruments’ prime task is estimating air humidity for meteorology—weather prediction. Thus most of the these instruments actually flew on NOAA satellites. It should be noted that they were not designed to be used for long-term climate monitoring.

","Temperature averages from satellite-based detectors are very noisy, and tend to exaggerate swings due to El Niño compared with other data sources. I would not attach much significance to big upswings or downswings over periods of only a few months, especially when other indicators, like sea ice, are suggesting acceleration of warmth. The long-term upward trend is clear in every source of data we have.",,,"“Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record.”

","It is known that El Niño, an oscillation in the tropical Pacific, is a cause of short-term fluctuations of the temperature and precipitation. This should not be confused with long-term warming. This is clearly illustrated by this graph below that shows the warming of El Niño years, La Niña years (the opposite of El Niño), and neutral years individually.

","The image in the Daily Mail is deceptive as it only shows the part of the data (in the red box of the graph below). With all the problems of this dataset, it also shows long-term warming if you look at the full ","The time series used in the central image is highly misleading, as it only shows some of the data available and therefore disguises the increase seen before the chosen period.

","This is not true for global surface temperatures, not true for land surface temperatures, not true for global temperatures 2 miles up in the atmosphere, and not true for two of the three datasets that provide temperatures 2 miles up in the atmosphere only over land areas. It’s a truly breathtaking example of cherry-picking.
Furthermore, the folks who created the dataset that Rose cites (Remote Sensing Systems) note that there is a serious error in their data and warn:“The lower tropospheric (TLT) temperatures have not yet been updated at this time and remain V3.3. The V3.3 TLT data suffer from the same problems with the adjustment for drifting measurement times that led us to update the TMT dataset. V3.3 TLT data should be used with caution.”","“According to the satellites, the late 2016 temperatures are returning to the levels they were at after the 1998 El Nino.”

","Not based on any evidence. Just like the warming peak due to El Niño was higher in 2016 than in 1998, the period after 2016 will be warmer than the years after 1998 due to the progress of global warming.

","Even according to satellite records, which have their issues, this is not remotely the case:

"Analysis of “Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has worst coral die-off ever”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/great-barrier-reef-australia-coral-die-off-doyle-rice-usa-today/,Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has worst coral die-off ever,http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/sciencefair/2016/11/28/great-barrier-reef-australia-coral-die-off/94554934/,"One of the world’s treasures, the Great Barrier Reef, just suffered from its worst coral die-off ever recorded, Australian scientists announced Monday.

Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off. ""The coral was cooked,” Terry Hughes, director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, told the BBC.

At more than 1,400 miles long, Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef and the planet's biggest structure made by living organisms. In the northernmost section of the reef, which had been considered the most ""pristine,"" some 67% of the coral died. 

The good news, scientists said, was that central and southern sections of the reef fared far better, with ""only"" 6% and 1% of the coral dead, respectively.

Coral reefs result from the work of little polyps, creatures only a few millimeters long, budded on top of one another. Over centuries, the shells of these creatures combine to form the exotic shapes of coral reefs. Tiny differences in the anatomy of each polyp species affect the shape of their shells and produce the exotic shapes of each reef.

The vibrant colors that draw thousands of tourists to the Great Barrier Reef each year come from algae that live in the corals tissue. When water temperatures become too high, coral becomes stressed and expels the algae, which leave the coral a bleached white color.

Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.

Besides their beauty, reefs shelter land from storms, and are also a habitat for myriads of species. 

""Coral reefs are therefore the most biologically diverse ecosystems of the planet, and provide a number of ecosystem services that hundreds of millions of people rely on,"" said Greg Torda, also of the Centre, in an e-mail to USA TODAY.

""These include provisioning (fishing, other types of harvesting, for pharmaceuticals, for example), coastal protection, aesthetic and cultural values – to name a few. If corals are lost, so are all the services they provide to humans; and so are all the species that directly or indirectly rely on them.""

Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef employs 70,000 people, and generates $5 billion (Australian) in income each year, the Centre said in a statement.

The good news is that much of the coral survived this bleaching event. But looking to the future, mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef will likely be an annual phenomenon within a decade, Torda said. 

If all the coral died on the reef, “it would be among the largest mass extinction events in history,” said Torda.","high, very_high","Accurate, Sound reasoning, Unbiased",108,"This article in USA Today reports on the latest survey of mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef released by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. This year, the northern portion of the reef has seen the worst bleaching ever observed with two-thirds of coral dead on average—even more in some locations. Southern sections of the reef experienced much less bleaching and death because of slightly cooler water.

The article correctly notes that climate change is making this kind of mass bleaching event more frequent, putting tropical reefs at risk. Reefs are ecosystems incredibly rich in biodiversity, and they provide economic value through tourism, fishing, and protection against coastal erosion.",,,,,"Mark Eakin, Scientist, Coordinator of NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:","In general, the article got this one almost completely right, with one of my two quibbles being in one of the experts’ quotes. It is unfortunate, however, that the article didn’t put this story in the context of the global coral bleaching event that is still underway—currently hitting hardest in Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

","Katrin Meissner, Professor, University of New South Wales:","This article is mostly accurate. The author made one overstatement (that we will see yearly massive bleaching events at the Great Barrier Reef within the next decade). It should be noted, though, that the frequency of massive bleaching events is increasing, will continue to increase in the near future, and that these events do not need to occur annually to kill the reef. The variability of El Niño Southern Oscillation on top of the background warming trend of surface temperatures means that we will exceed the bleaching thresholds more frequently. In the future, the reefs won’t have time to recover between these events.

","James Renwick, Professor, Victoria University of Wellington:","This is a very good article highlighting one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots and the grave risks it faces. One of two of the comments and ideas are off the mark, but it is largely factually correct.","Lauren Simkins, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia:","Coral bleaching is a visual reminder of the influence of climate change on the world’s oceans and ecosystems. The article presents findings that support a massive bleaching event this year and some of the ecological and economic consequences of coral bleaching. Although lacking in key scientific references to support claims, the article is insightful and unbiased.

","John Bruno, Professor, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
","I concur with my colleagues that this is mostly an accurate article. A few points are exaggerated, as we all noted in the annotated version. And to be clear, this may well be the worse die off on the Great Barrier Reef, but we’ve been seeing die offs of this magnitude and geographic scope around the world for decades.

For example, coral reefs across the Caribbean experienced a die off of similar-to-larger scope 35 years ago. My entire career, I’ve been studying “post mass-coral die off” reefs in Jamaica, Belize, Cuba, etc. So in this regard, the event isn’t especially notable. The real lesson of the GBR coral mortality of 2016 isn’t that ocean warming is causing mass-coral die offs – we’ve known that for a quarter century. It is that even the world’s most remote, well-managed, and otherwise pristine reefs are susceptible.

Many of my colleagues have assumed and argued that ocean warming only causes mass coral mortality in the presence of other insults to the reef. Stressors like overfishing, pollution, tourism, etc. that were believed to weaken “natural resilience” to ocean warming. I co-authored a paper earlier this year* that found that reef isolation had no effect on coral loss – the world’s most isolated reefs, free from local human impacts, were just as degraded in terms of the amount of remaining living coral as reefs adjacent to large population centers. The bottom line is that no form of local management can save reefs from carbon emissions.

Bruno and Valdivia (2016) Coral reef degradation is not correlated with local human population density, Nature scientific reports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Scientists confirm a mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef this year has killed more corals than ever before, with more than two thirds destroyed across large swathes of the biodiverse site.” ","Actually, this is an underestimate as the “25% of the worst affected reefs (the top quartile), losses of corals ranged from 83-99%.”

How much coral has died in the Great Barrier Reef’s worst bleaching event?",,,,"“When water temperatures become too high, coral becomes stressed and expels the algae, which leave the coral a bleached white color.”

","The article should have noted that, while injured and starving, bleached corals are still alive. When thermal stress is severe or prolonged, corals often die. Thermally-stressed corals also frequently die due to disease outbreaks.

","The pattern of warming this year resulted in the highest thermal stress being located in the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef. This can be seen in the coral bleaching products from NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch.
",,,,"“Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off.”

","Yes, human-caused warming boosts the background temperature, so that warming associated with El Niño can now reach levels intolerable by corals.

","Roughly speaking, the El Niño may have added a quarter of a degree C to the global average in 2015/16, while the greenhouse-gas-related warming trend has added twice that much to the average values since the 1980s.
It’s also important to note that this is only one part of a global coral bleaching event that has been occurring since mid-2014.

","Correct.

 ","On the Great Barrier Reef, I believe this is true. Global (especially tropical) temperatures took a jump upwards in the late 1970s, providing the extra warmth that puts corals in danger.",,,"“[…]looking to the future, mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef will likely be an annual phenomenon within a decade, Torda said.”

","This may turn out to be true but most studies place annual bleaching, especially on the Great Barrier Reef, a bit further out—perhaps 2050.

van Hooidonk et al (2013) Temporary refugia for coral reefs in a warming world, Nature Climate Change
","This sentence is an overstatement. See, for example, Meissner et al. (2012)*: “By year 2030, 66–85% of the reef locations considered in this study would experience severe bleaching events at least once every 10 years. Regardless of the concentration pathway, virtually every reef considered in this study (>97%) would experience severe thermal stress by year 2050.” Having said that, mass coral bleaching events do not need to be an annual phenomenon to kill the reef. Coral reefs need years to recover from extreme bleaching events, which means that even a decadal occurrence of severe bleaching will not give the reef enough time to ever recover. While this sentence is an overstatement, the impact on the reef is the same.

"Analysis of “Amid higher global temperatures, sea ice at record lows at poles”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/higher-global-temperatures-sea-ice-record-lows-poles-brandon-miller-cnn/,"Amid higher global temperatures, sea ice at record lows at poles",http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/world/sea-ice-arctic-antarctic-lows/,"CNN —  
For what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track, sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year.

“It looks like, since the beginning of October, that for the first time we are seeing both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice running at record low levels,” said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, who has tracked sea ice data going back to 1979.

While record low sea ice is nothing new in the Arctic, this is a surprising turn of events for the Antarctic. Even as sea ice in the Arctic has seen a rapid and consistent decline over the past decade, its counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere has seen its extent increasing.

In fact, each year from 2012 through 2014 reached a record high for Antarctic sea ice extent. Skeptics have long pointed to ice gain in the Southern Hemisphere as evidence climate change wasn’t occurring, but scientists warned that it was caused by natural variations and circulations in the atmosphere.

While it is too early to know if the recent, rapid decline in Antarctic sea ice is going to be a regular occurrence like in the Arctic, it “certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica’s ice is just going up and up,” Meier said.

The decline of sea ice has been a key indicator that climate change is happening, but its loss, especially in the Arctic, can mean major changes for your weather, too.

What’s going on in the Arctic?
Temperatures in the Arctic have soared recently, and scientists are struggling to explain exactly why, and what the consequences will be. Air temperatures have been running more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) above average.

At the same time, sea ice in the northern latitudes is at a lower level than ever observed for this time of the year. October and November are typically a time of rapid ice gain for the Arctic region, as daylight hours become shorter and shorter and eventually non-existent during what’s referred to as the “polar night.” Air temperatures plummet to below zero degrees Fahrenheit and parts of the Arctic Ocean not covered with ice quickly become covered. But this year, those air temperatures are staying much warmer, closer to the freezing mark of 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

When you compare 2016 Arctic sea ice to 1984, multiyear ice (white color) is on the decline.

To make matters worse, the water temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are several degrees above average, which is an expected result of having less sea ice. With less ice in the summer, more of the sun’s rays can heat the darker water, as opposed to being deflected back into space by the white ice cover. The result is a feedback loop, and one that scientists have warned about for some time.

“The interaction between Arctic ocean temperatures and the loss of ice formation leading to continuing record minimums is clearly a climate change signal,” said Thomas Mote, a geography research professor at the University of Georgia.

As it becomes clearer that the entire climate system in the Arctic, and potentially the Antarctic, is changing rapidly, the question now is what the impacts will be.

Why does it matter to us?
When it comes to the weather in the Arctic, it’s the anti-Vegas, Meier said: “What happens in the Arctic DOES NOT stay in the Arctic.”

The Arctic region impacts the weather in the rest of the planet – in particular, North America, Europe and Asia.

During the Northern Hemisphere’s winter, the arctic cold regularly “spills out” into the continents and can usher in major cold air outbreaks with crippling snow and ice storms, along with dangerously cold temperatures. Usually, this is regulated by the polar vortex that circles the North Pole several miles up in the stratosphere – not to be confused with the “polar vortex” nickname that’s been attached to every cold snap and snowstorm in recent years.

Any change in the polar vortex would mean a change in the frequency and intensity of winter storms in the areas where most people live.

Researchers are looking at one such theory, which considers a warm Arctic and cold continents – basically, a warmer Arctic featuring less sea ice that leads to more frequent spilling of cold air that’s normally trapped by the polar vortex. That would mean the continents are hit with more frequent shots of Arctic air. Even though that Arctic air might not be as cold as normal, it is still plenty frigid to wreak havoc on populated places, locking them into long cold spells and major snow storms.

There’s a classic example of it happening right now. Large swaths of Europe and Asia have seen bitter cold and record snows over the past several weeks, all while the Arctic was bathing in temperatures 30 degrees Fahrenheit above average.

It’s far too early to tell if what we are seeing in the Arctic, and now the Antarctic, is a sharp shift towards warmer poles with less ice. Scientists are quick to point out that weather in these regions can change quickly, but this is another expected result of climate change. And enough examples can become trends – and trends can have consequences.",very_high,"Accurate, Insightful, Unbiased",139,"This CNN article discusses the unprecedented recent warm sea surface and air temperatures leading to the record low Arctic extent. It also explores the potential influence this long-term trend of sea ice loss may have on the polar vortex and weather patterns in the midlatitudes.

Scientists reviewing the article found that it is an accurate and insightful summary of current scientific knowledge, which indicates that warming is driving a long-term decline in Arctic sea ice coverage—though sea ice at both poles is subject to shorter-term variability, as well.

",,,,,"Michel Tsamados, Lecturer (Assistant Professor), University College London:","The article does a good job of conveying our current understanding of the state of the sea ice in the 21st century.

The very low total Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent in October 2016 is a clear outlier with respect to the last ~40 years.

","This is slightly confusing, since it can refer to either sea ice gain or land ice gain (which were both mentioned by “skeptics”). The sea ice gain since 2000 has been attributed to natural, decadal variability in the tropical Pacific*. Land ice gain is a false claim, and mostly refers to slight thickening of the East Antarctic interior, which is more than compensated by dynamic ice loss in West Antarctica.

",,,,"“It “certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica’s ice is just going up and up,” Meier said.”","I agree that the statement that Antarctic sea ice going up and up is a misconception when looked at over larger time scales.

On the other hand it is also true that over the satellite area Antarctic sea ice has increased in extent (a bit) every month of the year (see NSIDC time series) October is probably the month with the weakest positive trend.

Therefore I believe that it is more important to explain that while the transient response of Antarctic sea ice is more complex than in the Arctic, the end state (equilibrium) is also one with polar amplification, increased temperatures and sea ice decline, in both hemisphere.

",,,,"“For what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track, sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year.”

","While we have a very clear picture of the sea ice concentration only over the satellite era (1979-present) there are other measurements available that are more or less direct, ranging from whaling and shipping log books (showing higher sea ice extent over the past 100 years) to paleo-climate reconstruction (proxies) over thousands to million of years.

Scientists are quick to point out that weather in these regions can change quickly, but this is another expected result of climate change.”

","Certainly the loss of sea ice is largely a result of warming from increased atmospheric concentrations of CO2. So it’s not surprising to see the changes in the Arctic. Climate models also predict that Antarctic sea ice will decline eventually, especially once the ozone hole recovers. There is some evidence* that the ozone hole has led to stronger circumpolar winds that spread the Antarctic sea ice cover out from the continent and since there is no land to bound the sea ice (like in the Arctic) it can expand towards the equator until it reaches warmer ocean temperatures.

Turner and Overland (2009) Contrasting climate change in the two polar regions, Polar Research",,,,"“‘The interaction between Arctic ocean temperatures and the loss of ice formation leading to continuing record minimums is clearly a climate change signal,’ said Thomas Mote, a geography research professor at the University of Georgia.”

","Yes. The “ice-albedo feedback” has been evident in the Arctic for some years, contributing to “polar amplification”—the effect where polar latitudes warm at around twice the rate of the globe as a whole.

",,,,"“Temperatures in the Arctic have soared recently, and scientists are struggling to explain exactly why.”

","The only quibble I have with this article is this statement. I’d say that we have a fairly good understanding of the causes of this warm episode. As mentioned in the article, a very diminished ice cover this summer allowed additional solar energy to be absorbed by the Arctic Ocean, which is then released back to the atmosphere in fall that in turn retards refreezing. Additional moisture is also evaporated from the open ocean, which not only traps additional heat as a greenhouse gas, but also tends to form more clouds that also trap heat. An unusually wavy jet-stream pattern has also transported extra heat and moisture from lower-latitude regions into the Arctic, adding to the warmth. We know many self-reinforcing mechanisms operate in the Arctic, so when some heat shows up there (think greenhouse gases, moisture, etc.), its effects are amplified. This has been understood for a long time, but perhaps the pace of this warming is somewhat unexpected.",,,,"“To make matters worse, the water temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are several degrees above average, which is an expected result of having less sea ice.”

","Generally, the absorbed solar radiation leads to enhanced ocean temperatures in the mixed layer, so with summers of less ice the ocean mixed layer temperatures are usually warmer than average. Though even that is more driven by the timing of when the sea ice retreats. If it retreats early in the melt season when the sun is still high in the sky then you get more ocean warming, but if like in 2012 the ice retreats rapidly in August, it doesn’t have the same impact on ocean temperatures because the sun is already starting to set. But while this may be part of the explanation for warmer ocean temperatures at the moment, in the Barents Sea it is actually a result of warm Atlantic waters entering the Arctic. I have spoken with oceanographers about this and the sea surface temperature anomalies are a result of stronger inflow to the Barents Sea and along the west coast of Svalbard. The strong northwards flow of Atlantic water is also consistent with the more southerly winds this November that have helped to bring in warm air temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The commentary relies on claims that are not supported by any evidence, like the assertion that more CO2 in the atmosphere has helped to reduce poverty.

The authors invite the reader to “check the facts” but do not apply that maxim to themselves. Instead of referring to published scientific research, the article draws heavily from information created by an advocacy group that exists to promote CO2 emissions as beneficial. Taken as a whole, the body of scientific evidence clearly shows that this is not the case.

So it is a strawman statement that may be easily demolished but not relevant to the concern about CO2 and climate change.

","There are many toxic gases that are odorless and colorless. The best known one is, like CO2, also related to combustion: carbon monoxide (CO).

",,,“But a myth persists that is both unscientific and immoral to perpetuate: that the beneficial gas carbon dioxide ranks among hazardous pollutants. It does not.”,"This is semantics. Some call carbon dioxide a “pollutant” and others don’t. What is relevant is that the huge amount of CO2 that humanity has put into the atmosphere is changing the climate significantly. The hazard comes from changes to precipitation and extremes, leading to reduced food security and water availability. No wonder the Pentagon rates climate change as a critical threat to US national security. Just look at what’s happening in Syria and north Africa, on the back of a severe drought and a spike in food prices.

Reference:

Kelley et al (2015) Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences",,,,"“[CO2] is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature.”

","While the presence of CO2 has warmed the atmosphere to “habitable” temperatures, the additional increase of it will bring temperatures way outside habitable ranges in many regions including the oceans, as well as disturbing the water cycle and acidifying the oceans.

",,,,"“But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)”

","That [1 °C warming] is an absolute best-case scenario, if significant mitigation action is taken urgently. Increased CO2 leads to warming, which leads to increased atmospheric water vapor, less ice, and other feedbacks. A doubling of CO2 concentrations would lead to about 3 °C warming.

","Projections of future warming can’t be made from observations alone: we need understanding of the mechanisms and physical processes. Neither of these are provided by the quoted website, which instead contains inaccurate articles about supposed adjustments to temperature data and claiming a new ‘little ice age’ is already here—both of which have been shown to be incorrect by scientific research.

","This is simply not accurate. Global warming is a global issue that, for example, affects global coastal populations, marine ecology, crop stability, and the area of habitable land. Humans, especially in countries with the largest carbon emissions, have been successfully altering the entire Earth system; therefore, climate change is currently the most global issue that we face and will continue to face in the coming centuries.

","It is unclear what costs are referred to here. The regulations themselves cost nothing.

It is the damage costs that will be “paid by everyone”, not the emission reductions.",,,"“In 2013 the level of U.S. farm output was about 2.7 times its 1948 level, and productivity was growing at an average annual rate of 1.52%.

However, it’s generally considered to be a fraction of those. We know better future effects because we have CO2 fertilization experiments in the field comparing present to future CO2 levels. Those experiments suggest that corn may have about a 1% gain [because of increased CO2] and soybeans 3-4 times that. However, these gains will almost certainly be offset by yield declines associated with the temperature increases caused by elevated CO2, which are well known.

Historically, it’s worth noting that we had elevated CO2 long before we had the green revolution, and crop yields didn’t increase much until the green revolution. You can see this in graphs of average US corn yields from 1900.

",,,,"“With more CO2 in the atmosphere, the challenge [feeding 2.5 billion more people] can and will be met.”

","There is absolutely no scientific study that would support such a conclusion. And even if there was no climate effect of CO2, a simple speculative growth enhancement by CO2 could not produce such an effect.

"Analysis of “Hillary Clinton Boards The Climate Crisis Train To Nowhere”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/hillary-clinton-boards-climate-crisis-train-nowhere-roy-spencer-forbes/,Hillary Clinton Boards The Climate Crisis Train To Nowhere,http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2016/10/25/hillary-clinton-boards-the-climate-crisis-train-to-nowhere/,"Hillary Clinton and Al Gore spoke at Miami-Dade College on October 11 about the “climate crisis” that Gore has been trying to convince us about for 20 years. Just as in Gore’s movie An Inconvenient Truth, weather disasters that have always occurred have been repurposed to support the climate change narrative, with the claim those disasters are getting worse.

Meanwhile, Chapman University has released a survey of the top ten issues Americans fear the most.

Guess what? Climate change didn’t make the list. Instead, corruption of politicians was the No. 1 worry.

For those who don’t see the relationship between these two newsworthy events, let me connect the dots for you.

Global warming and climate change, even if it is 100% caused by humans, is so slow that it cannot be observed by anyone in their lifetime. Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long-term change. This means that in order for politicians to advance policy goals (such as forcing expensive solar energy on the masses or creating a carbon tax), they have to turn normal weather disasters into “evidence” of climate change.

As a climate researcher, I will agree that humans have likely contributed to a portion of recent warmth. I am not a denier of either natural or human-induced climate change.

But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening.

Furthermore, the overall increases in such things as hurricanes and tornadoes have not materialized. Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega-droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past.

Lake-bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past. Strong Sandy-type storms occur every year in all the major ocean basins… they just don’t happen to hit major metropolitan areas. It has now, even after Hurricane Matthew, been over 4,000 days since a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) has made landfall in the U.S.

Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years. If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade? If Hillary would have fact-checked her example of sea level rise in Norfolk, Virginia, she would have found out that the experts already know this is mostly due to the land there sinking.

To the extent that the cost of weather disasters has risen over time, that is well known to be the result of modern society building more infrastructure in areas that are prone to damage from weather—which is almost everywhere.

So, to keep the masses alarmed, politicians must claim that what is normal is actually abnormal—and getting worse. And, furthermore, that only they can fix it … and thereby save your children and grandchildren.

And it is that “fix” that really sinks any current plan politicians have to address climate change. Even the modern godfather of global warming, ex-NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies director James Hansen, has admitted that the Paris climate agreement is “a fraud really, a fake.” This is because even if the countries of the world agree to do what they promised on climate change, and that climate change is entirely our fault, and that climate change really will ultimately get bad, the promised actions will have no measurable effect on future global temperatures.

You see, many of those countries that have signed on to the Paris Agreement aren’t signing up to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They are signing up for wealth transfers from the minority of advanced countries to the majority of poor countries.

And you can’t even fix the problem with a new agreement. Why? Because until we develop a practical, cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels, it is unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15-20% of global energy requirements. The amount of energy necessary for humans to do everything we do is simply too large. As that demand for energy grows, the amount of renewable energy also has to grow, just to maintain only a 15-20% fraction of the total.

So, until people actually experience climate change, and new energy technologies are developed, any claims by politicians that we are in a “climate crisis” will fall on deaf ears. And since the biggest risk to humanity is poverty, if we allow policymakers to have their way, the resulting energy poverty will indeed cause the deaths of some of our children and grandchildren.

","Benjamin Horton, Professor, Earth Observatory of Singapore:","The discussion on sea level rise is misleading.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Global warming and climate change, even if it is 100% caused by humans, is so slow that it cannot be observed by anyone in their lifetime. Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long-term change.”

","This statement is far too broad to be supportable, and is misleading in a few ways. Among the many aspects and impacts of climate change, some are evolving slowly and others more quickly (quickly enough to be detected within a 70-year human lifetime). There is a very important difference between saying “there has been no change”, versus “the data records are not long enough to formally detect a change”. For example, our present records of hurricanes do in fact show very large and statistically significant increasing trends in a number of measures since the 1800s. But we also know that the older data are of a lower quality than modern data, so we are uncertain of what part of the trends are due to the data issues and what part may be due to human influences.

The scientific community has established a very strict set of rules for formally establishing whether or not a trend has been detected, and we constrain our statements within this rigid framework. The author’s statement here violates those rules and is unsupportable

","As others have noted, this is flat out wrong. With barely 1C of global warming there are already changes in temperatures, humidity precipitation patterns, sea ice, land ice, sea level, vegetation, etc., that i) can be observed, and ii) can be attributed to human-made global warming. And certainly in the coming decades, that is, within our “lifetime”, further changes are going to be even more obvious.",,,"“Furthermore, the overall increases in such things as hurricanes and tornadoes have not materialized.”

","Again, this statement is not supported by the science. We are seeing changes. We just don’t have long enough data records to formally detect the changes and attribute them to human influence. The rules of detection and attribution are well established, strict, and conservative. The author’s statement here is outside of the rules and can’t be supported in any true formal scientific sense. […] It’s wrong and unsupportable to say that there have been no changes. Our theory of hurricanes and our best numerical models inform us that hurricanes will become stronger as the world warms, and that the increase will be most evident in the strongest hurricanes. These are the hurricanes that kill the most people and do the most damage.

Furthermore, increases in strength or number are not the only ways that hurricanes can change. There is mounting evidence that tropical cyclones in various regions of the world are migrating poleward. This creates significant changes in hazard exposure and human mortality risk, even in the absence of any changes in strength.

",,,,“Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega-droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past.”,"There are many scientific papers, going back years now, that show the influence of climate changes on the western US droughts. The fact that there have been “mega-droughts” in the past is irrelevant to whether climate changes are now influencing current droughts.

","In Swain et al. (2014)*, we do find that global warming has increased the likelihood of one of the “ingredients” of the California drought—specifically, very high middle atmospheric pressures. A more direct reference might be Diffenbaugh et al. (2015)*, where we specifically quantify the degree to which human caused warming has increased the likelihood of drought in California. There are other papers, as well, that find at least a fractional contribution of warming to this event.

I also agree with Peter Gleick’s remark that the existence of past droughts of large magnitude is largely irrelevant when seeking causes of the present one, and does not disprove a human role in modern droughts.

",,"“Lake-bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past.”

","The lake-bottom sediment study, in which I participated, catalogued hurricanes at a particular location over several thousand years. There are indeed centennial-scale variations at particular locations that are not strongly correlated across different locations, so the authors interpreted these fluctuations in terms of changing [hurricane] tracks. The technique cannot distinguish between a weak event nearby and a strong one at a distance, so there is little data pertaining to storm intensity.

",,,,"“ It has now, even after Hurricane Matthew, been over 4,000 days since a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) has made landfall in the U.S. ”

","The definition of US major hurricane landfall is strict but also arbitrary, and isn’t a particularly good measure of coastal risk. The threshold of a major hurricane, and the restriction that the center of a hurricane must move over land is somewhat ad hoc and may obfuscate the points of relevance. For example, many coastal communities have experienced major hurricane landfalls over the past 4,000 days. They just don’t happen to be within the geopolitical border of the contiguous US. Matthew is in fact a good example for why the author’s statement is misleading. Matthew did a great deal of damage as a major hurricane without technically having its center touch land. The fact that it didn’t make formal landfall as a major hurricane is not particularly relevant when considering coastal hazard exposure and human mortality risk.

","One can always cherry-pick a sufficiently narrow statistic, like major landfalling continental US hurricane, that will support one’s prejudice. The fact is that there has been no pause in ALL Atlantic basin or landfalling (including regions outside the US) storms.",,,"“Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years. If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about","Proxy analysis has clearly shown an acceleration in rate of sea-level rise. Our research* found that the rate of sea-level rise on the US Atlantic coast is greater now than at any time in the past 2,000 years. The research also shows a consistent link between global mean surface temperature and changes in sea level for the past millennium. The study shows that after relatively subtle changes in temperature and sea-level rise over the last 2,000 years, the rate of sea-level rise increased in the late 19th century.

Sea-level rise contributes significantly to the frequency of flooding from hurricanes. The contribution from sea-level rise to flood height works in together with other factors such as timing of the storm relative to high tide, and the strength and direction of individual hurricanes. Sea-level rise between hurricanes raises the “baseline” water level and makes flooding more likely. We published another paper* showing that New York City can expect nine-foot floods, as intense as that produced by 2012’s Superstorm Sandy, at least four times more frequently over the next century. We report that floods as intense as Sandy’s would have occurred about once every 400 years on average under present day sea-level rise conditions, but that over the 21st century are expected to be about four times more probable (once every 100 years) due to an acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise.

Kemp et al. (2011) Climate related sea-level variations over the past two millennia, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
Lin et al. (2016) Hurricane Sandy’s flood frequency increasing from year 1800 to 2100, Proceedings","A major storm that has a sea-level higher than it would otherwise have been without climate change will simply be more damaging. It doesn’t matter that current sea-level rise changes are slow. Sandy’s storm surge hit at high tide—a tide that was higher than it would otherwise have been because of human-caused climate change. Some estimates are that damages were many billions of dollars higher as a result.

","Sea level rise is indeed accelerating and is currently tracking predictions that are consistent with a roughly 1 meter (3 foot) rise by the end of the century. We are already seeing bad effects in places like Miami Beach. And 1 meter makes a large difference, so if one is concerned about one’s descendants, then yes, it is something to worry about.

","Sea level rise and its impacts vary considerably by region. To state a global mean number is misleading and irrelevant to those regions that are most vulnerable. With or without hurricanes added to the mix, the impacts on humans from sea level rise can be seen now. The author’s comparison of hurricane storm surge to sea level rise is very misleading and blurs the relevance of sea level rise to humans. Sea level rise is creating nuisance flooding in a number of places. The fact that hurricane storm surge is bigger is irrelevant and does not change the fact that people are being impacted.

","“If Hillary would have fact-checked her example of sea level rise in Norfolk, Virginia, she would have found out that the experts already know this is mostly due to the land there sinking.”

","Benjamin Horton, Professor, Earth Observatory of Singapore:
Without global warming, global sea level would have risen by less than half the observed 20th century increase and might even have fallen. We published another paper in PNAS (Kopp et al., 2016*) that showed that with global warming global sea level rose by about 14 centimeters, or 5.5 inches, from 1900 to 2000. That is a substantial increase, especially for vulnerable, low-lying coastal areas. The sinking of land in Virginia is responsible for the slow sea-level rise from 3000 years ago to the beginning of the industrial revolution. The 20th century rise was extraordinary in the context of the last three millennia—and the rise over the last two decades has been even faster. The study’s global sea-level reconstruction calculated how temperatures relate to the rate of sea-level change. Based on this relationship, the study found that, without global warming, 20th century global sea-level change would very likely have been between a decrease of 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) and a rise of 7 centimeters (2.8 inches). A companion report finds that, without the global warming-induced component of sea-level rise, more than half of the 8,000 coastal nuisance floods observed at studied US tide gauge sites since 1950 would not have occurred.

Kopp et al. (2016) Temperature-driven global sea-level variability in the Common Era, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences",,,,"“[…]even if the countries of the world agree to do what they promised on climate change, […]the promised actions will have no measurable effect on future global temperatures.”

","The current promises of governments around the world (INDCs) are not enough to stay below a warming of 2 °C, but they do make a difference. In an article in Nature this June, Joeri Rogelj and colleagues: “The INDCs collectively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to where current policies stand, but still imply a median warming of 2.6–3.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.”",,,,"“[…]until we develop a practical, cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels, it is unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15-20% of global energy requirements.”

","In many countries renewables are already competitive compared to fossil fuels, and represent a larger share than the 15-20% mentioned here. Costs of renewable are still falling. And the investment in renewable is accelerating. For instance, the IEA has revised its renewable forecasts upwards. Many scenarios and studies foresee that renewables could represent a much larger share than 15-20%.

","Dr. Spencer provides no evidence to back up his assertion that renewables are necessarily limited to 15%-20% of generation. Prices of renewable technologies have been falling rapidly over the past decade, with solar power alone falling 60% and wind falling 40%. In more and more parts of the world renewables are cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuels. And unlike traditional fuels, renewables are not mature technologies and likely have additional price reductions to come.

In some areas additional storage might be needed to balance out high renewable penetration. Even here storage costs have fallen dramatically due to advances in battery technologies. Additionally, electric vehicles and natural gas both enable additional renewables through grid balancing.

",,,"“And since the biggest risk to humanity is poverty, if we allow policymakers to have their way, the resulting energy poverty will indeed cause the deaths of some of our children and grandchildren.”

","Poverty and energy poverty are indeed a risk for humanity; but current understanding shows that unmitigated climate change would hinder the efforts of poverty alleviation, because climate change impacts bear on most vulnerable countries and people.

","There is no necessary tradeoff between fighting poverty and climate change. There are actually a number of co-benefits to a more sustainable development pathway. For example, outdoor air pollution driven largely by coal use currently kills well over a million people annually*, and represents one of the most urgent public health crises on the planet. Addressing it by transitioning from coal to renewables, nuclear, and natural gas could benefit both health and the environment in developing countries.

Rohde (2015) Air Pollution in China: Mapping of Concentrations and Sources, PLOS ONE",,,"“But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening.”

","The statement is fairly accurate but leaves the inference of causes up to the reader. A recent paper by Santer et al. (2016)* investigated this issue in considerable detail. For middle tropospheric temperatures the paper found that, on average, models showed 1.71 times more warming than the mean of the most recent version of the satellite data for the 1979-2015 period. This is for near global mean temperatures. For the lower troposphere, the models show about 2 times more warming than the satellites. Note that the Remote Sensing Systems lower tropospheric dataset has not yet been upgraded to the latest version, which is likely to show more warming.

The article does not discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, but given the tone of the rest of the article, the reader is expected to use the trend differences as evidence that long-term projections by climate models are suspect. These ratios do not provide such evidence. At least part of the discrepancy is known to be caused by errors in the forcings used to drive the CMIP-5 climate models. After the year 2000, the CMIP-5 models were driven by forecast values for important parameters such as volcanic aerosols, solar output, and stratospheric ozone. The forecasts turned out to be slightly inaccurate, causing the models to predict more warming than they would have if the correct forcings had been used. (Of course, these correct forcings were in the future and thus unknowable at the time the model computations were performed). Other possible causes include natural variability in the real world (which might produce a period of reduced warming) and errors in the model physics. Only errors in the model physics would cause long-term global warming to be overestimated, and there is no significant evidence that supports large errors in the model physics. Over a much longer time period, 1880-present, the warming at the surface agrees well with that expected by the CMIP-5 models. The longer time period is important because the effects of random fluctuations due to natural variability tend to average away as the time period considered gets longer.

"Analysis of “About Those Non-Disappearing Pacific Islands”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/sea-level-rise-those-non-disappearing-pacific-islands-bjorn-lomborg-wall-street-journal/,About Those Non-Disappearing Pacific Islands,https://www.wsj.com/articles/about-those-non-disappearing-pacific-islands-1476400840,"Once a year or so, journalists from major news outlets travel to the Marshall Islands, a remote chain of volcanic islands and coral atolls in the Pacific Ocean, to report in panicked tones that the island nation is vanishing because of climate change. Their dispatches are often filled with raw emotion and suggest that residents are fleeing atolls swiftly sinking into the sea.

Yet new research shows that this is not the entire—or even an accurate—picture. Acknowledging this doesn’t mean that global warming isn’t real, or that world leaders and scientists shouldn’t tackle the adverse effects of climate change, but hype and exaggeration serve no one.

Using historic aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite imagery, Auckland University scientists Murray Ford and Paul Kench recently analyzed shoreline changes on six atolls and two mid-ocean reef islands in the Marshall Islands. Their peer-reviewed study, published in the September 2015 issue of Anthropocene, revealed that since the middle of the 20th century the total land area of the islands has actually grown.

How is that possible? It seems self-evident that rising sea levels will reduce land area. However, there is a process of accretion, where coral broken up by the waves washes up on these low-lying islands as sand, counteracting the reduction in land mass. Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain.

This is not only true for the Marshall Islands. The researchers write that within the “recently emerging body of shoreline change studies on atoll islands there is little evidence of widespread reef island erosion. To the contrary, several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation [growth] and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century, resulting in a net increase in island area.” The most famous of these studies, published in 2010 by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji, showed that of 27 Pacific islands, 14% lost area. Yet 43% gained area, with the rest remaining stable.

Representatives from the Marshall Islands have been vocal about the need for strong global action on climate. President Hilda Heine has told reporters that longtime residents are leaving the Marshall Islands because climate change is threatening the nation’s existence. It’s true that approximately one-third of the population has relocated to the U.S.—but for reasons more mundane than climate change.

Some 52.7% of the Marshall Islands population lives below the poverty line, according to the Asian Development Bank. Only 39.3% of the population age 15 years and above is employed. In its 2015 human-rights report on the island nation, the U.S. State Department said that significant problems include “chronic government corruption, and chronic domestic violence,” along with “child abuse, sex trafficking, and lack of legal provisions protecting worker’s rights.” Marshallese citizens also have an easy immigration pathway to America and can live, work and study in the U.S. without a visa.

It is understandable why Marshall Island leaders might prefer to talk about global warming. But blaming today’s emigration on rising seas does a disservice to all.

Telling viewers in the U.S. starkly that they’re “making this island disappear,” as a report from CNN’s John Sutter did in June 2015, makes for good, blame-laden television. But this reductionist, fact-averse rhetoric contributes to the idea that climate-change discussion should be a two-sided, cartoonish fight between those who say it is not real and those who say it is the worst problem facing humanity.

Even more insidiously, doom-mongering makes us panic and seize upon the wrong responses to global warming. At a cost of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion annually, the Paris climate agreement, recently ratified by China, is likely to be history’s most expensive treaty. It will slow the world’s economic growth to force a shift to inefficient green energy sources.

This will achieve almost nothing. My peer-reviewed research, published last November in the journal Global Policy, shows that even if every nation were to fulfill all their carbon-cutting promises by 2030 and stick to them all the way through the century—at a cost of more than $100 trillion in lost GDP—global temperature rise would be reduced by a tiny 0.3°F (0.17°C).

In a rush to do something—and be seen to be taking drastic action—more sensible approaches to counter global warming have been overlooked. Instead of simply mandating less carbon output, we need more R&D spending on green energy, including more efficient fission and fusion, cheaper solar and wind, and improved storage. New technology is crucial if green energy is to out-compete fossil fuels.

Policy makers who want to help the residents of the Marshall Islands today should look at improving the islands’ resilience and ability to cope with severe weather by improving infrastructure and storm preparedness. Tackling issues like poverty, health care, corruption and domestic violence would do even more. Those who seek to help should keep the bigger picture in mind.",low,"Biased, Flawed reasoning, Misleading",344,"This Wall Street Journal article comments on the fact that atoll islands in the Pacific are not all simply shrinking as sea level rises, because dynamic coastal processes can move sediment to build shorelines outward. However, the article doesn’t mention that sea level rise related to unchecked global warming would ultimately make many low-lying islands in the Pacific uninhabitable.

The author, Bjorn Lomborg, cherry-picks this specific piece of research and uses it in support of a broad argument against the value of climate policy. He also misrepresents the Paris Agreement to downplay its potential to curb future climate change.

","This article is misleading. The dynamics of shorelines of low-lying Pacific Islands are complicated and influenced by many local factors. Climate change and associated sea-level change are the underlying trend that will “win” over long time scales. There are many wiggles and local anomalies that, if taken out of context and analysed over short timescales, might hide the overall trend. This article is a textbook example of cherry-picking–jumping to false conclusions based on a small sample of data that does not reflect the bigger picture.

","There are a lot of claims that islands are passive geological entities that will sit there and drown. Our work shows that they are anything but static. They are dynamic. They move around and they can grow. So just because sea level is rising, it doesn’t mean doom and gloom for all atolls. Although the islands may survive into the future, the changes could still affect issues like fresh water and agriculture, potentially making life on these islands much more difficult than it is today.

",,,"Stephan Lewandowsky, Professor, University of Bristol:","This article is very interesting because it exemplifies a highly-misleading rhetorical practice that is effective, frequently used, but not easily recognized by the public–and hence all the more damaging. This is known as “paltering” and the term was popularized by Frederick Schauer and Richard Zeckhauser in 2009 and refers to “fudging, twisting, shading, bending, stretching, slanting, exaggerating, distorting, whitewashing, and selective reporting.” A successful palterer will try to avoid being untruthful in each of his/her utterances, but will nonetheless put together a highly misleading picture based on selective reporting, half-truths, and errors of omission. As the commenters have pointed out, this is the case here. Unfortunately, paltering is difficult for non-experts to detect and the best defense against it is to know who engages in it and for what political purpose.","Lauren Simkins, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia:","Land area gains due to sediment accretion in the Marshall Islands and other low-lying coastlines do not necessarily indicate that coastal populations are spared from the effects of sea-level rise. I find the presented argument that the focus should be on reducing poverty and political corruption in the Marshall Islands rather than on cutting global carbon emissions not well supported and misleading to a general audience.

","Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University:","The article contains a number of logical fallacies – red herring, false dichotomy – that seem to be recurrent in Lomborg’s articles. He does point out an interesting and perhaps little-known fact about current land dynamics of Pacific atoll islands; however, this fact, in and of itself, does not all of a sudden make current concern about global climate change overblown and irrelevant, as the article somehow implies. His presentation of the Paris Agreement and discussion of the best strategy to address global warming is, in my view, dishonest and misleading.

","Daniel Kammen, Professor, University of California, Berkeley:","In my view the author attempts to develop a polemic that funds spent on climate change are not benefiting the poor, and that there is, in fact, a choice between one and the other. This is demonstrably false, and yet the author repeats it despite the evidence.

","James Renwick, Professor, Victoria University of Wellington:","The effects of sea level rise on tropical Pacific islands are indeed complicated. Implying that climate change and sea level rise are therefore not urgent concerns is very misleading.

","Andreas Schmittner, Associate Professor, Oregon State University:","The article does not acknowledge the benefits of the Paris agreement.

","Emmanuel M Vincent, Research Scientist, University of California, Merced: Emmanuel Vincent, Research Scientist, Editor, Science Feedback
","The article contains very instructive examples of flawed reasoning.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain. This is not only true for the Marshall Islands. […]several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation [growth] and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century, resulting in a net increase in island area.”

","The dynamics of sand accretion and loss across the tropical Pacific is indeed complicated, and many atolls are at the moment growing. However, as sea levels rise in this area of the globe, water tables also rise and become salinated, reducing the availability of fresh water for drinking or agriculture. Focusing on the tropical Pacific takes attention away from regions where the signal is much clearer, e.g. the east coast of the USA. The occurrence of “nuisance flooding” and coastal inundation has risen dramatically in recent decades. Another 50-100 centimeters of sea level rise globally threatens vast swaths of built infrastructure and hundreds of millions of lives. Whether or not Pacific atolls accrete or shrink is not the most central issue.
","This statement is oversimplified and cannot be generalised. For example, there is evidence from the Solomon Islands that five islands have disappeared in recent years while six others have experienced severe shoreline recession*. This evidence is based on time series of aerial and satellite imagery from 1947 to 2014 of 33 islands, along with historical insight from local knowledge: “Shoreline recession at two sites has destroyed villages that have existed since at least 1935, leading to community relocations…”

Albert S et al (2016) Interactions between sea-level rise and wave exposure on reef island dynamics in the Solomon Islands Environmental Research Letters
","As wave energy and rising sea levels batter coastlines, the erosional products (i.e. sediments) can either be accreted onto the existing land or removed offshore into the deep ocean. Where the sediment is redistributed depends on a number of factors. Although sediment accretion can increase land area, it does little to change the elevation of low-lying islands, like the Marshall Islands. Therefore, people living in low-lying areas, even if there is historical land area gain, are still susceptible to inundation and damages due to storm waves, higher-than-usual tides (e.g. king tides), and sea level rise. These unconsolidated, loose sediments are also easily mobilized; therefore, localized land area gains by sediment accretion can be very dynamic on short timescales. This article could leave readers thinking that land area gains alone can mitigate the effects of sea level rise on low-lying coastal areas, but land elevation is what is really important.",,"“The most famous of these studies, published in 2010 by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji, showed that of 27 Pacific islands, 14% lost area. Yet 43% gained area, with the rest remaining stable.”

","This comment does provide a reasonable assessment of the message of our article: that the majority of islands have become larger or remained stable and that islands are locationally dynamic on their reef platforms. We think these dynamic features do pose management challenges for island communities. However, all reports fail to reflect the nuances of our work.

","What is for sure is that the island’s natural sedimentary systems will not just sit and be unresponsive. The islands will respond but we must be very careful to point out that ”response” does not necessarily mean that the islands will be maintained in the form we recognize today, that is, we do not know how long an island with soils for agriculture, complex vegetation, good fresh groundwater reserves, etc. can be maintained. Indeed, given what we understand of increasing rates of sea level rise we may be talking about relatively inhospitable gravel banks as the response to the next 100 years of sea level rise.",,,"“It seems self-evident that rising sea levels will reduce land area. However, there is a process of accretion, where coral broken up by the waves washes up on these low-lying islands as sand, counteracting the reduction in land mass. Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain.”

",It’s just plain wrong to assume that all atolls are washing away. It’s also wrong to sugar-coat the sobering facts that rising sea levels will ultimately seal the fate of low-lying islands and their limited soils and groundwater. The confusion isn’t surprising. It’s just more complicated than many expect.,,,,“suggest that residents are fleeing atolls swiftly sinking into the sea. Yet new research shows,Scientists’ comments on this article clearly show that it is also not an “entire” or “accurate” picture. So Mr. Lomborg is using the very flawed reasoning he is condemning others of.,,,,“Representatives from the Marshall Islands have been vocal about the need for strong global action on climate. President Hilda Heine has told reporters that longtime residents are leaving the Marshall Islands because climate change is threatening the nation’s existence,"Mr. Lomborg cherry-picks studies relative to the global average. (Indeed, some areas of the Canadian Maritimes and Greenland are expected to see sea-level fall, but overall the rise is significant and a huge danger to the poor).

The idea that aiding the poor was an alternate to addressing climate change was wrong 15 years ago when I last debated Mr. Lomborg and is wrong today. False dichotomies are a sad refuge from the facts of both poverty and climate change.

","This is an interesting rhetorical trick by Bjorn Lomborg. So far he has only supported the point that ‘as of today, the area of many Pacific islands have not decreased’. But this doesn’t mean that ‘the islands existence is not threatened’, notably in the future as sea level rise becomes more severe. So here, he is swapping a weak claim that he has supported for a much stronger one that he has not, a version of the red herring fallacy.",,,"“Those who seek to help should keep the bigger picture in mind.”

","Exactly Mr Lomborg. That’s why focusing on a small component of the story, in an area where many competing forces mask the underlying signal, is such a narrow approach. If one looks at the big picture of climate change, the loss of ice and snow, the increasing high temperature extremes, the already-apparent effects of sea level rise around the globe, the urgency of the problem becomes crystal-clear.
",,,,"“Policy makers who want to help the residents of the Marshall Islands today should look at improving the islands’ resilience”

","This is a classic technique in Lomborg’s articles: he focuses on one small aspect of climate change – here the Marshall Islands, other times maybe polar bears or heat-related human deaths – that i) he passes off as the main concern about global warming, and ii) that he can provide some seemingly contradictory information about… All the other consequences of global warming are conveniently set aside… Red herring.",,,,"“This will achieve almost nothing.

","Dr. Lomborg sets out to show that the INDCs [emission reduction pledges] are useless. To do so he grossly misrepresents the pledges. He constructs an incomplete accounting that omits the pledges of many nations, ignores China’s pledge to cap its emissions by 2030, and assumes that the [European Union countries] will abandon their commitment to emissions reductions as soon as their pledges are fulfilled. (find more details in this rebuttal of Lomborg’s paper)

","The last IPCC report makes it very clear that following a path of strong emissions reductions can indeed cap warming at 2C or less, while business as usual would see 4-5C of warming this century. It is also now clear that meeting the Paris targets will likely save the West Antarctic ice sheet from melting, while other scenarios would see many metres of sea level rise, effectively destroying many of the major cities of the world. The costs of such inaction are almost incalculable.

",,,"“At a cost of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion annually, the Paris climate agreement, recently ratified by China, is likely to be history’s most expensive treaty. It will slow the world’s economic growth to force a shift to inefficient green energy sources.”","Not sure how these costs are derived—references would be good. […] These treaty costs may appear unprecedented, but so are the risks posed by climate change. Climate change “costs” are hard to quantify precisely – for instance, how to give a monetary value to the loss of certain ecosystems?—but likely to be quite significant. This recent study in Nature, for instance, indicates that: “If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23% by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change”.

Burke et al (2015) Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production. Nature
","There are hundreds of corporations who have signed on to reducing emissions in their own best interest (e.g. Walmart, DuPont, Chevron, Johnson and Johnson, Mercedes Benz, Dow… consult the White House website for an expanded list), reducing emissions and helping their customers do the same, for the benefit of their bottom line and their employees and their shareholders.

These companies know that they will make money working to reduce their carbon emissions (being first to get there). Their gains are not recognized by Bjorn’s cost estimates. This is not to say that it is free. It is to say that Bjorn’s Holy Grail of cost-benefit analysis should include the enormous deductions to costs from the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Analysis of “James Lovelock: ‘Before the end of this century, robots will have taken over’”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/james-lovelock-interview-by-end-of-century-robots-will-have-taken-over-decca-aitkenhead-the-guardian/,"James Lovelock: ‘Before the end of this century, robots will have taken over’",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/30/james-lovelock-interview-by-end-of-century-robots-will-have-taken-over,"James Lovelock’s parting words last time we met were: “Enjoy life while you can. Because if you’re lucky, it’s going to be 20 years before it hits the fan.” It was early 2008, and the distinguished scientist was predicting imminent and irreversible global warming, which would soon make large parts of the planet uninhabitably hot or put them underwater. The fashionable hope that windfarms or recycling could prevent global famine and mass migration was, he assured me, a fantasy; it was too late for ethical consumption to save us. Before the end of this century, 80% of the world’s population would be wiped out.

His predictions were not easy to forget or dismiss. Sometimes described as a futurist, Lovelock has been Britain’s leading independent scientist for more than 50 years. His Gaia hypothesis, which contends that the earth is a single, self-regulating organism, is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science, and his invention of a device to detect CFCs helped identify the hole in the ozone layer. A defiant generalist in an era of increasingly specialised study, and a mischievous provocateur, Lovelock is regarded by many as a scientific genius.

Eight years after our previous encounter, he appears to have aged not one bit. At 97, he’s conceived a beautifully illustrated book of essays described as a “tool kit for the future”, The Earth and I, and written the introduction and conclusion; he goes walking every day, his hearing is perfect, his focus forensic and his memory unimpaired. “Yes, why not? I’m writing a fiction book at the moment. It’s tremendous fun, you know.” He applies his holistic philosophy of science to his own health. “I’m a firm believer that if you don’t use it, you lose it – and if you do a lot of walking, and if you use your muscles quite a bit, your brain seems to work as well. You’ve got to look at the whole system, not just bits of it.”

What has changed dramatically, however, is his position on climate change. He now says: “Anyone who tries to predict more than five to 10 years is a bit of an idiot, because so many things can change unexpectedly.” But isn’t that exactly what he did last time we met? “I know,” he grins teasingly. “But I’ve grown up a bit since then.”

Lovelock now believes that “CO2 is going up, but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would. The computer models just weren’t reliable. In fact,” he goes on breezily, “I’m not sure the whole thing isn’t crazy, this climate change. You’ve only got to look at Singapore. It’s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.”

There are various possible explanations for his change of heart. One is that Lovelock is right, and the models on which his former predictions were based were fatally flawed. Another is that his iconoclastic sensibility made revision irresistible. An incorrigible subversive, Lovelock was warning the world about climate change for decades before it began to pay attention, and just when the scientific consensus began to call for intervention to prevent it, he decided we were already too late. But there is a third explanation for why he has shifted his position again, and nowadays feels “laid back about climate change”. All things being equal – “and it’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board” – he expects that before the consequences of global warming can impact on us significantly, something else will have made our world unrecognisable, and threaten the human race.

Lovelock maintains that, unlike most environmentalists, he is a rigorous empiricist, but it is manifestly clear that he enjoys maddening the green movement. “Well, it’s a religion, really, you see. It’s totally unscientific.” He was once invited to Buckingham Palace, where he told Princess Anne: “Your brother nearly killed me.” Having read that Prince Charles had installed grass-burning boilers at Highgrove, Lovelock had tried one in his house. “It’s supposed to smoulder and keep the place warm; but it doesn’t, because it goes out, and clouds and clouds of smoke come out.” He giggles. “Princess Anne thought this was hilariously funny.”

Lovelock had been trying to heat his old mill in Devon, where he lived for more than 35 years, inventing contraptions in a workshop that resembled a Doctor Who set. He and his wife recently packed up his life’s work and downsized to a remote cottage on Chesil Beach in Dorset, after the bill to heat the mill for just six months hit £6,000. “I remember George Monbiot took me up on it and wrote that it was impossible, that I had to be lying. But I wasn’t lying, I’ve got the figures.” Monbiot doesn’t quite accuse him of lying, in fairness; just of “talking rubbish” and “making wild statements”. In any case, he says that in the US he found he could heat a house for six months, in temperatures of -20C (-4F), for just £60. As a result, he has withering contempt for environmentalists’ opposition to fracking. “You see, gas in America is incredibly cheap, because of fracking,” he says. But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes? He rolls his eyes.

“Sure enough, that’s true, there will be an increase. But they’re tiny little tremors, they would be imperceptible. The only trouble is that you can detect them. The curse of my life has been that I’ve spent a lot of time inventing devices that are exceedingly sensitive. And the moment somebody can detect something, they’re going to attach a number to it, and then they make a fuss about it.” He chuckles, then pauses. “I’m not anti-green in the sense that I’m in favour of polluting the world with every damn thing we make. I think we’ve got to be careful. But I’m afraid, human nature being what it is, the thing gets exaggerated out of all proportion, and the greens have behaved deplorably instead of being reasonably sensible.”

Even more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelock’s passionate support for nuclear power. But, like fracking, he says, it offers only “a stopgap” solution. “Because in the long term, they’ll use up all the uranium.” How long would that take? He pauses to do some quick mental arithmetic, as casually as I might tot up how many pints of milk to grab from Sainsburys.

“Let’s see … I think uranium that is affordable to extract would last about 50 years, something in that range. It might be 100. When you’ve used all that up, you go to thorium, and that would last you three times as long as uranium – so, shall we say, about 200 years?” The most sensible energy solution would be to cover 100 sq miles of the Sahara in solar panels. “It would supply the whole of Europe with all the energy they needed,” but it won’t happen “because it would be so easy for terrorists to go and bugger it up”. So for now, nuclear energy is the only viable option.

But all this, he clarifies cheerfully, is more or less academic. “Because quite soon – before we’ve reached the end of this century, even – I think that what people call robots will have taken over.” Robots will rule the world? “Well, yes. They’ll be in charge.” In charge of us? “Yes, if we’re still here. Whether they’ll have taken over peacefully or otherwise, I have no idea.”

He isn’t alone in this view: the influential philosopher Nick Bostrom has persuaded many people that artificial intelligence poses a real threat to the future of humanity; Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, among others, have called for urgent research to mitigate the risks. Still, when Lovelock outlines this vision, his tone is so matter-of-fact that for a moment I wonder if he’s joking. He isn’t. “We’re already happily letting computers design themselves. This has been going on for some time now, particularly with chips, and it’s not going to be long before that’s out of our hands, and we’ll be standing aside and saying, ‘Oh well, it’s doing a good job designing itself, let’s encourage it.’” Computers will develop independent volition and intuition (“To some extent, they already have”) and become capable of reproducing themselves, and of evolving. “Oh yes, that’s crucial. We’ll have a world where Darwin’s working.” Darwinism doesn’t work now? “Oh no, we’ve temporarily turned Darwinism backwards. I mean, we preserve the ones that would not have survived.”

He pauses, and adds quickly: “Don’t let’s get dangerous on this one. I don’t want this appearing in the Guardian that he just wants all the dumb and the lowlifes wiped out.”

Lovelock doesn’t sound the least bit troubled by the prospect of robots taking over, though, despite the possibility that they will destroy us. “Once they become at all established anywhere, that’s the end, because to robots time happens one million times faster – that’s a fairly exact figure – than it does to us. That’s rather wonderful in a way, isn’t it?”

I ask him to explain. “Well, for a neuron to travel a foot takes a microsecond – which is fairly fast. But for electrons to go down a foot of wire takes a nanosecond. It’s a million times faster, as simple as that. So to a robot, once fully established in that new world, a second is a million seconds. Everything is happening so fast that they have on earth a million times longer to live, to grow up, to evolve, than we do.”

It is possible, he goes on, that human beings may fuse with robots to become a blend of robotic and human tissue (“That’s one route”), but the likelier scenario will be pure robots. Why does he think we’ll go for all-out robots? He shoots me an amused look. “I don’t think we will. I think that they will – that’s the key thing here.”

The implications for climate change are obvious. “The world that they’re going to be comfortable in is wildly different from the one that we feel comfortable in. So once they really get established, they will – with regret – start losing organic life.” Will they care about rising temperatures? “They won’t give a fourpenny fuck about the temperature, because to them the change will be slow, and they can stand quite a big change without any fuss. They could accommodate infinitely greater change through climate change than we can, before things get tricky for them. It’s what the world can stand that is the important thing. They’re going to have a safe platform to live in, so they don’t want Gaia messed about too much.”

Notwithstanding his caveats about the dangers of predictions, his confidence in the robotic future he describes is “fairly high. Yes, all sorts of things can happen, but that’s the intuitive feeling I have”. As for our interaction with robots: “Well, it’s going to be very peculiar.” In the classic Frankenstein tradition, will humanity not understand what it has created until it’s too late? “Well, too late is the wrong word. Let’s say, until it has happened.” The phrase “too late”, he explains, implies regret – but whereas the robots might see no use for our continued existence, “maybe we’ve got some special property that they will appreciate. But then, don’t forget, their timescale is a million times different from ours. They’d have a lot of trouble talking to us.” In the same sense that we have trouble talking to ants? “Oh no, it’s much worse than that. It’s really more like us talking to a giant redwood tree. And you never know, they may feel about us the same way as we feel about trees.” They might even, I suggest, want to hug us? Lovelock’s face lights up in delight. “Yes, exactly! Exactly. That’s a good one.”

Lovelock was no less bafflingly cheerful when he believed climate change was about to wipe out 80% of the world’s population. How can he now feel just as sanguine about a global takeover by robots? “One may say: ‘Well, of course, he’s so old he’s stopped having any feelings.’ Not true, I’ll say!” He would have been, he insists, just the same 50 years ago. “And I would hate to think it was an affectation.” He would rather not be called a maverick, because it makes him sound like someone who “makes gadgets in his garage”.

“But everything in life to me is just: ‘Oh, isn’t that interesting?’”","low, very_low","Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",100,"The Guardian interviewed James Lovelock (who is promoting a new book) about his speculations on Earth’s future. While the article largely features Lovelock’s subjective opinions about the future, it also contains statements about climate science and climate change that reviewers find inaccurate and unsupported by current science.

The article does not inform the reader when Lovelock’s opinions and extraordinary claims are at odds with the conclusions of science that are based on a wealth of empirical data.

","It is hard to evaluate this article, as it’s an interview rather than any specific statement of fact by the author. However, the interviewee James Lovelock makes a number of misleading, unsupported, or outright incorrect statements about climate science which largely go unchallenged. While the article presumably faithfully reports Lovelock’s opinions, when those opinions are couched as scientific statements more pushback (or at least nuance) might be warranted.

",,,,"James Renwick, Professor, Victoria University of Wellington
","Some interesting ideas, but this is largely a flight of fancy, not grounded in the science of climate change.

","Aimée Slangen, Researcher, Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ)
","The quotes on climate change (e.g. sea-level rise, CO2 emissions) do not reflect the current state of the scientific literature at all.

","Ken Caldeira, Senior Scientist, Carnegie Institution for Science:","Jim Lovelock is a creative and original thinker who has had many great ideas and who has made many important contributions over his career. Creative people have great ideas by having many ideas and then filtering out the ideas that are not so great.  Many very creative people are better at the idea generation stage than the idea filtering stage.

The journalist did not balance Lovelock’s statements with a set of clear statements saying that the vast majority of informed climate scientists (as, for example, represented by the IPCC reports) have reached consensus on conclusions that are diametrically opposed to what Lovelock is saying, and that the IPCC scientists have backed up their statements with a wealth of empirical data, whereas Lovelock is largely opining without providing any substantive evidence to support his rather extraordinary claims.

Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence, and Lovelock has not even come up to the standards of providing what the scientific community would consider to be ordinary evidence.

","Lauren Simkins, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia:","Inaccuracies and a lack of reference to scientific findings result in an article that is purely opinion-based and extremely misleading.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"” ‘CO2 is going up, but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would. The computer models just weren’t reliable.’ ”
","This statement is just plain wrong. Atmospheric CO2 content has recently surpassed 400 ppm and this rate of increase is in line with model projections.

","This graph from the IPCC’s Summary For Policymakers shows that CO2 is actually at the medium to higher end of the projected changes:

Figure: Global mean surface temperature as a function of cumulative total global CO2 emissions from multi-model results for various emissions scenarios (coloured lines) and observations (black line).

","Lovelock seems rather confused on this point. CO2 has actually gone up a bit faster than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted back in the Fourth Assessment Report

But modeling CO2 concentrations isn’t really that complicated (at least in the short term), and not a big focus of the IPCC and climate modelers. Rather, they use a number of different future emission scenarios reflecting different paths society could take to estimate the future warming, sea level rise, precipitation changes, and other more complex emergent properties of the climate system. Lovelock seems to be mixing up CO2 concentrations with temperatures, but even temperatures have been well within the range projected by models.
",,"” ‘Anyone who tries to predict more than five to 10 years is a bit of an idiot, because so many things can change unexpectedly.’ ”

","Actually, scientists have a reasonably good track record at predicting changes to the Earth’s climate so far. For example, in 1981 NASA scientist James Hansen and colleagues predicted that continuing CO2 emissions would warm the earth 0.4 °C by 2010. In reality, 2010 temperatures were about 0.5 °C warmer than in the early 1980s. Similarly, our climate models generally do a good job of reproducing the range of temperature change (and variability) seen in observational data:

",,,,"” ‘and it’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board’ ”

","Volcanic eruptions do have a cooling effect, but the effect is temporary (the aerosol has a lifetime of about a year, with a recovery period of up to a decade), so you’d need a Pinatubo to go off every couple of years (which is not too likely to happen) and that would still not be enough to counteract the climate response to the increase in CO2 emissions.

There is a lot of literature looking at the effect of volcanic eruptions in climate models*, which shows the impact on sea-level rise, which is a small temporary sea-level fall, followed by a recovery over a decade or so.

Gleckler et al (2006) Krakatoa lives: The effect of volcanic eruptions on ocean heat content and thermal expansion, Geophysical Research Letters
Gregory (2010) Long‐term effect of volcanic forcing on ocean heat content, Geophysical Research Letters","Volcanoes have a sizable impact on the climate, but a relatively short-lived one. The impact of a large volcano like the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 will cool the climate for a few years, but after five years or so the system would revert to nearly the same state it would have been without the eruption*. It would take a supervolcano or a large period of extended volcanism to seriously disrupt our modeled scenarios, and these sort of events are relatively rare (the odds of them happening in the next 100 years are very small).

Some climate models do actually have volcanoes of various sizes stuck in randomly in the future (since we can’t really predict future volcanism apart from assuming it occurs at roughly the same rate as we’ve experienced in the past), but the inclusion of these don’t really change the expected warming or other climate impacts in the next century.

Hansen et al (1996) A Pinatubo Climate Modeling Investigation
 

","This is completely untrue. In terms of CO2 emissions, all the volcanic eruptions in the world combined put less than 1% of human CO2 emissions into the atmosphere every year. A large volcanic eruption in the tropics can cool the climate significantly for a couple of years (such as Mt Pinatubo in 1991) but climate models capture this extremely well.",,"“Even more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelock’s passionate support for nuclear power.”

","Here Lovelock is less heretical than he thinks; most future energy scenarios that meet aggressive climate goals show an expansion of nuclear energy, particularly in countries like China. There is something of an open question whether Nuclear will remain cost-competitive with other near-zero carbon technologies, however, given how quickly the costs of these technologies have fallen:

",,,,"” ‘Let’s see … I think uranium that is affordable to extract would last about 50 years, something in that range. It might be 100. When you’ve used all that up, you go to thorium, and that would last you three times as long as uranium—so, shall we say, about 200 years?’ ”

","It is true that conventional uranium resources are insufficient to power civilization for the long-term. However, innovative approaches are making uranium extraction from seawater look increasingly attractive economically. Cost-effective uranium extraction from seawater could power civilization for a very long time. That said, the Sun will also last a very long time, so solar power also makes a lot of sense, especially if we could develop good energy storage or global-scale electricity grids that could wheel power to the night side of the Earth.",,,,"” ‘You see, gas in America is incredibly cheap, because of fracking,’ he says. But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes? He rolls his eyes.”

","Lovelock is correct that hydraulic fracturing has played a large role in driving down U.S. natural gas prices. He also states a reasonable position that some of the opposition to “fracking” has been based on scientifically-dubious claims. That said, there are certainly best practices that the industry could apply to minimize drinking water contamination as well as seismic activity (which is primarily associated with wastewater disposal wells rather than fracturing per se).

Where fracking gets more complicated is in its climate impact. While we are very likely better off if we are replacing coal with gas, it’s hard to make the case that a large buildup of gas infrastructure is consistent with meeting our aggressive climate goals, at least in developed countries like the United States. For more details, see this recent Yale Climate Connections article.

","There is a big misconception about the trigger of recent earthquakes in Oklahoma. Fracking in the United States has been used for several decades. However, the disposal of waste water into the subsurface has been directly linked to the recent earthquakes in Oklahoma. A quick google scholar search on “Oklahoma earthquakes” will bring up numerous articles that demonstrate this point. My family has lived in Oklahoma for decades and I can tell you first-hand that the increase in number of >3.0 magnitude earthquakes is unprecedented in the past 8 years.",,,"” ‘You’ve only got to look at Singapore. It’s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.’ ”

","There is a study by Cannaby and colleagues from the UK Met Office on sea-level rise around Singapore*. They talk about vulnerable regions within 2 m of the sea level, and find a ‘worst-case’ sea-level rise of 0.74 ± 0.29 m by 2100, so I’d say this statement is not correct.

Cannaby et al (2016) Projected sea level rise and changes in extreme storm surge and wave events during the 21st century in the region of Singapore, Ocean Science
","I am not sure I understand Lovelock’s point about Singapore. Singapore is a relatively wealthy, urbanized country, with an economy that is not highly weather dependent. One would expect Singapore to be able to adapt to temperature changes with far greater ease than would a poor agrarian economy. Also, several studies have projected massive increases in sea-level as a consequence of climate change. Most of Singapore is within 15 meters of sea-level. Thus, if CO2 emissions continue, we can expect most of Singapore to be underwater within a few centuries.

",Desirability of a location has nothing to do with how safe it is from the effects of climate change.,,"“His Gaia hypothesis, which contends that the earth is a single, self-regulating organism, is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science […]”

","This is going a bit far. The Gaia gave many scientists food for thought, and a new way of thinking about the climate system in a holistic way, but it is hardly the “founding principle” of most climate science. That remains the physics of fluid flow and heat transport, plus chemistry and biology, etc.

","Climate science is based on physical, biological, and chemical processes. There are feedbacks between these processes such as biological consumption of atmospheric CO2 by photosynthesis. However, the idea of a self-regulated Earth system due to biological activity is not a common principle of climate science.",,,"“Before the end of this century, 80% of the world’s population would be wiped out.”

","The late Stephen Schneider, one of the giants of modern climate science, once said that in his opinion “the ‘end of the world’ and ‘good for you’ are the two lowest probability outcomes” when discussing climate change. Lovelock seems to be swapping from one extreme largely unsupported by the bulk of existing scientific evidence to the opposite. In reality, our best evidence suggests that unmitigated climate change would be very detrimental to society (and the natural world), but that we can address it through difficult concerted action. The worst potential outcomes of climate change occur in scenarios where CO2 triples relative to pre-industrial levels, and while we still have a long way to go, the actions that countries around the world committed to in Paris will help avoid some of the most disastrous outcomes.",,,,"” ‘Well, [the green movement is] a religion, really, you see. It’s totally unscientific.’ ”

","The ability of greenhouse gases to trap heat in the atmosphere, the fact that loss of ice decreases how much energy is reflected from Earth’s surface back to space, and ocean acidification due to uptake of CO2 into the ocean are all scientifically explained by chemical and physical processes. I am sure there are different definitions of “the green movement”, but any action that “the green movement” can advocate for reduced greenhouse gas emissions has the potential to alter the physical, chemical, and biological processes that cause warming.

The latest Democratic Party platform compares the fight against global warming to World War II.

Using terms such as ""battlefield,"" ""siege,"" and ""front,"" those opposed this ""war effort"" have been labeled anything from Nazis to Holocaust deniers. (I personally have been called a sociopath by climate activist Joe Romm of the Center for American Progress, another story.)

The upcoming election has inspired dire concern. Don’t “vote for climate catastrophe” warned a Washington Post editorialist. “At this point,” stated Michael Klare, Professor of Peace and World Security at Hampshire College, “electing green-minded leaders, stopping climate deniers (or ignorers) from capturing high office, and opposing fossil -fueled ultranationalism is the only realistic path to a habitable planet.”

Desperation Backfire?

Equating the Third Reich with the free society’s fossil-fuel reliance, and charging Republicans with climate destruction, is from the theater of the absurd. Americans care greatly about the future; to say otherwise is to deny their very humanity. It is right and fair that critics of climate catastrophism reject calls for bigger government, tax-wise and regulation-wise.

And the great middle can be excused for realizing that obsessing about climate change is avoiding a frank discussion about the here-and-now problems of budget deficits, the federal debt, school choice, entitlement reform, and so on.

Perhaps there is good news in the ugliness of desperate activists who are trying to get their issue out front. Not only do polls suggest the public is unmoved at home and in abroad, serial exaggeration at this point is arguably backfiring, confirming the perils of climate exaggeration.

Until civility returns, our side can ask whether the critics are acting like the Gestapo of global warming. Two can play a game that should not be played at all.

No Point of No Return

Global warming activists tout their commitment to evidence and reason. Yet their dismal track record seems to lead to only more drama and hyperbole, not humility and open-mindedness.

Back in 2006, Al Gore prophesied that unless the world dramatically reduced greenhouse gasses, we would hit a ""point of no return."" And in his book review of Gore’s book and movie from that year, An Inconvenient Truth, scientist James Hansen unequivocally stated: “We have at most ten years—not ten years to decide upon action, but ten years to alter fundamentally the trajectory of global greenhouse emissions.”

Time is up on Gore’s “point of no return” and Hansen’s “critical tipping point.” But the two fathers of the global-warming movement (Hansen and Gore got it going back in the summer of 1988) have nary admitted their exaggeration nor set a new timetable for effective action.

Many others have followed the same scare-and-hide pattern. Rajendra Pachauri, while head of a United Nations climate panel, pleaded that without drastic action before 2012, it would be too late to save the planet.

Back in the late 1980s, the UN claimed that if global warming were not checked by 2000, rising sea levels would wash entire counties away. Four years ago, Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge, predicted “global disaster” from the demise of Arctic sea ice—in four years. He too, is eating crow.

There is some levity in all this charade. In 2009, then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown predicted that the world had only 50 days to save the planet from global warming. But fifty days and years later, and the earth still spins.

 

Science Diminished

Falsified and sure-to-be-falsified exaggerations from a parade of Ph.D. scientists are ruining the reputation of science itself. Physical science has turned into profit-maximizing political science. As Judith Curry explained to Congress:

In their efforts to promote their “cause,” the scientific establishment behind the global warming issue has been drawn into the trap of seriously understating the uncertainties associated with the climate problem. This behavior risks destroying science’s reputation for honesty. It is this objectivity and honesty which gives science a privileged seat at the table. Without this objectivity and honesty, scientists become regarded as another lobbyist group.

Can climate research get back on track? Can the “uncertainty monster” in climate research, and particularly climate modeling, be acknowledged? Can such study overcome the Malthusian bias (change is bad; mankind is at fault) to achieve impartiality? Can the federal role in climate research be scaled back to improve incentives and quality?

Optimism, Anyone?

There is good news as good science drives out bad. The discrepancy between model-predicted warming and (lower) real-world observations has inspired new respect for natural climate variability relative to greenhouse-gas forcing.

“Although some researchers doubted the existence of a global warming hiatus because of coverage bias, artificial inconsistency, and a change point analysis of instrumental Ts records,” a just-published study at Nature.com’s Scientific Reports found, “it is now accepted that a recent warming deceleration can be clearly observed.”

Sensitivity estimates—defined as the temperature effect from the enhanced greenhouse effect—have been coming down in the peer-reviewed literature, even to the point when climate economists see a positive externality, not a negative one, from the human influence on climate. (In technical lingo, the so-called social cost of carbon would be negative.)

Such new thinking, long overdue, would shift the mainstream to a new view of the beneficence of plentiful, affordable, reliable energy. Depletion, security, and pollution fears quieted, natural gas, coal, and oil can be seen in a white light.

“Fossil fuels don’t take a clean environment and make it dirty,” noted Alex Epstein, ""they take a dirty environment and make it clean.” Fossil fuels, he adds, “don’t take a safe climate and make it dangerous, they take a dangerous climate and make it safe.”

The real news is good news in contradiction to doom-and-gloom. It is time for energy and climate planners to lay down their government arms. Let consumers and taxpayers be.

The author fails to grasp this point when he asserts that the worst impacts of climate change should have already occurred if they were realistic.

The net economic costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time. However, attempts to measure climate change economic impacts at the global scale is highly dependent on economists’ assumptions and there are a hosts of climate change impacts that cannot be accounted for by consumption-based global aggregations of economic impacts (e.g. impacts on ecosystems, more pronounced impact on developing countries…).

(more details and explanations)

Natural variability has been studied by science since the beginning. That El Niño fluctuations can give the appearance of a “hiatus” is something scientists have warned about since the likes of Robert Bradley Jr. have started their “hiatus” meme, ignoring all those warnings. Without any need for statistical expertise, this can be seen in the plot below from the Texas State Climatologist.

","This graph of global temperature helps to put the “slowdown” of warming that occurred around the 2000-2010 period in perspective. It is misleading to put the emphasis on the slowdown without reminding that, over the long term, the temperature keeps rising.

As the Scientific American article points out, the authors of the study cited by the author were confident in reporting their findings—which do not refute the existence of anthropogenic global warming—because science exists to challenge previous work and is constantly incorporating new information that may alter previous conclusions, a fact which undercuts the author’s claims repeated throughout his article that climate science is a politically-motivated house of cards.",,"“Back in the late 1980s, the UN claimed that if global warming were not checked by 2000, rising sea levels would wash entire counties away.”

Observations are already showing that the accelerating loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is giving indications of committing the world to a few meters (roughly 5-10 feet) of rise in global sea level over the next few centuries, which would seriously disrupt many coastal cities and swamp a number of island nations—and there is no indication that actions to reduce emissions can reverse this commitment—so, we are indeed moving past the point where emissions cutbacks can keep sea level and climatic conditions near to the conditions that have allowed civilization to flourish over the past several centuries

",,,,"“Sensitivity estimates—defined as the temperature effect from the enhanced greenhouse effect—have been coming down in the peer-reviewed literature…”

","This statement is somewhat misleading. Estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity have been coming down in one branch of the literature that uses global energy budget observations (e.g. Otto et al 2013). However, recent work suggests that those energy budget estimates are biased low, moving estimates back up again once those biases are corrected for (see my recent commentary*). Meanwhile, estimates of sensitivity from other methods (e.g., paleoclimate, process-based observational constraints or climate model simulations) haven’t budged. Altogether, I don’t see any reason that the IPCC range isn’t still our best guess.

Kyle C. Armour (2016) Projection and prediction: Climate sensitivity on the rise, Nature Climate Change
",,,,"“climate economists see a positive externality, not a negative one, from the human influence on climate. (In technical lingo, the so-called social cost of carbon would be negative.)”

","This is cherry-picking at its worst. You can always find an economist who will make enough assumptions so that he or she can give you the answer you want. In this case (references the social cost of carbon), you can get a benefit ONLY if you assume a very high discount rate (like 5% so that future generations do not matter), and you ignore equity issues, and you assume that warmer climates in the crop-intensive areas will not include an increase in the intensity and/or frequency of intense weather (drought, floods, etc….), and you do not recognize that warmer temperatures mean more pests and more weeds.

see the Summary for Policymakers of the Report of Working Group II to the fourth assessment of the IPCC

","The social cost of carbon would indeed be negative for a low climate sensitivity. This is because the net impacts of climate change only turn negative at more pronounced warming, and this would occur in a more distant future for a low climate sensitivity. At the same time, the positive impacts of carbon dioxide fertilization would be unaffected.

","The present calculations of the “social cost of carbon” tend to be bottom up and so include only those costs that one can reasonably quantify. As a result many types of impacts are simply left out of the calculation, like the cost of losing the culture of an island nation that is swamped, the impacts of ocean acidification and biodiversity loss, the actual social cost of climate change (e.g., of the New England climate becoming that of the Southeast, Sweden like Spain, etc.)…

","At a minimum, the author should be honest and say that “some climate economists” conclude that the net externalities of climate change may be positive, as the article he links to discusses only the economic views of its author and anecdotes from two climate scientists. Further, the article the author links to discusses only the net economic impacts on “the US and most of the developed countries”, while climate change will impact economies around the globe. This is not a meaningful argument anyway, as the exact value of the climate sensitivity does not inherently determine whether climate impacts will be economically net positive or negative.

","“Falsified and sure-to-be-falsified exaggerations from a parade of Ph.D. scientists”

",The author does not provide any evidence of “falsified” scientific reports of climate predictions or observations.,,,,"“Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge, predicted ‘global disaster’ from the demise of Arctic sea ice—in four years. He too, is eating crow.”

","These predictions of Peter Wadhams have been opposed by all climate scientists I know of. This picking of quotes that are convenient for Robert Bradley Jr.’s narrative while ignoring what most climate scientists say is one of his most used rhetorical tools.

","Indeed. Wadham’s claims have been roundly refuted by the climate science community. They are certainly an example of exaggeration, but to suggest that they somehow represent the scientific mainstream is a great distortion.

[See Climate Feedback review of the latest prediction by P. Wadhams]",,,"“Can the “uncertainty monster” in climate research, and particularly climate modeling, be acknowledged?”

","A quick look through the IPCC assessment reports reveals long discussions about uncertainty in our understanding and climate prediction. Moreover, uncertainty in global warming projection exists mainly at the high end—toward more warming—for simple physical reasons.

","The scientific community has been scrupulously careful to report uncertainties in terms of “likely” or “confidence”. The planet has warmed; that is unequivocal. Humans have contributed; that is more than 95% assured.
See: IPCC 5th Assessment Report

",The “uncertainty monster” is a reason to act faster. Uncertainties about how strongly the climate will respond makes the risks of climate change larger.,,"“…obsessing about climate change is avoiding a frank discussion about the here-and-now problems of budget deficits, the federal debt, school choice, entitlement reform, and so on.”

","Of course, this is a classic false dilemma used by climate change contrarians, which claims that you can’t deal with climate change AND other issues simultaneously. This is patently wrong.",,,,“Not only do polls suggest the public is unmoved at home and in abroad…”,"This claim is incorrect. The source given to support “the public is unmoved at home” is an article titled “Poll: 91% Of Americans Aren’t Worried About Global Warming.” However, this article reports that “only 9.2 percent of Americans rank global warming as their biggest concern.” Not ranking global warming as your biggest concern is not the same thing as not being concerned at all. According to a 2016 Gallup survey, 64% of Americans are “worried a ‘great deal’ or ‘fair amount'” about global warming:

"Analysis of “Greenland’s huge annual ice loss is even worse than thought”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/greenlands-huge-annual-ice-loss-is-even-worse-than-thought-damian-carrington-the-guardian/,Greenland’s huge annual ice loss is even worse than thought,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/greenlands-huge-annual-ice-loss-is-even-worse-than-thought,"The huge annual losses of ice from the Greenland cap are even worse than thought, according to new research which also shows that the melt is not a short-term blip but a long-term trend.

The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities.

The new study reveals a more accurate estimate of the ice loss by taking better account of the gradual rise of the entire Greenland landmass. When the ice cap was at its peak 20,000 years ago, its great weight depressed the hot, viscous rocks in the underlying mantle. As ice has been shed since, the island has slowly rebounded upwards.

Previous satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account, but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought, up to 12mm a year. This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year, an increase of about 8% on earlier figures.

The faster rebound is thought to be the result of hotter, more elastic mantle rocks under eastern Greenland, a remnant from 40m years ago when the island passed over the hot spot that now powers Iceland’s volcanoes.

The new work was also able to reconstruct the ice loss from Greenland over millennia and found that the same parts of Greenland - the north-west and south-east - were where most ice is being lost both in the past and today.

This means the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.

“The fact that we are seeing such a similarity of past and present behaviour suggests we could lose ice in these regions for decades into the future,” said Prof Jonathan Bamber, at the University of Bristol, UK, and one of the international team of scientists who carried out the new study, published in Science Advances.

Bamber said the presence of a long-term trend does not mean global warming is not a crucial factor: “One thing we can be certain of is that a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean is only going to accelerate this trend.”

“The headlines of climate change and melting polar ice are not going to change,” said Dr Christopher Harig, at the University of Arizona, who was not involved in the study. “The new research happening now really speaks to the question: ‘How fast or how much ice can or will melt by the end of the century?’ As we understand more the complexity of the ice sheets, these estimates have tended to go up. In my mind, the time for urgency about climate change [action] really arrived years ago, and it’s past time our policy reflected that urgency.”

Dr Pippa Whitehouse, at the University of Durham and also not involved in the new research, said: “This study highlights the powerful insight that GPS measurements can give into past and present ice loss. Using such measurements, this study demonstrates that some of the highest rates of ice loss across Greenland - both in the past and at present - are found in areas where the ice sheet flows directly into the ocean, making it dangerously susceptible to future warming in both the atmosphere and the ocean.”

The team behind the new research said better estimates of continental rebound rates could be even more significant in estimates of ice loss from the world’s biggest ice cap, in Antarctica, but that sparse data from the remote continent made analysis difficult.

In April, very high temperatures led to a record-breaking early onset of glacier melting in Greenland, while another satellite study in August reaffirmed the rapid loss of ice.",very_high,"Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning, Unbiased",84,"Damian Carrington’s article in the Guardian is an accurate summary of a new study advancing estimates of ice lost from Greenland. One of the factors that must be accounted for when monitoring the size of the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica is the vertical motion of the land beneath the ice due to geological forces. The Earth’s crust is depressed under the weight of a growing ice sheet, and will rebound upwards as the ice sheet shrinks. Carrington’s article describes a new study finding greater “crustal rebound” in Greenland, which means some methods of estimating the loss of Greenland ice will have underestimated that loss.
The reviewers pointed out that, while this work is important, it doesn’t constitute as much of a breakthrough as is suggested in the article, but mostly confirms that the rate of Greenland ice melt is now 3 times what it was before the industrial revolution.

","While I would have preferred a slight moderation of the headline (replace ‘worse’ with e.g. ‘greater’ or ‘larger’) I find the headline accurate and supported by the article. The article explains the novelty and impact of the research accurately for the general readership and in particular the context provided from the scientists works really well in this regard.

",,,,"Martin Truffer, Professor, University of Alaska Fairbanks:","The article might not explain the relevance of this work all that well, but there is really nothing controversial being presented here. The Science article presents some important new measurements, but there is no fundamental difference to what we understand about how the icesheet works.

","Twila Moon, Research Scientist, University of Colorado, Boulder:",A well-written article that accurately discusses the scientific study and the current state of Greenland research,"Allen Pope, Research Associate, National Snow and Ice Data Center, University of Colorado Boulder:","The article does a good job of accurately portraying and providing insight to the science. A clearer focus on the different timescales involved might have improved it, but it is very good.
","Lauren Simkins, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia:","Carrington’s article is a succinct and accurate assessment of past and present ice mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet that is supplemented by insightful comments from scientific experts.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.”

","While this paragraph is not imprecise, there is a slight wiggle room for the wrong interpretation that the acceleration of ice loss seen in the past decades is just a “blip” on top of a much larger rate of mass loss since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This new work finds the contribution to sea level rise from the Greenland Ice Sheet since the LGM to be 4.6 ± 0.7 m – an average ice loss rate of roughly 75-80 Gt/yr, which is almost identical to the rate of ice loss in the 20th century (75 Gt/yr) suggested by Kjeldsen et al. (2015). The rate of ice loss has accelerated in the past decades so that we today see rates that are more than the triple of those earlier rates. However, I do not think this is a major issue, as the paragraph is sandwiched in between precise explanations and context provided by scientists.

","Yes, there are two processes going on here: 1) changes still happening in the solid Earth from the last ice age and 2) current changes to the Greenland ice sheet. The former is impacting our ability to measure the latter.

",,,"“Previous satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account, but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought, up to 12mm a year. This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year, an increase of about 8% on earlier figures.”

","When scientists use modern data from e.g. satellite gravity measurements to estimate present-day ice loss, we need to correct for land uplift. Because the satellite sees that mass is changing below, but it cannot tell what is due to land motions and what is due to ice loss. The huge Sumatra earthquake caused huge land displacements and changed the gravity field. But for Greenland, changes in gravity are both due to land displacements and ice mass “displacements” or “ice loss”. This new paper solves the problem by using direct GPS measurements of land displacements.

","It’s a nice study, but the 20GT/yr represents less than 10% of the observed signal and is well within the uncertainty of those measurements (263+/-30 Gt/year – 2005-2010 loss from Shepherd et al, 2012).
Moreover, it’s not clear how well sparsely sampled points constrain their estimates, so there is some uncertainty on the 20Gt/yr (it could be more or less).
So while we are always striving to improve measurements of ice sheet mass loss, and this is a step in the right direction, it doesn’t produce any fundamental change in the current estimates of rates of loss from the Greenland ice sheet.

",It might be worth noting that only some satellite estimates need to take this into account. Especially gravity-based mass change recoveries will be impacted while elevation-change or input/output methods will not. Projects like IMBIE intercompare different methods to build consensus among them.,,"“The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities.”
","To expand on this statement, observations of ice mass loss indicate that the Greenland Ice Sheet contributes 0.33 [0.25-0.41] mm/yr to global sea level rise. Contributions from thermal expansion and glaciers outside of Antarctica and Greenland are currently the major contributors to global sea level rise followed by contributions from the Greenland Ice Sheet.
While it is important to recognize the potential sea level equivalents held up in current ice sheets, complete loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet by 2100 is not reasonable and would likely take thousands of years.
For a paleo-perspective, Greenland ice cores and ice sheet models demonstrate that parts (now which parts are up for debate) of the Greenland Ice Sheet did collapse during the last interglacial period (~125,000 years ago) when global mean atmospheric temperature was ~1 degrees C warmer than pre-industrial temperature; however, sectors of the ice sheet remained intact.

","This number [six meters] is quoted in virtually every article published about Greenland (in media and science literature!). It’s really an irrelevant number, and without any context can be very misleading, as it is here. The total loss of the Greenland ice sheet may not happen under any reasonable future scenario, and in any case would take many thousands of years to occur. A more meaningful number would be the current estimate of what the net loss might be by 2100; this could then be given as a percentage of the total ice volume on Greenland, but for the purposes of an article like this, where the reader is thinking about human consequences, quoting the total ice volume will only confuse the issue.",,,"“Ice cap is disappearing far more rapidly than previously estimated, and is part of a long-term trend, new research shows”

","Again, “ice sheet” is more accurate than “ice cap”. In general, the term “ice cap” is not used in scientific literature. As a result, I think its use is confusing in the media, too, as people have a hard time understanding if it refers to ice sheets (thick ice on land) or sea ice (which are very different!).

"Analysis of “Flooding of Coast, Caused by Global Warming, Has Already Begun”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/flooding-of-coast-caused-by-global-warming-has-already-begun-justin-gillis-the-new-york-times/,"Flooding of Coast, Caused by Global Warming, Has Already Begun",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/science/flooding-of-coast-caused-by-global-warming-has-already-begun.html,"NORFOLK, Va. — Huge vertical rulers are sprouting beside low spots in the streets here, so people can judge if the tidal floods that increasingly inundate their roads are too deep to drive through.

Five hundred miles down the Atlantic Coast, the only road to Tybee Island, Ga., is disappearing beneath the sea several times a year, cutting the town off from the mainland.

And another 500 miles on, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., increased tidal flooding is forcing the city to spend millions fixing battered roads and drains — and, at times, to send out giant vacuum trucks to suck saltwater off the streets.

For decades, as the global warming created by human emissions caused land ice to melt and ocean water to expand, scientists warned that the accelerating rise of the sea would eventually imperil the United States’ coastline.

Now, those warnings are no longer theoretical: The inundation of the coast has begun. The sea has crept up to the point that a high tide and a brisk wind are all it takes to send water pouring into streets and homes.

Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called “sunny-day flooding” — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years. The sea is now so near the brim in many places that they believe the problem is likely to worsen quickly. Shifts in the Pacific Ocean mean that the West Coast, partly spared over the past two decades, may be hit hard, too.

These tidal floods are often just a foot or two deep, but they can stop traffic, swamp basements, damage cars, kill lawns and forests, and poison wells with salt. Moreover, the high seas interfere with the drainage of storm water.

In coastal regions, that compounds the damage from the increasingly heavy rains plaguing the country, like those that recently caused extensive flooding in Louisiana. Scientists say these rains are also a consequence of human greenhouse emissions.

“Once impacts become noticeable, they’re going to be upon you quickly,” said William V. Sweet, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Silver Spring, Md., who is among the leaders in research on coastal inundation. “It’s not a hundred years off — it’s now.”

Local governments, under pressure from annoyed citizens, are beginning to act. Elections are being won on promises to invest money to protect against flooding. Miami Beach is leading the way, increasing local fees to finance a $400 million plan that includes raising streets, installing pumps and elevating sea walls.

In many of the worst-hit cities, mayors of both parties are sounding an alarm.

“I’m a Republican, but I also realize, by any objective analysis, the sea level is rising,” said Jason Buelterman, the mayor of tiny Tybee Island, one of the first Georgia communities to adopt a detailed climate plan.

But the local leaders say they cannot tackle this problem alone. They are pleading with state and federal governments for guidance and help, including billions to pay for flood walls, pumps and road improvements that would buy them time.

Yet Congress has largely ignored these pleas, and has even tried to block plans by the military to head off future problems at the numerous bases imperiled by a rising sea. A Republican congressman from Colorado, Ken Buck, recently called one military proposal part of a “radical climate change agenda.”

The gridlock in Washington means the United States lacks not only a broad national policy on sea-level rise, it has something close to the opposite: The federal government spends billions of taxpayer dollars in ways that add to the risks, by subsidizing local governments and homeowners who build in imperiled locations along the coast.

As the problem worsens, experts are warning that national security is on the line. Naval bases, in particular, are threatened; they can hardly be moved away from the ocean, yet much of their land is at risk of disappearing within this century.

“It’s as if the country was being attacked along every border, simultaneously,” said Andrea Dutton, a climate scientist at the University of Florida and one of the world’s leading experts on rising seas. “It’s a slow, gradual attack, but it threatens the safety and security of the United States.”

‘We’re Living It’
One night eight years ago, Karen Speights, a Norfolk resident, was sitting at the dinner table with her mother, eating crab legs dipped in butter and a tangy sauce. She felt a tingle.

“Ma!” she cried. “My feet are wet!”

Her mother laughed, but then she felt it, too: a house that had not flooded since the family moved there in 1964 was soon awash in saltwater. Ms. Speights initially hoped that flood was a fluke. Instead, it turned out to be the first of three to hit their home in less than a decade.

Nowadays, Ms. Speights, an administrative worker at a utility company, is wondering how to get her and her mother out of the neighborhood before the water comes again, without taking too much of a financial hit. And she pays more attention to problems that once seemed remote, like warnings from scientists about the rising sea.

“I believe it because we’re living it,” Ms. Speights said as she sat on her sofa, nodding toward the nearby tidal marsh that sent water into her living room. “The water has to be rising if we never flooded, and all of a sudden we’ve flooded three times in eight years.”

Because the land is sinking as the ocean rises, Norfolk and the metropolitan region surrounding it, known as Hampton Roads, are among the worst-hit parts of the United States. That local factor means, in essence, that the region is a few decades ahead in feeling the effects of sea-level rise, and illustrates what people along the rest of the American coast can expect.

The biggest problems involve frequent flooding of homes and roads. As the sea rises, hundreds of tidal creeks and marshes that thread through the region are bringing saltwater to people’s doorsteps.

This summer, on a driving tour of Norfolk and nearby towns, William A. Stiles Jr. pointed to the telltale signs that the ocean is gradually invading the region.

He spotted crusts of dried salt in the streets, and salt-loving marsh grasses that are taking over suburban yards. He pointed out trees killed by seawater. He stood next to one of the road signs that Norfolk has been forced to install in recent years, essentially huge vertical rulers so people know the depth of floodwaters at low-lying intersections.

“There’s just more and more visible impacts: water on the street, water that won’t clear from the ditch, these intense rain events, higher tides,” Mr. Stiles said.

“It’s beginning to catch the attention of citizens, restaurant owners, business people, politicians. There’s just much more of a conversation, and it’s not just in the politically safe places. It’s everywhere.”

Mr. Stiles, known as Skip, heads a local environmental group, Wetlands Watch. At his suggestion, students at two local universities began looking at the neighborhood where Ms. Speights lives, Chesterfield Heights. It has had little history of flooding, but that is starting to change as the water rises.

The plan the students developed has morphed into an ambitious program to safeguard the neighborhood, and another nearby, for decades. The Obama administration recently gave Virginia more than $100 million to carry the plan out. The administration has also enlisted one of the universities, Old Dominion in Norfolk, to spearhead a broad effort at better planning.

But the size of that grant illustrates the scope of the problem confronting the region, and the country: protecting a single neighborhood from rising water can easily cost tens of millions of dollars. Sea walls and streets may have to be raised, or movable gates built along waterways so they can be closed at times of high water.

While the Obama administration is trying to create a few showcase neighborhoods, there is no sign Congress is prepared to spend the money that cities and states say they need: tens of billions of dollars just to catch up to the current flooding problems, much less get ahead of them. Norfolk alone, a town of 250,000 people, has a wish list of $1.2 billion — or about $5,000 for every man, woman and child in the city.

As the national response lags, experts warn that the flooding is putting the country’s defense at risk.

Several studies have concluded that Naval Station Norfolk, the world’s largest naval base, is profoundly threatened by rising seas, as are other coastal bases. The Pentagon has managed to build floodgates and other protective measures at some facilities. But attempts by the military to develop broader climate change plans have met fierce resistance in Congress.

That was the case this summer, when an effort by the Pentagon to appoint officers to take charge of climate resilience led to a House vote prohibiting taxpayer money from being spent on the plan.

“When we distract our military with a radical climate change agenda, we detract from their main purpose of defending America from enemies” like the Islamic State, said Mr. Buck of Colorado, the Republican congressman who sponsored the measure. His amendment passed the House 216 to 205, though the Senate has yet to agree to it.

Many people in Congress, almost all of them Republicans, express doubt about climate science, with some of them promulgating conspiracy theories claiming that researchers have invented the issue to justify greater governmental control over people’s lives. So far, this ideological position has been immune to the rising evidence of harm from human-induced climate change.

The Obama administration has been pushing federal agencies, including the Pentagon, to take more aggressive steps. But without action in Congress, experts say these efforts fall far short of what is required.

“In the country, certainly in the Congress, it hasn’t really resonated — the billions and perhaps trillions of dollars that we would need to spend if we want to live on the coast like we’re living today,” said David W. Titley, a retired rear admiral who was the chief oceanographer of the Navy, and now heads a climate center at Pennsylvania State University.

“I haven’t seen any evidence that there is serious thought about this: What does a world of three, four, five feet of sea-level rise look like?”

Mounting Evidence
Deep in a thicket of trees on an out-of-the-way island in the Florida Keys, a diesel engine roared to life. Soon a drill bit was chewing through ancient limestone, pulling up evidence from the geological past that might shed light on the future of the planet.

On a sultry day in March, Dr. Dutton, the University of Florida scientist, stood watch over the drilling operation, inspecting her samples as they emerged from the ground. She spotted fossilized corals, proof that what is now the dry ground of Lignumvitae Key was once underwater.

With taxpayer funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Dutton is chasing what might be the most urgent question in climate science: How fast is the ocean going to rise?

“Is it going to happen in decades, or centuries, or a thousand years?” Dr. Dutton asked as she took a break to eat lunch on a tarpaulin spread under the trees. “This will give us an example to say, ‘Well, the last time this happened, here is how long it took.’”

The opponents of climate science in Congress, and the tiny group of climate researchers allied with them, have argued that the concerns of thousands of mainstream scientists about the future are based on unproven computer forecasts.

In reality, their concerns are based in large part on mounting evidence of what has happened in the past.

Through decades of research, it has become clear that human civilization, roughly 6,000 years old, developed during an unusually stable period for global sea levels. But over longer spans, coastlines have been much more dynamic.

During ice ages, caused by wobbles in the Earth’s orbit, sea levels dropped more than 400 feet as ice piled up on land. But during periods slightly warmer than today, the sea may have risen 70 or more feet above the current level.

Dr. Dutton and other leading scientists are focused on the last sea-level high point, which occurred between the last two ice ages, about 125,000 years ago.

After years of surveying ancient shorelines around the world, scientists determined that the sea level rose by something like 20 to 30 feet in that era, compared with today. But how long did it take to make that jump? That is the question Dr. Dutton, using improved research techniques, wants to answer.

Large parts of the Florida Keys are simply ancient coral reefs that grew during the period of high seas, and were exposed when the levels fell. Trees, roads and houses now sit atop the old reefs. By recovering samples, Dr. Dutton hopes to date a sequence of corals as they grew along with the rising sea, potentially revealing the rate at which the water rose.

The research, likely to take years, may supply a figure for how quickly the ocean was able to rise under past conditions, but not necessarily a maximum rate for the coming decades. The release of greenhouse gases from human activity is causing the planet to warm rapidly, perhaps faster than at any other time in the Earth’s history. The ice sheets in both Greenland and West Antarctica are beginning to melt into the sea at an accelerating pace.

Scientists had long hoped that any disintegration of the ice sheets would take thousands of years, but recent research suggests the breakup of West Antarctica could occur much faster. In the worst-case scenario, this research suggests, the rate of sea-level rise could reach a foot per decade by the 22nd century, about 10 times faster than today.

In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible. A rise that large over a span of decades would be an unparalleled national catastrophe, driving millions of people from their homes and most likely requiring the abandonment of entire cities.

In essence, by revealing how sensitive the ice sheets have been to past warming, Dr. Dutton’s research may answer the question of whether such a rapid jump is possible.

Along those parts of the United States coast that are sinking at a brisk clip, including southern Louisiana and the entire Chesapeake Bay region, including Norfolk, the situation will be worse than average. On the Pacific Coast, a climate pattern that had pushed billions of gallons of water toward Asia is now ending, so that in coming decades the sea is likely to rise quickly off states like Oregon and California.

Along the East Coast, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say that many communities have already, or will soon, pass a threshold where sunny-day flooding starts to happen much more often.

“When you look at the historical record, there’s no trend saying the flooding is going down,” said Dr. Sweet, the NOAA expert. “The trends are all very clear. They’re going up, and they’re going up in many of these areas in an accelerating fashion.”

Late last year, in Paris, nations reached a landmark global agreement to cut emissions. It is fragile, and might not survive if Donald J. Trump is elected president in November; he has pledged to scrap it.

But the air is already so full of greenhouse gases that most land ice on the planet has started to melt. So even if the deal survives, it will, at best, slow the rise of the sea and perhaps limit the ultimate increase. Many climate scientists, including Dr. Dutton, believe a rise of at least 15 or 20 feet has already become inevitable, over an unknown period.

Facing Hard Decisions
As Brad Tuckman walked the piece of land in Fort Lauderdale where he is building a grand new house, he pointed toward the canal that wraps around three sides of the property.

It is scenic, with yachts plying the water, yet as the sea has risen, street flooding in the area has become a recurring nuisance. So before starting construction, Mr. Tuckman said he spent nearly a half-million dollars to raise the sea wall and truck in dirt to elevate the land.

“The predictions of what’s going to happen over the next 20, 30, 40 years — it’s real,” said Mr. Tuckman, the founder of a company offering creative services to the retail industry.

In South Florida, among the worst-hit parts of the country for sunny-day flooding, people are not waiting for state or federal help. Those who can afford it are starting to act on their own. A company, Coastal Risk Consulting, has cropped up to advise them, and is offering its services nationally.

Cities and counties in the region have formed an alliance and enlisted professors to help them figure out what to do. They are hiring “chief resilience officers,” an idea pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, which is paying some of the salary cost.

In Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale, as well as in older Northern cities like Boston and New York, tidal marshes and creeks were filled in a century or more ago to make new land, and it is in these areas — “back bays,” as some of these spots are called — where the flooding is happening first.

That is because they remain the lowest spots in the landscape, vulnerable to the rising water nearby. Old drain pipes empty into the tidal creeks, and at high tide the water can back up through these pipes, bubbling into the streets seemingly from nowhere.

In Miami Beach, the city engineer, Bruce A. Mowry, has come up with a plan for combating the flooding. He rips up problematic streets, raises them with extra dirt and repaves them, installing new drains and giant pumps that can push water back into the bay. The approach has already been shown to work in several neighborhoods.

A controversy has erupted about whether Miami Beach is polluting Biscayne Bay with the water, but the city is pushing ahead. Miami Beach plans to spend at least $400 million on its plan by 2018, raising the money through fees imposed on homes and businesses.

The huge county government for the region, Miami-Dade County, is developing its own resilience strategy, one likely to cost billions. It has committed to rebuilding some of its decaying infrastructure, like a sewage plant, in a way that safeguards against sea-level rise and storm surges.

“I don’t see doom and gloom here; I see opportunity,” said Harvey Ruvin, the clerk of courts for Miami-Dade County, who has been a leading voice on the environment in Florida for a half-century, and who recently led a county task force on sea-level rise. “We’re talking about the most robust possible jobs program you can think of, and one that can’t be outsourced.”

Many of the Republican mayors in the region are on the same page as Democrats in requesting national and state action on climate change, as well as pushing local steps. James C. Cason, the Republican mayor of Coral Gables, has convened informational sessions that draw hundreds of residents, and he has received no complaints for his stance.

“I hope in coming years when we have to spend a lot of money, the citizens will still support it,” Mr. Cason said in an interview.

Still, his city, and others in South Florida, have some hard decisions to make.

Some property owners cannot afford to raise their sea walls, putting their neighborhoods at increased risk of flooding. Will they be held legally responsible when floods do occur? A strict policy could force some people from their homes. Conversely, should public money be spent to do the work, even if it largely benefits private property?

Just for streets, storm drains and the like, South Florida governments will need to raise billions, and they have yet to figure out how. Moreover, if the rise of the sea accelerates as much as some scientists fear, it is doubtful the cities will be able to keep up.

The region has one mayor, Philip K. Stoddard of South Miami, who is a scientist himself — he studies animal communication at Florida International University — and has been a close reader of scientific papers about climate change since the 1990s.

“I remember lying in bed at night thinking, ‘I hope this isn’t real,’” Dr. Stoddard, a Democrat, recalled. “I hope other data comes in that contradicts it. It took me several years to get my head around it and say, ‘Oh, God, it is real.’”

Now he is focused on easing the pain for South Miami, with a $50 million system of sewer pipes to replace septic tanks threatened by the rising water table.

“You can play it really badly and let unpleasant things happen earlier,” he said. “Or you can push them off by doing some infrastructure repairs and some thoughtful planning.”

He is, though, under no illusions about the long-term fate of the region he calls home.

“We’re putting enough heat in the ocean to send water over us, no question,” Dr. Stoddard said. “Ultimately, we give up and we leave. That’s how the story ends.”",very_high,"Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",616,"Writing for the New York Times, Justin Gillis links the issue of global sea level rise due to climate change to examples of “sunny-day flooding” at high tide along the US East Coast.

The 12 scientists who reviewed the article found that it accurately described sea level data and research. Global sea level has risen about 20 centimeters (8 inches) over the past century, contributing to an observed increase in coastal flooding. However, multiple factors affect flooding in coastal communities and many locations along the US East Coast have experienced an even larger sea level change due to additional local factors.

The article also discusses research into future sea level rise based on records of past climate changes. While climate scientists generally think that sea level rise will not be greater than 1-2 meters (3.3-6.6 feet) this century, previous warm periods indicate that greater long-term sea level rise should follow in coming centuries—but precisely how much, and how quickly, is not well known. Around 125,000 years ago, for example, the Earth was probably about 1-2°C warmer than it is today, but global sea level may have been 6 meters (20 feet) higher.

","I find this a compelling piece of journalism translating our emerging scientific understanding into an accessible and credible form. It brings home to readers that sea-level rise impacts are being experienced today on the US Atlantic coast. The theory of sea-level rise and flood problems is pretty well understood — this makes the point that this theory is also happening now and can only be expected to get worse — sea levels have been rising on the US east coast for the last 150 years or more and even if current trends simply continue, impacts will continue to grow. As the article states, we actually expect a significant acceleration of sea-level rise in the coming decades meaning the impacts will grow more rapidly. The discussion of the public policy aspects of the issue is also important and shows that we need to start adapting to these changes now — they are only going to get worse.

","This article is well-researched and demonstrates an understanding of the nuances related to the rates of sea-level rise, and how it varies in time and space. This article does a good job at conveying the state of the science and including supporting anecdotal information regarding the inundation of the coastal U.S. due to sea-level rise.","Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University:","The parts of this article that report on climate science are accurate. In my view, the only thing is that issue of short-term (by 2100) vs long-term (next few centuries) sea level rise projections could perhaps have been explained a bit more clearly: even though total sea level rise by the end of the century is quite uncertain, a sustained 2°C warming almost certainly guarantees a 6 meters sea level rise over the next several centuries.

","Aimée Slangen, Researcher, Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ):","As far as I can judge, the article is scientifically sound and refers to up-to-date literature, interviewing knowledgeable scientists in the field. I would have liked to see a bit more nuance around the ‘melt’ of land ice though.

","Lauren Simkins, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia:","This article supports local perspectives on sea-level rise in the United States with accurate, yet qualitative, scientific observations.

","Mike MacCracken, Chief Scientist for Climate Change Programs, Climate Institute:","While there is no real discussion in this article about other factors affecting the coastline (e.g., land subsidence and emergence, local projects that affect movement of sand, the digging of trenches through coastal wetlands, etc.), the contribution resulting from global climate change affecting sea level rise is increasingly dominating the contributions of other factors in most locations.

That the present rise of a bit less than a foot since the 19th century is already having so much influence should help to justify the significance and concern in the scientific and defense communities and increasingly in some communities and states regarding the projected additional rise in sea level of two feet and possibly double that over the 21st century. The real uncertainty is becoming not how much the rise will be in the year 2100, but that the world is becoming committed to an ongoing rate of rise of a few to several feet per century, and that what is uncertain is exactly when that much rise will occur rather than if it will occur.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called ‘sunny-day flooding’ — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years. The sea is now so near the brim in many places that they believe the problem is likely to worsen quickly.”

","This refers to the historical analysis of “nuisance” tidal flooding frequencies (days per year) which we assessed in Sweet et al. (2014).  In this report we looked at all tide gauges with hourly data since 1980 and with a threshold for “minor” impacts.

When minor flooding (nuisance) is expected, the Weather Forecasting Offices (WFO) typically issues a “coastal flood advisory”; they issue a coastal flood warning when levels are expected to reach moderate or major levels.  The minor thresholds I started calling “nuisance levels” and the phrase caught on.  Generally nuisance levels vary from 1-2 feet around the U.S.

The National Weather Service has a website (AHPS) that includes some of the tide gauge thresholds along with river gauges.

Sweet et al (2014) Sea Level Rise and Nuisance Flood Frequency Changes around the United States, NOAA Technical Report
",This is accurate. Global sea levels have risen by about 20 cm due to human induced global warming in the last 100 years. Both US coasts have experienced this. It is true that subsidence on the east coast has exacerbated this and the last 20 years of natural variations on the west coast may have given folks a false sense of security because it has opposed or hidden the global rise experienced almost everywhere else.,,,"“Along the East Coast, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say that many communities have already, or will soon, pass a threshold where sunny-day flooding starts to happen much more often.“

","This relates to the Sweet and Park (2014) paper that uses a 30 days/year threshold as a definition of a tipping point. Though the 30 days/year threshold is somewhat arbitrary, it is sufficiently high that once a region experiences this many floodings, the conversation of what to do to address sea level rise tidal flooding has likely forefront.

The “soon” part refers to the fact that number of flooding days per year has (East and Gulf Coast locations) and will continue to accelerate with steady (linear) rises in sea level.

Sweet and Park (2014) Acceleration and tipping points of coastal inundation from sea level rise",,,,"“These tidal floods are often just a foot or two deep, but they can stop traffic, swamp basements, damage cars, kill lawns and forests, and poison wells with salt.”","The depth of flooding is accurate as stated, as shown in Fig. 2 of Sweet and Park (2014)",,,,"“Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called ‘sunny-day flooding’ — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years.”

","This is a tricky one. Nuisance flooding on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts is the result of relative sea-level rise. Relative sea-level rise has a variety of components that give the rise a spatial signature. For example along the mid US Atlantic coast one-third of the rise is due to glacial isostatic adjustment with the remainder dominated by climatically driven sea-level rise. But in the Mississippi Delta the dominant driving force is subsidence. However, in the coming century these components will decrease in importance relative to climatically driven sea-level rise.",,,,"“Because the land is sinking as the ocean rises, Norfolk and the metropolitan region surrounding it, known as Hampton Roads, are among the worst-hit parts of the United States.”

","This statement about the land sinking in the region of Norfolk, leading to higher rates of sea level rise is correct, and is supported by plenty of research, including: Kopp et al. (2014 Probabilistic 21st and 22nd century sea-level projections at a global network of tide-gauge sites, Earth’s Future)",,,,"“On the Pacific Coast, a climate pattern that had pushed billions of gallons of water toward Asia is now ending, so that in coming decades the sea is likely to rise quickly off states like Oregon and California.”

","This statement is likely to be accurate. Several papers already demonstrated the influence of decadal ENSO (El Niño) variations (or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation; PDO) onto the large-scale decadal sea-level variations in the Pacific Ocean (e.g. Zhang and Church 2012). Bromirski et al. (2011) specifically addressed the influence of decadal PDO/ENSO onto the west coast of America and demonstrated an influence of the PDO there, with a suppression of sea-level rise from the 80’s until 2005. As the decadal ENSO/PDO phase is reversing, there is over the past five years an accelerated sea-level rise over the west coast of America (Hamlington et al. 2016) that should continue in the next decade.

Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans.",,,,"“In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible.”

","Yes, I couldn’t agree more. I actually wrote a paper regarding a survey of sea-level scientists. The concluding statement was that most experts estimate a larger sea-level rise by AD 2100 than the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report AR5 projects:

Horton, Rahmstorf, Engelhart, and Kemp (2014) Expert assessment of sea-level rise by AD 2100 and AD 2300. Quaternary Science Reviews

","In the 2013 IPCC report, there is a reference period (1986-2005),  there is an assumption of a reference pathway of future emissions, and there is a confidence assigned to the estimate.  That being said, I think the statement is pretty good.  The second sentence is I believe accurate; the work by DeConto and Pollard, building on Pollard et al. (note that I’m involved in this study), for example, points to the possibility of rapid warming triggering rapid sea-level rise.

","This is a correct statement, but a key word is ‘some of them’.

There have been some people, notably Jim Hansen, who, as I understand it, have been proposing high rates of sea-level rise without providing a mechanism for these sea-level rise rates that seemed plausible to most glaciologists. It is my understanding that the mechanisms proposed by DeConto and Pollard (i.e., mechanical instability of ice cliffs) does appear to be plausible and has some support in observations of ice shelf break-up that has already occurred in Antarctica. In other words, if this sentence were written a year ago, “some of them” would have referred to a few scientists who hold what might be considered ‘outlier’ views. Following the work of DeConto, Pollard, and others, my sense is that the risk of very high rates of sea-level rise seems substantially higher, even to what might be considered ‘mainstream’ scientists.",,"“But the air is already so full of greenhouse gases that most land ice on the planet has started to melt.”

","Not sure how I would parse “most of the land ice has started to melt”.  It is true that there is net mass loss from most mountain glaciers, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and the West Antarctic ice sheet, which numerically makes most of the land ice. But, much of the ice remains too cold to melt, the big central region of East Antarctica is not melting, and much of the sea-level rise from the Antarctic is from faster flow into the ocean (after which the ice does melt…) rather than from melting in place.

","I think this is not a very accurate statement and should be nuanced. Rather than ‘melt’, one should talk about ‘mass loss’ (or ‘mass gain’), as melt is not the only process adding to sea-level change. Especially on Antarctica, ice discharge [ice sliding into the ocean] plays a much more important role than melt, as over large parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (i.e. inland East Antarctica) the temperatures are so low that surface melt, even in summer, is not an issue at present (see eg these maps of Antarctica surface melt area).

If we step away from the ‘melt’ however, […] most glaciers on Earth are suffering from mass loss (IPCC AR5 Chapter 4: “Since AR4 (in 2007), almost all glaciers worldwide have continued to shrink as revealed by the time series of measured changes in glacier length, area, volume and mass”). […]",,,"“In the worst-case scenario, this research suggests, the rate of sea-level rise could reach a foot per decade by the 22nd century, about 10 times faster than today.”

","We published the results of a study in Science Advances last year (Winkelmann et al., 2015; Combustion of available fossil fuel resources sufficient to eliminate the Antarctic Ice Sheet) concluding that in a worst case scenario, sea level could be rising at an average rate of a foot per decade, averaged over the next 1000 years. Our model, however, did not include the mechanical instability of ice sheet cliffs considered by DeConto and Pollard (2016; Contribution of Antarctica to past and future sea-level rise), which could potentially result in sea-level rises of this magnitude. A key word here is ‘could’. More work needs to be done to assess the likelihood of this occurrence, but sea-level rise rates of a foot per decade by year 2100 appear to be a real risk posed by our greenhouse gas emissions.",,,,"“During ice ages, caused by wobbles in the Earth’s orbit, sea levels dropped more than 400 feet as ice piled up on land. But during periods slightly warmer than today, the sea may have risen 70 or more feet above the current level.

the last sea-level high point, … occurred between the last two ice ages, about 125,000 years ago. … scientists determined that the sea level rose by something like 20 to 30 feet in that era, compared with today. “","This part would perhaps be a little bit clearer for readers if it included estimates of global temperature change during these different times, to associate with these numbers on sea level change.

The last ice age, at its coldest, is estimated to have been on the order of 5 degrees Celsius cooler, in terms of global average, than today. As the article mentions, sea levels then were ~400 feet lower. The last interglacial preceding it, which Dr. Dutton’s research focuses on, was perhaps 1-2C warmer than today (today meaning the pre-industrial climate, before the warming of the recent decades). As the article indicates, sea-levels were perhaps ~6 meters higher at the time.

Citing these numbers would help put into perspective, for readers, the projected man-made warming of a few degrees Celsius globally, and explain why the long-term expectations of many scientists … are that sea levels will ultimately rise, over centuries, by “at least 15 or 20 feet” if the globe warms by several degrees in a sustained manner. The questions remains of course, how fast that will occur. Uncertainties on possible rates of sea level rise explain why sea level numbers by 2100 are so uncertain; but what’s virtually certain is that sea level will continue rising beyond that.",,,,"“Through decades of research, it has become clear that human civilization, roughly 6,000 years old, developed during an unusually stable period for global sea levels.”

","The last 6,000 years have been unusually stable for the period of time that we are able to constrain rates of sea-level change particularly well (at sub-millennial timescales): see, for example, Lambeck et al (2014) Sea level and global ice volumes from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene.

"Analysis of “Next year or the year after, the Arctic will be free of ice”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/arctic-will-be-ice-free-in-summer-next-year-robin-mckie-peter-wadhams-the-guardian/,"Next year or the year after, the Arctic will be free of ice",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/21/arctic-will-be-ice-free-in-summer-next-year,"Peter Wadhams has spent his career in the Arctic, making more than 50 trips there, some in submarines under the polar ice. He is credited with being one of the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink. He was director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge from 1987 to 1992 and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge since 2001. His book, A Farewell to Ice, tells the story of his unravelling of this alarming trend and describes what the consequences for our planet will be if Arctic ice continues to disappear at its current rate.

You have said on several occasions that summer Arctic sea ice would disappear by the middle of this decade. It hasn’t. Are you being alarmist?
No. There is a clear trend down to zero for summer cover. However, each year chance events can give a boost to ice cover or take some away. The overall trend is a very strong downward one, however. Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic’s summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free. You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship. There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies along the Northwest Passage and along bits of the Canadian coastline. Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018.

Why should we be concerned about an Arctic that is free of ice in summer?
People tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change. Things happen, they say. In fact, the impact will be profound and will effect the whole planet and its population. One key effect will be albedo feedback. Sea ice reflects about 50% of the solar radiation it receives back into space. By contrast, water reflects less than 10%. So if you replace ice with water, which is darker, much more solar heat will be absorbed by the ocean and the planet will heat up even more rapidly than it is doing at present.

Sea ice also acts as an air-conditioning system. Winds coming over the sea to land masses such as Siberia and Greenland will no longer be cooled as they pass over ice and these places will be heated even further. These effects could add 50% to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions.

What will be the effects of this accelerating increase in temperatures?
The air over Greenland will get warmer and more and more of its ice will melt. It is already losing about 300 cubic kilometres of ice a year. Antarctica is adding to the melt as well. Sea-level rises will accelerate as a result. The most recent prediction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that seas will rise by 60 to 90 centimetres this century. I think a rise of one to two metres is far more likely. Indeed, it is probably the best we can hope for.

That may not sound a lot but it is really very serious. It will increase enormously the frequency of storm surges all over the world. We may be able to raise the Thames barrier in Britain but in Bangladesh, it just means more and more people will be drowned.

Global warming is generally associated with increased fossil-fuel burning and consequent rises in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. But is that the only climate problem we face?
No it is not. We also have the issue of methane. Russian scientists who have investigated waters off their coast have detected more and more plumes of methane bubbling up from the seabed. The reason this is happening is closely connected with the warming of the planet and the shrinking of the Arctic icecaps.

Until around 2005, even in summer, you still had sea ice near the coast. Then it started to disappear, so that for three or four months a year warm water reached the shallow waters around the shores where there had been permafrost ground since the last ice age. It has started to melt with dangerous consequences. Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates. When the permafrost goes, you release the pressure on top of these hydrates and the methane comes out of solution.

Can we monitor this methane just as we can monitor carbon dioxide?
Yes, we can measure methane over large areas using satellites. These have shown that methane levels that had been fairly flat for most of the last century have started to rise and are accelerating, often with little outliers on the graph. There is a scientist called Jason Box who works in Denmark for the Greenland Survey and he calls these outliers dragon’s breath. They are not some sort of measurement caused by dodgy instruments. They are real pulses of methane coming from offshore flumes.

How intense is methane as a heater of the atmosphere compared with carbon dioxide?
It is 23 times more powerful. However, methane dissipates much more quickly than carbon dioxide. It gets oxidised so that it only lingers in the atmosphere for about seven or eight years. By contrast, carbon dioxide hangs around in the climate system for about 100 years before it ends up in the sea and is absorbed by creatures that die and litter the seabed. At least that is what scientists thought. Today, there are quite a number of researchers who think carbon dioxide could last 1,000 years in the atmosphere.

So in the long run carbon dioxide is still going to be worse than methane in terms of heating the planet because a single methane pulse will have a disastrous effect but if there is nothing to follow it on then it will go away. But with carbon dioxide there is a ratchet effect. All the carbon dioxide we release by burning fossil fuels just builds up in the atmosphere. We are having to live with last century’s carbon dioxide. What that says is simple: there is no such thing as a safe emission rate of carbon dioxide. That is why I am despondent about us ever being able to cut carbon emissions.

If we cannot halt the emissions of carbon dioxide, what can we do?
In the end, the only hope we have is to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere once it has got there. Even the IPCC has admitted that we will have to find a way to extract carbon dioxide from the air. The trouble is that they don’t just how we can do that. The most favoured scheme is known as BECCS: bio-energy with carbon capture and storage. Essentially, you plant trees and bushes over vast swaths of ground. These grow, absorbing carbon dioxide in the process. Then you burn the wood to run power plants while trapping, liquefying and storing the carbon dioxide that is released.

It sounds straightforward. Will it work?
I am a bit suspicious of this technology. BECCS will need so much land to be effective. Calculations suggest it would need 40% to 50% of the arable land of the planet to make it work on the scale we will need and that would not leave enough land to grow crops to feed the world or to provide homes for a viable population of wild animals and plants. Other techniques, such as crushing and spreading olivine rocks, which absorb carbon dioxide, on beaches, will simply not scale up. They won’t work, so we will have to find some other way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere directly.

As far as I can see, it will have to take the form of some sort of device into which you pump air at one end and you get air without carbon dioxide coming out the other end. It can be done, I am sure, but at the moment we do not have such a device. However, without something like that I cannot see how we are going to deal with the carbon dioxide that is getting into the atmosphere. We are going to have to rely on a technology that has not yet been developed. That is a measure of the troubles that lie ahead for us. I think humanity can do it, but I would feel much better if I saw governments investing in such technology.",low,"Alarmist, Misleading",576,"The Guardian published an interview with Peter Wadhams, who discusses the consequences of human-induced global warming on Arctic climate and opines that “Next year or the year after, the Arctic will be free of ice”. This claim appears not to be supported by proper scientific argumentation based on evidence and a physical understanding of how that forecast would realize, either in the article or in previously published scientific papers.

The scientists who have reviewed the article indicate that while some statements are science-based, several claims are inaccurate or are opinions unsupported by current science. Most of the scientists tagged the article as ‘alarmist’ (meaning that “it overstates or exaggerates the risks of climate change”) and most indicated that the title of the article is not properly supported by its content. Widely publicizing this kind of guess, which has a low probability of turning out to be true, risks undermining public trust in science.
","The article contains numerous statements that are not supported by the scientific literature, but instead appear to be the personal opinion of Professor Wadhams. It is difficult to provide any meaningful rating for such an interview piece — Wadhams has the right to share his opinions when asked (however unsupported they may be) and at times even makes it clear that his statements are far outside the scientific mainstream. But I give the article low marks overall since it makes no attempt to distinguish which statements are rooted in science and which are simply speculation.

","Peter Wadhams’ views are well known to lie far outside the scientific mainstream. He makes several statements that are inaccurate and some are alarmist. There is no balance in the article from a more mainstream scientist.

",,,"Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University:","The interview/article should make it clearer that the claim by Prof Wadhams that the Arctic sea ice will be gone this year or next is at odds with mainstream climate science on that topic, and that he has repeatedly made such predictions that haven’t been borne out by subsequent observations. One could argue that climate model projections regarding Arctic sea ice are dire enough that there is no need to repeatedly provide unsubstantiated “guesstimates” of imminent collapse, and that doing so might even detract the public from the slower, but all too real, steady decline in sea ice, or even worse, that it eventually decreases the public’s trust in climate scientists.

","Allen Pope, Research Associate, National Snow and Ice Data Center, University of Colorado Boulder
","I gave the “low” rating because the article’s discussion of expected Arctic sea ice retreat is misleading and inaccurate. The statements are not solidly based on the most up to date science.

","Lauren Simkins, Assistant Professor, University of Virginia:Laurens Bouwer, Senior risk advisor, Deltares:","While the basic topics mentioned in the article are important to address, some of the statements are misleading and alarmist and the article is more of an opinion piece than a science-supported point.

","Rasmus Benestad, Senior scientist, The Norwegian Meteorological institute:","The question concerning sea ice is tricky due to the many and complex factors involved, and the lack of good ice models that embody all scales involved.

","Patrick Grenier, Specialist in climate scenarios, Ouranos","This interview article covers and links several issues (sea ice projections, seabed methane bubbling, carbon capture, etc.), and I agree with some of the messages. The central claim, as conveyed by the title, is that disappearance of the summer Arctic sea ice cover will occur either in 2017 or in 2018.

This is not what most sea ice experts consider. Before propagating a marginal view, one should ensure having a very strong argumentation; in this interview no argumentation is put forward to support Peter Wadhams’ central claim. The journalist has chosen to interview a researcher known for having made wrong predictions in the past, and he has chosen not to balance Wadham’s view against that of other sea ice experts. Wadhams’ alarmism is potentially harmful, because when such spectacular predictions are not realized some people may perceive the whole scientific community or science itself as untrustworthy.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018.”

","Readers should be reminded that under a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions scenario, climate models project an “ice-free” (less than 1 million km2 of ice) Arctic in September by ~2050. Peter Wadhams claims almost every year that it will happen sooner than that, in a matter of a few years – implying some total collapse of Arctic sea ice. This hasn’t happened so far, even if Arctic sea ice is decreasing a bit more rapidly than most models predict. I am borrowing this telling graph from Ed Hawkins (more details in this post):

","There is no reason to believe that the sea ice cover will disappear this quickly. Our best estimate for this comes from climate models projections, which show that the Arctic could become ice free (less than a million square km) by mid-century — at the earliest — under business-as-usual emissions. Observations show that sea ice is declining somewhat faster than models predict, but even accounting for this suggests that an ice-free Arctic is decades away.

","It is not clear whether a permanent or a one-year phenomenon is meant here (probably the former), but in any case the scientific support for the claim is weak.

In the former case (permanent disappearance), this would not correspond to what most sea ice experts do consider. Indeed, section 11.3.4.1 of the last (2013) IPCC assessment report suggests a very low probability for permanent disappearance within the current decade. In fact, from the scientific literature it seems the phenomenon is more likely to take place during the period 2040-2060. Of course, a very low probability does not necessarily mean a zero probability, and IPCC’s report could possibly underestimate the odds for disappearance within the next few years. But before propagating a marginal view (relative to IPCC conclusions), one should ensure having a very strong argumentation; in this interview no argumentation is put forward to support Peter Wadhams’ central claim.
In the other possible case (isolated single-year disappearance), it has to be said sea ice has strong year-to-year variability superimposed on its long-term declining trend, and no one has the tools to precisely predict the outcome one year in advance. Seasonal-to-decadal prediction groups equipped with physically-based models have some potential prediction skill for lead times up to 12-24 months, but they currently cannot guarantee to be right for any specific forecast (e.g.: Seasonal Forecasts of the Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Extent Using a GCM-Based Seasonal Prediction System and Pan-Arctic and Regional Sea Ice Predictability: Initialization Month Dependence). So, if it turns out in 2017 or 2018 that Wadhams was right, it will have been luck more than justified certainty.",,"“Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free. You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship. There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies”

","Professor Wadhams has been making this type of prediction in the media for several years, but they have not been borne out by the subsequent observations. For example: Telegraph, 2011 – “ice free by 2015”; Guardian, 2012 – “ice free by 2015 or 2016”; Financial Times, 2013 – “ice free no later than 2015”.

",I would also add that predictions of an ice-free Arctic (also defined as ~1 million square kilometers of remaining ice) are shown to be subject to quite a bit of uncertainty stemming from natural variability – on the order of about two decades.,,,“Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic’s summer sea-ice cover.”,This is incorrect. The SIPN team (Sea Ice Prediction Network) have collected forecasts from 40 international groups and none are predicting a record low in 2016.,,,,"“People tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change.”
","This is a good point. Changes in one part of the Earth system due to warming are not in isolation and result in feedbacks in other parts of the Earth system.

",,,,"“One key effect will be albedo feedback”

","Albedo is one effect, but it is moderated by cloud cover and only is effective during summer (winter gives dark “polar nights”). Other – perhaps equally important – factors involve the effect open sea has on exchange of moisture, the way temperature varies with height, cloud cover …

",,,,"“These effects could add 50% to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions.”

","The sea-ice albedo feedback is thought to contribute about 10% to global warming (it’s the smallest of the various climate feedbacks); that’s including the impact of Antarctic sea-ice loss as well. So this estimate of 50% for Arctic sea-ice loss alone seems far too high.

","These effects are admittedly included in climate models projections (even though sea ice disappears later in these models than Wadhams suggests here). What Wadhams is describing here is useful to understand these projections, but it doesn’t mean that these effects will come on top of current projections.

",,,"“Russian scientists who have investigated waters off their coast have detected more and more plumes of methane bubbling up from the seabed.”

","However, there is evidence from a dedicated field campaign that the methane in ocean plumes does not affect the atmosphere: Extensive release of methane from Arctic seabed west of Svalbard during summer 2014 does not influence the atmosphere",,,,"“Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates. When the permafrost goes, you release the pressure on top of these hydrates and the methane comes out of solution”

","It’s unclear what is meant by ‘permafrost goes’. Nothing particularly ‘goes’ anywhere, it just melts (and has been naturally melting due to post-Last Glacial Maximum sea level rise and the resulting thermal flux due to shelf inundation). Consequentially, I would not expect the pressure seen by the underlying hydrates to decrease if the overlying permafrost degrades. In fact in the real world it will probably increase due to anthropogenic sea level rise. So it will necessarily be an anthropogenic temperature pulse, not a pressure pulse that will destabilize methane hydrates under relic permafrost.

Finally, methane molecules in hydrates is not ‘in solution’ but rather in the hydrate crystalline lattice.",,,,"“The most recent prediction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that seas will rise by 60 to 90 centimetres this century. I think a rise of one to two metres is far more likely.”

","This range is not entirely accurate. Using different climate scenarios, global mean sea level is predicted to rise by 0.26 to 0.98 m by the end of the century. This does not include potential collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, which could raise these estimates. Recent work suggests that Antarctica’s contribution to sea level could contribute more than 1 m to sea level rise on top of the IPCC AR5 estimates.",,,,"“the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink.”

","Arctic sea ice is typically less than 4 m thick.

The use of ‘ice cap’ traditionally implies a body of ice on land that covers less area than an ice sheet; however, the article discusses sea ice, not an ice cap, which is floating ice that forms due to freezing of surface water.

","This is a misleading term. Ice caps are technically large land-based glaciers, whereas I think ‘Arctic icecaps’ here mean Arctic sea ice.

",,,"“‘Next year or the year after, the Arctic will be free of ice’”",The title is misleading. Wadhams suggests that the central Arctic (only) will be ice free in the summer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Analysis of “Disasters like Louisiana floods will worsen as planet warms, scientists warn”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/louisiana-flooding-natural-disaster-weather-climate-change-oliver-milman-the-guardian/,"Disasters like Louisiana floods will worsen as planet warms, scientists warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/louisiana-flooding-natural-disaster-weather-climate-change,"The historic and  are the latest in a series of heavy deluges that some climate scientists warn will become even more common as the world continues to warm.

On Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) is set to classify the Louisiana disaster as the eighth flood considered to be a once-in-every-500-years event to have taken place in the US in little over 12 months.

Since May of last year, dozens of people have been killed and thousands of homes have been swamped with water in extreme events in Oklahoma, Texas, South Carolina, West Virginia and Maryland. Noaa considers these floods extreme because, based on historical rainfall records, they should be expected to occur only once every 500 years.

The Louisiana flooding has been so exceptional that some places in the state experienced storm conditions considered once-every-1,000-year events. Close to 2ft of rain fell over a 48-hour period in parts of southern Louisiana, causing residents to scramble to safety from flooded homes and cars.

At least six people have died, with another 20,000 people having to be rescued. Even Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards had to evacuate after his governor’s mansion in Baton Rouge was swamped with chest-high water. A federal state of emergency has been declared, with 12,000 people crowding into shelters.

The National Weather Service balloon released in New Orleans on Friday showed near-record levels of atmospheric moisture, prompting the service to state: “We are in record territory.” Climate scientists have warned that the build-up of moisture in the atmosphere, driven by warming temperatures, is likely to cause a greater number of floods in the future.

“We have been on an upward trend in terms of heavy rainfall events over the past two decades, which is likely related to the amount of water vapor going up in the atmosphere,” said Dr Kenneth Kunkel, of the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites.

“There’s a very tight loop – as surface temperatures of the oceans warm up, the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere. We’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods.”

The number of heavy rainfall events in the US has risen well above the long-term average since the 1990s, with large regional variances. While the north-east, midwest and upper great plains have experienced a 30% increase in heavy rainfall episodes – considered once-in-every-five year downpours – parts of the west, particularly California, have been parched by drought.

Warmer air, influenced by heat-trapping gases released by human activity, can contain more water vapor than cooler air. With the extra heat helping nourish storms, scientists expect global warming to help produce more intense downpours.

“Assuming we don’t change our ways, warming is a virtual certainty and increased water vapor is virtual certainty,” Kunkel said. “That means increases in heavy rainfall is virtual certainty.”

While scientists are loathe to attribute any single event to changes in the climate, they state that warming temperatures are helping tip the scales towards altered precipitation. Some, however, bristle at the belief that because floods and storms have always occurred, they should not be linked to climate change.

Dr Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said the major floods seen in the US had a “clear human component in them. I have seen only a few reports and none mention climate change at all. It is pathetic.”

There are plenty of influences on rainfall levels, including natural variation and topography. One of the biggest variables will be how much warmer the world will become – Trenberth said each 1C increase in temperature can add 7% more moisture in the atmosphere. But plotting exact projections between warming and the magnitude of downpours is something scientists are still working on.

“Changes in the global water cycle in response to the warming over the 21st century will not be uniform,” states the latest IPCC assessment. “The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions.”

With the US suffering more weather-related disasters than any other country, an increase in rainfall, storm and hurricane intensity is something that could start demanding more attention from lawmakers.

“It’s prudent to consider that if you’re building something with a 100-year lifetime, it’s virtually certain that it will experience an increase in extreme rainfall,” Kunkel said. “We either pay now or pay later. If we build resiliency into infrastructure, we can protect life and property.”",high,"Accurate, Sound reasoning",98,"The article reports on the historic floods that recently occurred in Louisiana and discusses the influence of human-induced climate change on heavy-precipitation events.

Overall, the article correctly places this event in its climatic context: science clearly shows one should expect to observe more frequent intense rain events as the planet continues to warm, since it allows the atmosphere to contain more moisture. However, an increase in “flooding” severity related to global warming has not yet been clearly established.

","Overall, the article does a good job of putting the recent heavy rainfalls in Louisiana into the broad context of climate change. While generally we expect to see more heavy downpours as the climate warms, there is a crucial caveat that’s missing- changes in the frequency of some weather systems may mean that for particular locations we wouldn’t see more extreme rainfall events. In the absence of a specific attribution study examining the role of human-induced climate change in this kind of event, we cannot say for certain that climate change increased the likelihood or intensity of these recent rains.

This detail is particularly important in places like Louisiana where extreme rainfall events can arise from different weather systems, like hurricanes for example, and there is uncertainty in how climate change is influencing some of these weather events.

","This piece gives a pretty standard overview of the state of the science as it pertains to extreme rainfall events and their link to climate: theoretical and model evidence (and, increasingly, observations) suggest that daily extreme precipitation will become more intense, so that high-intensity thresholds will be exceeded more often.

The piece is also careful in providing some clarification that this general trend will not necessarily be universal. One possible nuance that might be worth noting is that the link between rainfall and flooding depends heavily on landscape modification as well.

",,,"Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University:","In my view, this article does a good job reporting on the recent floods in Lousiana and, more generally, the climate-change-induced changes in the water cycle that underlie scientists’ concerns about future increase in floods. However, “heavy rainfall” is not strictly synonymous to “flooding”, and I think it could have provided more context on what is known (or not known) about current, observed changes in floods.","Ben Henley, Postdoctoral research fellow, University of Melbourne","The article is accurate. The issue of increasing precipitation extremes due to climate change is presented well. Heavy precipitation increases have been observed, and are projected to worsen with climate change. The complexities of ocean-atmosphere circulation changes due to climate change are an area of active scientific research. Increased research in this area will help us answer the public’s questions on the human fingerprint on extreme events.

","Laurens Bouwer, Senior risk advisor, Deltares
","The article provides a good representation of the facts, and adds an evaluation of uncertainties, as well as pertinent quotes from experts. Various references to appropriate scientific documentation are provided as well.

Further, evidence exists attributing the increase in extreme rainfall to global warming, as summarized in the IPCC 5th report, and more importantly, there is a long line of work attributing changed likelihood of occurrence of single events -like the Louisiana flooding- to climate change (called ‘event attribution’).

Both of these topics are not mentioned explicitly, which makes the article quite careful and modest on these issues.","James Renwick, Professor, Victoria University of Wellington:","Very well-written and well-explained article, using the latest scientific understanding.

","Rasmus Benestad, Senior scientist, The Norwegian Meteorological institute:","This is an important news report, however, the actual problem is somewhat under-communicated since it mixes return value analysis for a single site with occurrences taking place over many sites. The situation is more dramatic because extreme rains and flooding could happen in many places, and the likelihood for seeing such events is much higher than the probability associated with one specific site.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“as surface temperatures of the oceans warm up, the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere. We’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods.”

","Exactly. Every degree C of warming equates to around 7% more water vapor in the air. Not only does this lead to heavier rain, it adds to the warming as water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas.",,,,"“While the north-east, midwest and upper great plains have experienced a 30% increase in heavy rainfall episodes – considered once-in-every-five year downpours – parts of the west, particularly California, have been parched by drought.”

","It is expected that an increased greenhouse effect will result in wet areas becoming wetter and dry regions drier because the atmospheric overturning (convection) will respond to the atmospheric opacity [1]. Overturning means air rising in some parts and sinking in others. Rising air (convection) brings moisture aloft where it cools, condenses, forms clouds, and precipitates. The descending air is dry as it is air that previously ascended and where the moisture has precipitated out during the ascent.

[1] A mental picture of the greenhouse effect",,,,"“The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions.”

","While this picture might provide a leading order approximation, it is mostly valid over the oceans. Over land, recent research has shown that the “wet get wetter, dry get drier” picture does not really apply and things are a little more complex (e.g., see: Byrne and O’Gorman. “The Response of Precipitation Minus Evapotranspiration to Climate Warming: Why the “Wet-Get-Wetter, Dry-Get-Drier” Scaling Does Not Hold over Land” Journal of Climate (2015).)",,,,"“On Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) is set to classify the Louisiana disaster as the eighth flood considered to be a once-in-every-500-years event to have taken place in the US in little over 12 months.”

","This last sentence seems to imply that this is exceptional. However, in a country as large as the USA, it is very well possible to have multiple events each year, that exceed 100 or 500-year frequency thresholds for a particular location. Note that for this case, for multiple locations, the 500-year rainfall amount was exceeded, which is indeed exceptional.

","As others pointed out, over a large area like the US, it is not necessarily out of the ordinary to have several places experience rare events – like record floods – in the same year. Further analysis would be required to see if the combination of these events is really unusual.

Overall, while there is an observed increase in heavy rainfall event that has been attributed to man-made global warming, changes in floods are more difficult to observe and attribute. The 2012 report on climate extremes from the IPCC indicates that “There is limited to medium evidence available to assess climate-driven observed changes in the magnitude and frequency of floods at regional scales because the available instrumental records of floods at gauge stations are limited in space and time, and because of confounding effects of changes in land use and engineering. […] Further, it points out that, so far, there is “Low confidence that anthropogenic warming has affected the magnitude or frequency of floods at a global scale.” […]

So the picture appears complex and uncertain, and while the title of this article is broadly consistent with the last quote above, caution is warranted when interpreting recent flooding events with respect to climate change.

For the US in particular, recent research indicates an increase in flooding frequency (but not necessarily magnitude) in the Northern Central US (see Mallakpour and Villarini. “The changing nature of flooding across the central United States.” Nature Climate Change (2015))",,,"“Noaa considers these floods extreme because, based on historical rainfall records, they should be expected to occur only once every 500 years.”

","This means that such a flood is expected to have a 1 in 500 chance of happening in any given year. It does not imply that such event occurs regularly every 500 years though.

That statistic would hold if the climate were not warming. Since warming is occurring, and the amount of moisture in the air is increasing, the odds of getting these floods are getting larger/more likely.

",,,,"“The National Weather Service balloon released in New Orleans on Friday showed near-record levels of atmospheric moisture, prompting the service to state: “We are in record territory.”

","The chart below from the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center shows that the amount of ‘Precipitable Water’ in the atmosphere over southern Louisiana (Baton Rouge) was unprecedented just before the flood.

This flood fits a pattern: a recent study found that most urban flood events over the past 40 years exhibit very high amounts of precipitable water in the atmosphere.

",,,,"“While scientists are loathe to attribute any single event to changes in the climate, they state that warming temperatures are helping tip the scales towards altered precipitation. Some, however, bristle at the belief that because floods and storms have always occurred, they should not be linked to climate change”

","It is true that floods and storms always have occurred, but they have always ocurred for a physical reason. This may be evidence suggesting that these phenomena are rather sensitive to a climate change, if modest natural changes in physical conditions already give rise to variations in the floods and storm activity. We now know that the earth’s atmosphere is changing (increased CO2 and a global warming). It would be naive to think that floods and storms do not change when important factors change while they have always changed in the past. It is also important to think about these concepts in a risk-analysis frame, and it is important to plan for various plausible scenarios.

","Observations over the US and many other places around the world show that heavy rain events have been becoming heavier over the last several decades. Climate models very consistently predict that this should happen as the climate warms, and basic physics leads us to interpret this change as, in large part, a consequence of increasing water vapor in the atmosphere. On this basis we can say that climate change has most likely increased the probability of an event like this. One still can’t say that climate change ’caused’ this event, as each event has many causes and no event can be viewed solely as a consequence of long-term trends.

No study can tell us that climate change caused an event like this to happen, full stop. Every weather event has many causes. Climate change is just one of them, and usually not the most immediate. At most it can push things a bit in one direction, making the weather more severe if it was going in that direction anyway. Attribution studies can describe and quantify that push.

"Analysis of “Environmental records shattered as climate change ‘plays out before us'”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/environment-climate-change-records-broken-international-report-oliver-milman-the-guardian/,Environmental records shattered as climate change ‘plays out before us',https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/02/environment-climate-change-records-broken-international-report,"The world is careening towards an environment never experienced before by humans, with the temperature of the air and oceans breaking records, sea levels reaching historic highs and carbon dioxide surpassing a key milestone, a major international report has found.

The “state of the climate” report, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) with input from hundreds of scientists from 62 countries, confirmed there was a “toppling of several symbolic mileposts” in heat, sea level rise and extreme weather in 2015.

“The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,” Michael Mann, a leading climatologist at Penn State, told the Guardian. “They are playing out before us, in real time. The 2015 numbers drive that home.”

Last year was the warmest on record, with the annual surface temperature beating the previous mark set in 2014 by 0.1C. This means that the world is now 1C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times, largely due to a huge escalation in the production of greenhouse gases. The UN has already said that 2016 is highly likely to break the annual record again, after 14 straight months of extreme heat aided by a hefty El Niño climatic event, a weather event that typically raises temperatures around the world.

The oceans, which absorb more than 90% of the extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere, also reached a new record temperature, with sharp spikes in the El Niño-dominated eastern Pacific, which was 2C warmer than the long-term average, and the Arctic, where the temperature in August hit a dizzying 8C above average.

The thermal expansion of the oceans, compounded by melting glaciers, resulted in the highest global sea level on record in 2015. The oceans are around 70mm higher than the 1993 average, which is when comprehensive satellite measurements of sea levels began. The seas are rising at an average rate of 3.3mm a year, with the western Pacific and Indian Oceans experiencing the fastest increases.

These changes are being driven by a CO2 concentration that surpassed the symbolic 400 parts per million mark at the Mauna Loa research station in Hawaii last year. The Noaa report states that the global CO2 level was a touch under this, at 399.4ppm, an increase of 2.2ppm compared to 2014.

Noaa said other “remarkable” changes in 2015 include the Arctic’s lowest maximum sea ice extent in the 37-year satellite record, recorded in February 2015. The world’s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet, which would balloon sea levels by around 7m should it disintegrate, experienced melting over more than 50% of its surface.

The rapid changes in the climate may have profound consequences for humans and other species. In June last year, a severe heatwave claimed over 1,000 lives in Karachi, Pakistan. Severe drought caused food shortages for millions of people in Ethiopia, with a lack of rainfall resulting in “intense and widespread” forest fires in Indonesia that belched out a vast quantity of greenhouse gas.

Diminishing sea ice is causing major walrus herds to haul themselves out on to land. Arctic marine species, such as snailfish and polar cod, are being pushed out of the region by species coming from further south, attracted to the warming waters. A huge algal bloom off the west coast of North America harmed marine life and fisheries.

Scientists have said there were underlying climate change trends at play but last year was also influenced by the strong El Niño event, which is when equatorial Pacific waters warm, leading to an array of weather effects around the world. El Niño has also helped spur searing heat in 2016 but has now petered out.

Thomas Karl, director of Noaa national centers for environmental information, said that last year’s climate “was shaped both by long-term change and an El Niño event. When we think about being climate resilient, both of these time scales are important to consider.

“Last year’s El Niño was a clear reminder of how short-term events can amplify the relative influence and impacts stemming from longer-term warming trends.”

Kate Willett, a senior scientist at Britain’s Met Office, said that there was a 75% annual increase in the amount of land that experienced severe drought last year.

“Looking at a range of climate measurements, 2015 was yet another highly significant year,” she said. “Not only was 2015 the warmest year on record by a large margin, it was also another year when the levels of dominant greenhouse gases reached new peaks.”

The state of the climate report is now in its 26th year. The peer-reviewed series is published annually by the American Meteorological Society.",high,"Accurate, Insightful",107,"The article summarizes the main findings of the “2015 state of the climate” report published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Overall it accurately reports the main findings that many global indicators of the Earth’s climate, notably the global surface temperature, have set new records in 2015 under the joint influence of ongoing human-induced climate change and a strong El Niño event. However, scientists noted a few issues with the article, such as minor errors, a lack of background and references for some key claims and a potentially misleading attribution of Indonesian fires to climate change.

","This article does a good job of summarizing results in the State of the Climate report. However, there are some areas (e.g., Greenland sea level rise contributions and extent of surface melt) where the information is not directly pertinent to modern-day effects of climate change or is presented without context. It is difficult to present so many scientific results regarding climate change in such a short article, and the author doesn’t always succeed at providing the necessary context. Nevertheless, the title clearly conveys the sum total of recent observations, which now show definite fingerprints of climate change in our annual weather.

","Jennifer Francis, Senior Scientist, Woods Hole Research Center
","The string of records broken and nearly broken in 2015 is stunning, and the story continues into the first half of 2016. Clearly a strong El Niño “juiced” the already disturbed climate system, but the Earth’s behavior in 2015 and recent months may be a preview of a future when global-average warming approaches the 2-degree C level that is generally expected to bring dangerous consequences.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,“This means that the world is now 1C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times”,"The temperature is 1°C warmer than in the beginning of the instrumental temperature record (1880). The 19th century was likely a little colder than the pre-industrial period. This difference is not large and currently being studied, but likely we did not cross the 1°C warming relative to pre-industrial yet.

",,,,"“The UN has already said that 2016 is highly likely to break the annual record again, after 14 straight months of extreme heat aided by a hefty El Niño climatic event, a weather event that typically raises temperatures around the world.“

","The influence of El Niño was likely not as large as it was in 1998. A large part of the warming was also in the Arctic, as Jan Lenaerts also argues below.

","I would say that it increases ‘global mean temperature’. An El Niño does not necessarily imply warming everywhere on Earth. Also, especially pronounced are the warm conditions in the Arctic, which are not explicitly mentioned here, but do not relate to the strong El Niño.

",,,"“The thermal expansion of the oceans, compounded by melting glaciers, resulted in the highest global sea level on record in 2015.”

","This statement in the AMS report refers to the satellite altimetry record, which reaches back to 1993. It is also important to remember that it refers to the global average sea level.

We do have local records of past sea level that extend further back in time, for instance tide gauge records or inferences based upon biological markers. For instance, combined tide gauge records have been used to infer global mean sea level rise (GMSL) over the 20th century and into the 21st century. The obtained estimate of the GMSL rise agrees with the satellite altimetry record in their overlap since 1993 (e.g., Hay et al., 2015: Probabilistic reanalysis of twentieth-century sea-level rise).

","Here “CO2” should be “heat” … according to the Scripps Institute, the uptake of CO2″ is about 26%.

",,,“The world’s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet … experienced melting over more than 50% of its surface.”,"That is correct, see figure below:

There was an event in the beginning of July when ~50% of the ice sheet experienced melt. This is clearly outside of the expected natural variability, but does not necessarily project the overall Greenland summer (since such melt events are extremely episodic). Overall, Greenland experienced a warm summer, with slightly more surface runoff than average and overall average amounts of snowfall (source)

","This is true. Perhaps more important, though, is that surface melt in Greenland started early this year and included several large spikes. While current surface melt is not currently larger than the record-breaking 2012 melt year, it is ahead of 2013-2015 so far. The NSIDC has an excellent summary of current melt status for Greenland here.

",,,“Greenland ice sheet … would balloon sea levels by around 7m should it disintegrate”,"This is a reasonable number for the total mean sea level rise if all of the Greenland Ice Sheet melted. Total melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet, however, is essentially impossible over the next several hundred years. Nevertheless, the Greenland Ice Sheet has been losing large amounts of ice and the rate of loss has increased over the recent decade or so (references include this paper and this one). The amount of ice Greenland has lost to date has already raised global sea levels and projections indicate the possibility of 0.5 m more sea level rise from Greenland alone over the coming several centuries.",,,,"“other “remarkable” changes in 2015 include the Arctic’s lowest maximum sea ice extent in the 37-year satellite record, recorded in February 2015.”

Analysis of “What science can tell us about the links between global warming and massive heat waves”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/science-about-links-between-global-warming-and-massive-heat-waves-chris-mooney-washington-post/,What science can tell us about the links between global warming and massive heat waves,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/07/21/what-science-can-tell-us-about-the-links-between-global-warming-and-massive-heat-waves/,"The United States is witnessing a massive, dangerous heat wave, as a huge system of high pressure covers the central part of the country. It’s a big enough deal that yesterday President Obama even tweeted about it, including a map showing the maximum heat index in some parts of the Midwest and Southeast reaching 110 or 115 degrees on Saturday.

Here in Washington, temperatures could break 100 degrees Friday or over the weekend.

This will, inevitably, lead to much talk of climate change in the coming days. So it’s important to separate the scientific wheat from the chaff and figure out what science can, and can’t, reliably say about the link between an event like this and a warming planet — especially in a year that, on a global scale, has shattered past temperature records for six out of the last six months.

And the gist is that when it comes to extreme heat waves in general — heat waves that appear out of the norm in some way, for instance in their intensity, frequency, or duration — while scientists never say individual events are “caused” by climate change, they are getting less and less circumspect about making some connection.

“As predictable as the sunrise, some will say heat waves always happened,” said Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and former president of the American Meteorological Society. “Yep, so did home runs in baseball, but the steroid era brought more and longer home runs. A new National Academies study suggests that ‘heat waves’ may be one of the primary climate change markers like home runs were in baseball.”

In other words, when a planet warms, the odds shift in favor of more intense or long lasting heat waves. That’s just plain logic.

Indeed, the National Academy of Sciences report in question notes that, “Confidence in attribution findings of anthropogenic influence is greatest for those extreme events that are related to an aspect of temperature, such as the observed long-term warming of the region or global climate, where there is little doubt that human activities have caused an observed change.”

“In particular, for extreme heat and cold events, changes in long-term mean conditions provide a basis for expecting that there should also be changes in extreme conditions.”

And we’ve definitely already had changes in not only “long-term mean conditions,” but in heat waves themselves. The U.S. National Climate Assessment found that U.S. heat waves have already “become more frequent and intense,” that the U.S. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records (just as you’d expect), and that it is seeing correspondingly fewer cold spells.

As for future projections, meanwhile, the assessment added that “Climate models project that the same summertime temperatures that ranked among the hottest 5% in 1950-1979 will occur at least 70% of the time by 2035-2064 in the U.S. if global emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to grow.”

However, pointing all of this out is not the same as making a specific attribution for this specific heat event — rather, it is saying that attribution can be made for this class or type of event. Beyond that, specific attribution requires active research, and an attention to the actual temperatures, duration and other aspects of the weather phenomenon. That’s because, as Shepherd notes, there are always heat waves, even in a stable climate.

Typically, in such an attribution study, scientists will use sets of climate models — one set including the factors that drive human global warming and the other including purely “natural” factors — and see if an event like the one in question is more likely to occur in the first set of models. Researchers are getting better and better at performing these kinds of studies fast, in near real time. So don’t be at all surprised if we see such a study for the current heat wave event — just as we saw for, most recently, the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, which was tied to an extreme marine heatwave off Australia’s northeastern coast.

But in the meantime, some scientists and experts aren’t holding back.

“With every heat wave, probably the number one question is, is it climate change, or is it not? Well the answer is, it’s both,” said Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe on a press call Thursday. “We get heat waves naturally, but climate change is amping them up, it’s giving them that extra energy, to make them even more serious, and have even greater impacts.”

Hayhoe didn’t attempt a specific attribution of the current heat wave, any more than Shepherd did. Rather, she’s once again articulating the general connection.

“We are not used to having heat waves that are extreme as the ones we see today,” she said.

It’s important to underscore, as Hayhoe did, that this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly — and also to crops across the U.S. heartland. She pointed to an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe, and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis. That event killed hundreds of people in Paris and London, and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths, themselves, to climate change.

So these links are real, if not always simple to characterize. Now, it’s all about watching this current event carefully, taking preparations, and seeing what scientists have to say once they run their analyses.",very_high,Accurate,143,"The Washington Post reports on the “massive heat wave” that is currently affecting the US and explores the question of how such events are related to human-induced global warming.

The scientists who have reviewed the article confirm that it accurately describes the state of scientific knowledge on the topic. While the observed increased frequency, severity and duration of heat waves in some parts of the world are among the most certain impacts of climate change, calculating any increases to the current heat wave’s probability or intensity as a result of global warming will require a specific study (called an “event attribution study”), which has not yet been performed for the current event as of July 25th.

","This is a well-written article that provides a good overall discussion around the connection between climate change and the ongoing US heat wave. In the absence of a specific event attribution study the role of climate change in this event can’t be quantified, but Chris Mooney provides an insightful overview of the role of climate change in heat events generally.

","I do not find anything wrong with the article. And it makes the key point that robust event attribution is now possible. However, the article could better help readers understand what ‘event attribution’ is in contrast to ‘predictions’. The article makes the point that it is now possible to attribute individual classes of extreme events to climate change: eg heat waves in a specific region and season. It is not clear in pointing out that the reason for having to do a specific ‘attribution study’ is to quantify the role anthropogenic climate change played in an event given the observed class of heat wave.

While on average we see an increase in heat wave frequency and intensity, there are parts of the world where there is actually hardly any increase (e.g. parts of India in the pre monsoon season) while for others the likelihood of certain types of heat waves to occur has increased at least 10 fold (eg Central Europe).

",,,"Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Senior researcher, KNMI (The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute)
","The article gives a fair and balanced view on the topic.

The one proviso that is not made that could have been added is that increasing air pollution with aerosols that block sunlight can counteract the effect of greenhouse gases on heat waves, as was the case in Europe up to the mid-1980s and is the case now in some other parts of the world such as India. However, the opposite is happening in the United States where clearer skies also increase the risk of severe heat waves. There are other factors, such as drying soils, that can exacerbate a heat wave, so indeed a specific study is needed to know how much the present heat wave can be attributed to global warming.

","Ken Caldeira, Senior Scientist, Carnegie Institution for Science
","This article is very good because it relies on quality documents including a National Academies report and the US Climate Assessment.

It quotes several scientists who reflect the broad consensus of scientists who work on extreme event attribution.

The story makes the point that with global warming, extreme heat waves will become more common and more intense, yet just as you cannot say with 100% confidence that a smoker would not have died of cancer had he not smoked, we cannot with 100% confidence attribute any particular heat wave to climate change. However, just as statistics, combined with mechanistic understanding, clearly demonstrate that smoking cigarettes causes cancer, statistics, combined with a mechanistic understanding of climate physics, clearly demonstrate that the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves.
Overall, an excellent article.

","The journalist is right regarding his main point: it cannot be told that global warming is the cause of a specific extreme event (unless it could not have existed without global warming); the issue must be addressed with probabilities, comparing all events we experience with all events we would have got without global warming.

However, the point is not well illustrated by the current heat wave in Eastern US, since this region is precisely known for showing negative long-term trends in many extreme heat indicators.

In summary, the main point is insightful and applies globally, but the journalist does not illustrate it with the most appropriate event, because projected increases in the indicators of extreme heat over Eastern US have not clearly got out of the natural variability so far.

","This is certainly true. Over the last few years we’ve seen more and more attribution statements related to heat waves (where there is higher confidence in the climate change link compared with other extremes, such as heavy rain events) and scientists have become more confident in making this connection.

","“Climate change” is by definition a shift in the weather statistics, such as the curve that describes the likelihood of temperatures exceeding a certain threshold [see figure below]. The temperature has a statistical character that is close to being bell-shaped (normal distribution), which implies that high temperatures are expected to be more frequent with a global warming – unless the typical range of temperatures (standard deviation) or shape of the curve changes as well. Climate is the typical character outlined by this curve (probability density function) describing the probabilities, whereas weather is each different data point on which this curve is based. When referring to one event – one data point – one talks about weather. Weather is not the same as climate, but they are related: climate is the expected weather.

","This is true and is also consistent with findings from other areas of the world.

","Only mentioning the deaths in two cities understates the danger of heat waves. The number of people who died in the 2003 heat wave is estimated to be in the tens of thousands. This article estimates it was 70 thousand additional deaths.

","The majority of injuries, illnesses, and deaths during heatwaves are preventable. A robust literature base documents individuals at higher risk during heatwaves, such as adults over the age of 65 years, infants, individuals with certain chronic diseases, and others. Heatwave early warning and response systems save lives; expanding these systems to more cities and increasing awareness of the health risks of high ambient temperatures could increase resilience as heatwaves increase in frequency, intensity, and duration.

Another issue is that growing confidence that climate change is increasing the probability of heatwaves means some deaths during heatwaves could be attributed to climate change.

","When the 2003 European heatwave occurred it killed 70 000 people. At the time the likelihood of that event occurring had doubled due to human influence. Now an event like this is 10 times more likely due to human influence.

"Analysis of “Scientists warn of ‘global climate emergency’ over shifting jet stream”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/climate-change-emergency-jet-stream-shift-warning-global-warming-extreme-weather-gabriel-samuels-the-independent/,Scientists warn of ‘global climate emergency’ over shifting jet stream,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/climate-change-emergency-jet-stream-shift-warning-global-warning-extreme-weather-a7111661.html,"Two environmentalists have declared a “global climate emergency” after the Northern hemisphere jet stream was found to have crossed the equator, bringing “unprecedented” changes to the world’s weather patterns.

Robert Scribbler and University of Ottawa researcher Paul Beckwith warned of the “weather-destabilising and extreme weather-generating” consequences of the jet stream shift.

However other scientists dismissed their claims, with one describing their concern over wind crossing the equator as ""total nonsense"".

Scribbler and Beckwith said the anomalies were most likely precipitated by man-made climate change, which caused the jet stream to slow down and create larger waves.

Scribbler wrote in a post on his environmental blog on Tuesday: “It’s the very picture of weather-weirding due to climate change. Something that would absolutely not happen in a normal world. Something, that if it continues, basically threatens seasonal integrity.

The blogger explained the barrier between the two jet streams generates the strong divide between summer and winter, and the “death of winter” could commence if it is eroded as warm weather leaks into the “winter zone” of the year.

He continued: “As the poles have warmed due to human-forced climate change, the Hemispherical Jet Streams have moved out of the Middle Latitudes more and more. You get this weather-destabilising and extreme weather generating mixing of seasons.”

Meanwhile, Mr Beckwith confirmed the changes would usher in a sustained period of “climate system mayhem” which could prove difficult to resolve.

He said: “Our climate system behaviour continues to behave in new and scary ways that we have never anticipated, or seen before.

“Welcome to climate chaos. We must declare a global climate emergency.

“The behaviour of the jet stream suggests massive hits to the [global] food supply and the potential for massive geopolitical unrest. There’s very strange things going on on planet Earth right now.”

There are two forms of jet streams - polar and subtropical - and the northern and southern hemispheres have one of each.

The streams are the products of atmospheric heating by solar radiation and kept in place by the force of inertia.",low,"Alarmist, Inaccurate, Misleading",441,"The article repeats claims made by two bloggers that upper-level winds crossing the equator would be an unprecedented consequence of climate change. In reality, such wind features are frequently observed and the central claim of the article is thus unsupported by science.

Note: The Independent has updated the article on July 1st, by:

changing the subtitle of the article from the initial “Experts say drastic weather changes could cause ‘massive hits to food supply’ and ‘death of winter’” to “Other scientists have since dismissed the claims as ‘total nonsense’”;
adding a sentence linking to a rebuttal of the claims that reads “However other scientists dismissed their claims, with one describing their concern over wind crossing the equator as “total nonsense”.”
Unfortunately the original inaccurate article has been shared 10k times on social media while the correction has only been shared 150 times (as of July 5th 2016).

","This article makes little sense. It uses scientific jargon, such as in the last paragraph, to make it sound “scientific”, but uses it so loosely that it has no meaning. I do not see any logic behind these wild claims, there are no connections with established research, and there is no discussion of statistical certainty. Moreover, wild attributions to anthropogenic climate change are made without any backing.
Winds routinely cross the equator in the monsoonal circulations. This happens every year, without any grave consequences for climate.

",,,,"Tim Woollings, Lecturer, University of Oxford","The article seems to truthfully repeat the bloggers claims, but with no attempt to verify these claims from other sources. Unfortunately the claims are ridiculous.

This snapshot is clearly just a weather pattern, rather than any long-term change. To put things in context, we do expect the jet streams to move in response to climate change, but only by a couple of degrees of latitude over the coming century.","Emmanuel M Vincent, Research Scientist, University of California, Merced:","This article reports on speculations made by bloggers without any appropriate fact-checking. Had the journalist contacted actual scientists, it would have been easy for him to understand that the claims are without any scientific substance. One can only wonder whether this lack of fact-checking is intentional to create a click-bait headline and generate buzz on social media.

","Jennifer Francis, Senior Scientist, Woods Hole Research Center:","It is true that there are often (but not always) two jet streams in each hemisphere. The hypothesis related to Arctic warming causing weaker zonal winds of the jet refers to the POLAR jet. This flow is driven primarily by the temperature difference between the Arctic and middle-latitudes.

The features headlined in this story, however, are a product of the SUB-TROPICAL jet, which is driven mainly by temperature differences between the tropics and middle-latitudes. The upper-level tropical atmosphere is also warming faster than most other places, which is increasing the temperature difference and thus contributing to a STRONGER sub-tropical jet [and not a weaker, wavier jet as this article suggests].

","Clifford Mass, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington:","This is total nonsense. Flow often crosses the equator. The cross-equator flow identified by Scribbler and Beckwith is not between mid-latitude jet streams, as claimed. The analysis is making mistakes that even one of my junior undergrads would not make. [this comment was originally published in a rebuttal to the bloggers’ claims in The Washington Post]

","Ken Caldeira, Senior Scientist, Carnegie Institution for Science
","This is an odd story because the subhead and the second quotes dismiss the central claim as being “total nonsense”. So, the story seems more-or-less accurate: “A couple of people make a strong claim that is likely to prove false and a bunch of other people denounce the claim as total nonsense”. The question therefore is not so much the accuracy of the story, but of the editorial decision to publicize something that was likely to prove total nonsense.

Further, the story reports on a blog post. I do not see any reference to any peer-reviewed paper. So again, the question is why is The Independent giving so much play to what appears to be an erroneous blog post?
I do not see this piece so much as a failure of reporting as a failure of proper editorial control.

"Analysis of “Thanks to climate change, the Arctic is turning green”",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/its-official-humans-are-making-the-earth-much-greener-washington-post-chris-mooney/,"Thanks to climate change, the Arctic is turning green",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/06/27/its-official-humans-are-making-the-earth-much-greener/,"Earlier this month, NASA scientists provided a visualization of a startling climate change trend — the Earth is getting greener, as viewed from space, especially in its rapidly warming northern regions. And this is presumably occurring as more carbon dioxide in the air, along with warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons, makes plants very, very happy.

Now, new research in Nature Climate Change not only reinforces the reality of this trend — which is already provoking debate about the overall climate consequences of a warming Arctic — but statistically attributes it to human causes, which largely means greenhouse gas emissions (albeit with a mix of other elements as well).

The roughly three-decade greening trend itself is apparent, the study notes, in satellite images of “leaf area index” — defined as “the amount of leaf area per ground area,” as Robert Buitenwerf of Aaarhus University in Denmark explains in a commentary accompanying the study — across most of the northern hemisphere outside of the tropics, a region sometimes defined as the “extratropics.” Granted, there are a few patches in Alaska, Canada and Eurasia where greening has not been seen.

Starting from this set of observations, the researchers, led by Jiafu Mao of Oak Ridge National Laboratory but including 18 others from multiple institutions in the United States, France, and China, conducted what scientists call a “detection and attribution” study. This is an experiment in which differing sets of climate model runs are used to determine whether a particular event or change — ranging from an extreme heat wave, to a coral bleaching event, to a major trend like Arctic greening — is more likely to happen in simulations that include human greenhouse gas emissions, than it is to happen in those that do not.

Sure enough, the greenhouse-gas filled computer simulations looked much more like the satellite observations than did simulations that only included natural variability. The study therefore concludes that “the trend of strengthened northern vegetation greening … can be rigorously attributed, with high statistical confidence, to anthropogenic forcings, particularly to rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.”

While this formal detection and attribution appears to be new, the report is at least the third study in the past several months alone to highlight northern hemisphere greening and to reinforce this basic conclusion. It’s one that has often been celebrated by climate change skeptics and contrarians who have long contended that global warming won’t be all bad, and that plants might help offset any global warming trend.

“We first find this kind of human fingerprint … particularly the greenhouse gas impact, on this kind of enhanced vegetation growth,” says Mao, the study’s lead author.

The researchers also dove in more closely to try to determine precisely why so much greening is happening in the Northern Hemisphere’s colder latitudes. Sure enough, the overall trend was tied to warmer temperatures, although in areas where greening was missing, declining precipitation trends seemed to partly explain the result as well. (The study did not discuss whether growing wildfires in northern forests may also be countering greening in some areas.)

Another factor enhancing plant growth, meanwhile, seems to be more human-induced falling of nitrogen out of the atmosphere, as we have amped up the global nitrogen cycle with our fertilizers and our fossil fuels (nitrogen also can enhance plant growth).

In his accompanying essay evaluating the research, Aarhus University’s Buitenwerf praises the study but notes that in some ways, the current satellite-based approach represents a blunt instrument. An examination of total leaf area, he notes, doesn’t record whether a particular area has changed its type of vegetation, say from smaller tundra shrubs to small trees.

Buitenwerf also notes that the science is less clear about what is happening in the global tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere, where greening trends are either less apparent, or more difficult to explain.

Still, the subtext of all of this research is clear — a key fraction of all the greenhouse gases that humans pour into the atmosphere each year is pulled back into plants through the process of photosynthesis. This is happening even as the overall warming of the planet may, by lengthening growing seasons and moistening the atmosphere, further stoke plant growth. They don’t call it the “greenhouse effect” for nothing.

The key question then becomes how much this process can offset overall global warming over time. And that’s quite unclear.

There’s a lot, after all, that we don’t understand. For instance, a recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report found that while Arctic tundras have indeed been greening over the past 30 years, in the past two to four years, that trend has reversed itself.

“Although we already identify this kind of human impact on this historical vegetation growth, for the future, it’s hard to predict,” says Mao. He said he is not sure to what extent the greening trend will continue, as “disturbances” like wildfires might counteract it, or plants may become “acclimated to this kind of high temperature.”

Still, the trend is already prompting more optimistic assessments of our climate future in some quarters. Arctic greening was recently cited, in a major report by the U.S. Geological Survey, as the central reason that the state of Alaska, despite worsening wildfires and more thaw of permafrost, might still be able to stow away more carbon than it loses over the course of the 21st century.

It is clear, then, that greening is emerging as a factor with the potential to blunt some of the worst impacts of human greenhouse gas emissions. But thus far, researchers do not seem to be arguing that it’s enough to counterbalance the entire human-induced warming trend.

“While we are perhaps lucky that CO2 has this effect on plant physiology, in addition to being a greenhouse gas, it is not our ‘get out of jail free’ card when it comes to our ongoing emissions of CO2,” climate scientist Richard Betts of the U.K.’s Hadley Centre wrote recently.

Instead, global greening is perhaps better taken as yet another indicator, visible from space, of how much we are causing the Earth to change.

“Given the strong evidence provided here of historical human induced greening in the northern extratropics, society should consider both intended and unintended consequences of its interactions with terrestrial ecosystems and the climate system,” the new study concludes.","neutral, high","Accurate, Sound reasoning, Unbiased",261,"Overall the article accurately reports that increased temperatures and atmospheric CO2, due to human greenhouse gas emissions, are already increasing plant growth in the Arctic region. However, scientists point to some misleading aspects of the article: most problematically, the author leaves open the hypothesis that the increased CO2 uptake by plants in the Arctic could significantly offset future global warming. In reality, scientists already take into account CO2 uptake by plants in climate projections and conclude that Arctic greening is very unlikely to have a significant impact on the global carbon cycle.

","The main message of this article – that the Arctic is greening, and that this trend is caused by anthropogenic climate change – is accurate and well-explained. The author also addresses the complexity of the trend’s potential impacts on the Arctic itself and on global greenhouse gas concentrations.
","The article is a poster child for a lot of what is wrong with even our “hypothetically” best mainstream press coverage of science and the environment. The article is factually accurate (up to a point) but incomplete. It is true that rising CO2 and longer growing seasons likely will increase LAI [leaf area index] and productivity in certain northern regions, but the article gives the impression (by intentionally or unintentionally conflating northern regions and the rest of the world) that this may be widespread. Additionally, and equally or more problematically, the article is imbalanced in not fully acknowledging that the scale of net positive impacts (in terms of increased carbon gain) in far northern regions will likely only partially offset:

carbon losses from high latitude ecosystems (e.g. soil carbon losses from peatlands and permafrost due to decomposition, respiration and/or fire),
climate-change induced losses of productivity in the tropics, and
climate-change induced losses of carbon from increased wildfires in southern boreal and temperate coniferous forests.
Thus the article fails my “objectivity” test in being more about making a news splash than about reporting these important findings accurately framed within the overall broader context.

",,,"Ken Caldeira, Senior Scientist, Carnegie Institution for Science:","Overall, this is an excellent article. It not only reports the key scientific findings but also highlights several key uncertainties. This article nicely balances a description of what we think we know with a description of what we know we don’t know. Overall, I would consider this an exemplary piece of science journalism.

My one critique would be the assumption implicit in the reporting that greening is all good. While greening is good for some things, greening can be disruptive to ecosystems. Organisms that were well-adapted to harsher conditions might find themselves at an ecological disadvantage as conditions ameliorate, and thus there will be winners and losers. Thus greening can have adverse consequences for biodiversity.

This implicit assumption that greening is good is reflected in the title of the piece, raising the issue of who or what we should ‘thank’ for the greening.
Overall, however, this is a thoughtful and nuanced piece of scientific reporting.

","Jake Weltzin, Program Manager, US Geological Survey","Overall a nice description of the state of the science; well-referenced and linked; outlines the uncertainties; describes how this work builds on, but is different from, prior work.

","Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University:","This article reports on a new high-profile study that formally attributes the documented greening of the Arctic to human greenhouse gas emissions. The article correctly places this new research in its context (the greening had been observed before, but not explained) and identifies what is new in the study.

However, the author then goes on to discuss the implications of this greening for the carbon cycle, and somehow implies that these results about Arctic greening are new cause for optimism, as greening will be associated with CO2 absorption by the land which will slow down global warming. This whole discussion, in my view, was confused and potentially misleading for readers. The distinction between “greening” and ecosystems being a potential sink/source of carbon is not well presented. Arctic greening is well documented, but whether this means the Arctic is storing more and more carbon (and will keep doing so in the future) is unclear, and a topic of ongoing research. The article also seems to imply that these results are new cause for optimism because the land carbon uptake was somehow not accounted for in climate projections. This is incorrect. It is already well established that the land takes up about 25% of our CO2 emissions. Observations of greening at high latitudes are consistent with our expectations. The land carbon sink is already accounted for in climate change projections. There are some uncertainties, but the issue is mostly whether this sink will persist or decrease – not, as the author implies here, whether it will somehow go up to offset the entirety of human CO2 emissions and associated global warming.
","Jean-François Exbrayat, Post-doctoral Research Fellow, The University of Edinburgh:","The article reports about recent evidence that terrestrial ecosystems are ‘greening’ in response to human activities, principally the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. The author presents this ‘greening’ as a new finding while annual global carbon budgets have reported that about 25% of the fossil-fuel emissions have been taken up by the biosphere since the 1960s. Nothing is fundamentally wrong in the article but it is organized in a somewhat misleading way, with a high risk that the title could be taken out of context by “skeptics”.

","The article is quite neutral and balanced. It describes the Arctic greening and its attribution to climate change and CO2 increase, also mentioning uncertainties. The article concludes by saying that “researchers do not seem to be arguing that it’s enough to counterbalance the entire human-induced warming trend”. On the contrary, this should be seen as evidence that “we are causing the Earth to change”.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Earlier this month, NASA scientists provided a visualization of a startling climate change trend — the Earth is getting greener, as viewed from space, especially in its rapidly warming northern regions. And this is presumably occurring as more carbon dioxide in the air, along with warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons, makes plants very, very happy.”

","The point in the second sentence may be true for areas where longer growing seasons and warmer temperatures do increase productivity, but it is likely false for vast other regions of the world where lack of moisture will outweigh positive impacts of global change on growth. So this sentence right off the bat gives a bit of a misrepresentation by being worded in a way that can be construed as applying globally not just in the far north. Also there is nothing “startling” about this trend – it is exactly as hypothesized for such regions.

",,,,"“This is happening even as the overall warming of the planet may, by lengthening growing seasons and moistening the atmosphere, further stoke plant growth.”

","… note that relative humidity over land, near the surface, is projected to decrease with global warming (i.e., humidity increases more slowly than temperature over land). This has been observed in the past 10-15 years (although the role of variability is still unclear). So “moistening of the atmosphere”, as far as vegetation is concerned, is not accurate (at least globally).

See: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/2013-state-climate-humidity

",,,,“The key question then becomes how much this process can offset overall global warming over time. And that’s quite unclear. “,"Exactly. While the “greening” via extra plant growth could help put a brake on climate change, it depends on plants having enough water, and temperatures they thrive in. Neither of these are guaranteed in future, and the greening could easily become browning as the years pass. The overall effect on atmospheric concentrations of CO2 is likely to be small.

",,,,"“He said he is not sure to what extent the greening trend will continue, as “disturbances” like wildfires might counteract it, or plants may become “acclimated to this kind of high temperature””

","The Duke FACE [free-air CO2 enrichment] experiment also showed that it is not clear whether nutrient availability will continue supporting high rates of plant productivity despite higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

",,,,"“It is clear, then, that greening is emerging as a factor with the potential to blunt some of the worst impacts of human greenhouse gas emissions.”

","In fact, experts agree that the greening of the arctic is unlikely to even offset the increased carbon release from the arctic itself (much less the rest of the world) in a changing climate, for instance by permafrost melting:


The figure above is from a 2016 study that was authored by 100 expert researchers in various fields of arctic climate research, which concludes: “Our study highlights that Arctic and boreal biomass should not be counted on to offset permafrost carbon release and suggests that the permafrost region will become a carbon source to the atmosphere by 2100 regardless of warming scenario.”

",,,,"“Still, the trend is already prompting more optimistic assessments of our climate future in some quarters. Arctic greening was recently cited, in a major report by the U.S. Geological Survey, as the central reason that the state of Alaska, despite worsening wildfires and more thaw of permafrost, might still be able to stow away more carbon than it loses over the course of the 21st century.”","a) This is highly uncertain, because, as discussed, the future of the greening trend is unclear b) it is only for Alaska, and is unlikely to make a significant difference for “our climate future” as the author mentions. c) even if it could be generalized to the entire Arctic, or the entire land, it is no cause for “optimism”: as discussed above, the land is already a carbon sink. It might remain one in the future, despite climate change, but the risk is actually that it decreases and leaves us with more of our emissions accumulating in the atmosphere.

",,,,"“climate change skeptics and contrarians … have long contended that global warming won’t be all bad, and that plants might help offset any global warming trend.”

","It is not only a skeptic’s argument: the land biosphere does offset part of the warming by taking up 25% of emissions. However, the uncertainty in the durability of this pattern is very large with no clear consensus between earth system models used in the IPCC latest assessment report, see Figure below:

From Friedlingstein et al (2014) Uncertainties in CMIP5 Climate Projections due to Carbon Cycle Feedbacks, Journal of Climate

",,,,"“But thus far, researchers do not seem to be arguing that it’s enough to counterbalance the entire human-induced warming trend.”

","Of course not. This sentence is highly misleading. As indicated above, the land carbon sink is a well-established phenomenon, not a new theory based on new observations related to Arctic greening and that somehow scientists would now be debating to know whether it will offset global warming entirely. Nobody is even talking about that. The issue is whether the current carbon sink (25% of our emissions) will maintain itself or decrease.

","The “land sink” offsets about 25% of fossil-fuel emissions annually*. The long-term durability of the sink is debatable as it may be threatened by simultaneous enhancements of soil respiration due to warmer temperatures and more substrate availability (permafrost thaw in particular) but with a large climate-driven variability.

*data source: www.globalcarbonproject.org
","In terms of ecosystems being a carbon sink/storage or source to the atmosphere, it is essential we consider soils and soil microbes. The majority of Arctic ecosystem carbon is stored in the SOILS. With enhanced plant productivity, there is more “microbial food” in the form of organic carbon from plants going to the soils. More microbial food means more microbial metabolism/decomposition of organic carbon to CO2, which is an important SOURCE of carbon (CO2) to the atmosphere with a climate warming effect. To understand what is going on with Arctic ecosystem-climate interactions, we need to know what is going on with ecosystem respiration (C source to atmosphere) not just productivity (C sink from the atmosphere and the topic of the article on increasing “greeness”). In ecosystem ecology there is a finding of a “priming” effect on soil microbial C decomposition, where a small amount of yummy, labile C (the new green stuff coming from plants) can stimulate the decomposition and release to the atmosphere of very old, less yummy recalcitrant forms of C that had been stored in soils for a long time.  This could actually result in more carbon being released to the atmosphere by Arctic ecosystems than they took from the atmosphere to support the measured enhancement in greenness.",,"“new research in Nature Climate Change not only reinforces the reality of this trend — which is already provoking debate about the overall climate consequences of a warming Arctic — but statistically attributes it to human causes, which largely means greenhouse gas emissions (albeit with a mix of other elements as well).”

","That’s a good summary of what’s new in this study: Arctic greening had been documented before, its causes had been discussed, but this is the first study to formally attribute this greening trend to human gas emissions. Note that trends in surface temperature and in some aspects of the hydrological cycle (e.g., precipitation, evaporation) have been detected and attributed similarly; this is the first study to do so with vegetation trends (which appear closely related to temperature trends, though).

","While the NASA project is a wonderful visualization with impressive details and scale, the trend of Arctic greening is not startling to scientists. Researchers have been studying the increase in plant growth in the arctic for well over two decades at this point. The author notes this later in his article, but framing the pattern as surprising for the lede is somewhat disingenuous. Whether the trend is slowing or reversing itself, why some areas are browning rather than greening, or what the long-term consequences might be are still very much debated, but the pattern itself is extremely well-established.

"Analysis of “…in many ways global warming will be a good thing”
Published in The Telegraph, by Bjorn Lomborg on 5 May 2016",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-telegraph-bjorn-lomborg-in-many-ways-global-warming-will-be-good-thing/,"No one ever says it, but in many ways global warming will be a good thing",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/05/no-one-ever-says-it-but-in-many-ways-global-warming-will-be-a-go/,"Last week, a study in the prestigious journal Nature revealed just how much CO₂ increases have greened the Earth over the past three decades. Because CO₂ acts as a fertilizer, as much as half of all vegetated land is persistently greener today. This ought to be a cause for great joy.

Instead, the BBC focused on warning that the paper shouldn’t make us stop worrying about global warming, with threats like melting glaciers and more severe tropical storms. Many other major news outlets did not even report on the study.

Our climate conversation is lopsided. There is ample room to suggest that climate change has caused this problem or that negative outcome, but any mention of positives is frowned upon. We have known for decades that increasing CO₂ and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century, it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent.

Similarly, we know that many more people die from cold than from heat. The biggest study on heat and cold deaths, published last year in Lancet, examined more than 74 million deaths from 384 locations in 13 countries from cold Sweden to hot Thailand. The researchers found that heat causes almost one-half of one percent of all deaths, while more than 7 percent are caused by cold.

As global warming pushes temperatures up, more people will die in heat waves; a point emphasized by campaigners like UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres. What we don’t hear from her is that fewer people will die from cold. One study for England and Wales shows that heat kills 1,500 annually and cold kills 32,000. By the 2080s, increased heat-waves will kill nearly 5,000 in a comparable population. But ‘cold deaths’ will have dropped by 10,000, meaning 6,500 fewer die altogether.

Only mentioning the negatives distorts and degrades the political conversation. Any reasonable person can recognize both positives and negatives among the policy proposals of both Tories and Labour. It is an extreme partisan that insists either side offers only negatives.

Yet, this is the position enforced by the climate alarmists – last seen in a letter to The Times from Lord Krebs and company, essentially telling the newspaper to stop reporting less-than-negative climate stories. While it is true any individual news story rarely represents the whole truth, it is revealing that such campaigners don’t send out similar letters to correct the daily deluge of alarmist stories.

The idea that climate is bad for all good things and good for all bad things belongs in a morality play. In the real world, we should look at all the available information. When the BBC warns of more severe tropical storms, it has some validity. The UN’s climate panel expects to see fewer but stronger hurricanes. But it is an incomplete picture.

As the world develops, it has become much less vulnerable: a hurricane hitting Florida kills few people while a similar event in Guatemala kills tens of thousands. Indeed, climate-related deaths have dropped from half a million per year in the 1920s to less than 25,000 per year in the 2010s. A recent Nature study expecting more severe hurricanes from global warming still found that damages would halve from 0.04 per cent to 0.02 per cent of global GDP, because the increased ferocity would be more than made up by increased prosperity and resilience.

When the BBC warns of melting glaciers it is reminiscent of Al Gore’s concern that 40 per cent of the world get drinking water from the Himalayas, and melting glaciers mean “those 40 per cent of the people on Earth are going to face a very serious shortage.” Yet, a new study of 60 climate models and scenarios shows this warning fails to take into account the fact that global warming will mean precipitation increases. Indeed, water flow will actually increase over this century, which is likely beneficial in increasing “water availability in the Indus Basin irrigation scheme during the spring growing seasons.”

If our climate conversation managed to include the good along with the bad, we would have a much better understanding of our options. Climate economics does just that, taking all the negatives (like rising sea levels and more heat deaths) and all the positives (a greener planet, fewer cold deaths). A climate economics approach finds that today – contrary to the alarmists’ massive insistence on negatives-only stories – global warming causes about as much damage as benefits. Over time, climate becomes a net problem: by the 2070s, the UN Climate Panel finds that global warming will likely cause damage equivalent to 0.2 per cent to 2 per cent of global GDP. This is certainly not a trivial cost, but nor is it the end of the world. It is perhaps half the social cost of alcohol today.

This suggests that a policy which could eradicate global warming for 1 per centof global GDP would probably be a good deal. Unfortunately, we do not have such a deal on the table. The Paris climate treaty will cost around 2 per cent of global GDP and fix much less than a tenth of the problem. Less effective but more ambitious climate policies cost at least 6 per cent of global GDP per year and likely much more. Wind and solar, which covers less than half of one percent of global energy, costs dozens of times more than their climate benefits. Electric cars provide perhaps a thousandth in climate benefit of their substantial public subsidies. Biofuels are just hugely costly while increasing emissions.

When we shift the climate conversation to describe positives along with negatives, and focus on costs and benefits of policies – essentially treating this challenge like any other policy agenda – it becomes obvious how many of today’s accepted climate policies are poor.  Little wonder climate campaigners do not want this sort of conversation.","low, very_low","Biased, Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",470,"Bjorn Lomborg’s article in The Telegraph argues that “global warming causes about as much damage as benefits”, in blatant disagreement with available scientific evidence, while the author does not offer adequate evidence to support his statements.

While Lomborg argues in favor of more balanced climate reporting, the scientists who have reviewed this article conclude Lomborg himself fails to balance the available evidence that adverse impacts of climate change overwhelm the positive ones.

","Lomborg cites the Cramer et al study, on which I was a co-author, in support of the “good news” that rising CO2 is greening the planet. While this is true at the moment, Lomborg fails to point out the main result of the Cramer et al study, which is that the greening effect of CO2 is projected to show diminishing returns as CO2 continues to increase, while the negative impact of climate change itself continues to increase. Indeed the study projected a decline in tropical net primary productivity after 2050. I’ve not had chance to check the sources for the rest of his article, but if he’s prepared to spin one paper to give the opposite impression to its actual message, is he doing this with others?

",,,,,,,"“global warming causes about as much damage as benefits.”

","The studies of the aggregate economic impacts from global warming synthesized in the last IPCC (Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change) do not support the claim that benefits from climate change counterbalance the costs. All but one study find net costs, and the study finding aggregate benefits at the global level is focusing on a very low warming (+1°C). Since the IPCC assessment report, new studies have evaluated economic costs and benefits from climate change. Notably, Burke et al 2015 (Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production) do find some net benefits for a limited number of countries, but at the global level the net economic effect corresponds to costs.

","This claim is not supported by any source. Read the IPCC synthesis report Summary for Policy-Makers (SPM) headlines for a balanced assessment: “Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.” …

",,,"“we should look at all the available information.”

","Yes indeed, this is exactly what the IPCC does. I agree with Lomborg that having unbalanced views, only showing negative outcomes, is not helpful. But this is also true for this article that attempts to only show positive outcomes. Planet will get greener, less people will die in winter, the developed world is less vulnerable, precipitation will increase … All of these statements are severely biased, only telling half of the story (if not less…).

",,,,"“If our climate conversation managed to include the good along with the bad, we would have a much better understanding of our options.”

","True, but the author should set the example and have a balanced view here, showing the bad along with the good. Something he dramatically failed to do.

",,,,"“Any reasonable person can recognize both positives and negatives among the policy proposals of both Tories and Labour.”

","Lomborg seems to imply here that the assessment of the impacts of climate change should follow the same “balance” with which we consider political ideas. But the assessment of the global impacts of climate change is something scientific in nature. It’s not a matter of values or preferences, like political leaning. All things considered, it just so happens, as the IPCC points out, that the global impacts of climate change appear negative.

",,,,"“Over time, climate becomes a net problem: by the 2070s, the UN Climate Panel finds that global warming will likely cause damage equivalent to 0.2 per cent to 2 per cent of global GDP.”

","While a costs/benefits analysis of the impacts of climate change is certainly informative, we have to keep in mind that we probably cannot evaluate very well all the future costs associated with it, e.g., rising sea levels, ecosystems shifts, changes in water resources, etc. The numbers cited by Lomborg are thus likely conservative, and reflective of modest climate change (~2C). This is what the IPCC report Lomborg cites actually says: “…the incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for additional temperature increases of ~2°C are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income (±1 standard deviation around the mean) (medium evidence, medium agreement). Losses are more likely than not to be greater, rather than smaller, than this range (limited evidence, high agreement)…” [read more]",,,,"“Because CO₂ acts as a fertilizer, as much as half of all vegetated land is persistently greener today. This ought to be a cause for great joy.”

","The Nature study quoted provides nice evidence of the CO2 fertilization effect on global ecosystems, but as the author notes further down, it doesn’t really come as a surprise, if anything because we know that the land is absorbing about a quarter of human CO2 emissions (if this wasn’t happening atmospheric CO2 would be increasing even faster than it is now). So it is consistent with the land currently acting as a carbon sink; now the question really is, what happens to this land carbon sink as we go forward? The CO2 fertilization effect can be expected to level off, in particular as other nutrients become limiting for plant growth (nitrogen, phosphorus), whereas the effects of climate change will increase, with warmer temperatures and more intense water stress likely leading to more ecosystem carbon loss. Overall, when considering all the relevant science – something the IPCC does, but Lomborg fails to do here – the future of the land carbon sink under the combined effects of increased CO2 and climate change, remains highly uncertain – certainly not as rosy as Lomborg implies in this article.

","The impression given by this statement is that CO2 fertilisation of vegetation growth outweighs all the adverse impacts of climate change. Joy or concern should be based upon an assessment of all the impacts and not just on one aspect, as done here. Comprehensive assessments (e.g. IPCC WG2) consistently find climate change to be a cause for much concern, not for “much joy”, as claimed by the author.

","This is a naive statement because scientists have found that although higher concentrations of CO2 stimulate carbohydrate production and plant growth, they also deplete plants of nutrition through lowering the levels of protein and essential minerals. This impacts animal species’ food sources as well as a number of widely consumed crops, such as wheat, rice, and potatoes, which could greatly impact human health. (Loladze, 2014)

",,"“precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener”

","This is highly uncertain. The CO2 and precipitation trends will also be accompanied by increasing temperatures and increasing drought, which is likely to harm vegetation. The balance of these factors is still unclear.

",,,,"“global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century, it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent.”

","This is an inaccurate description of the science. The future of global biomass and the land carbon sink is highly uncertain and spans anywhere from a large increase to a large loss of biomass. The paper cited is wildly out of date (from 2001) and models have progressed immensely since then. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that even these more recent models are over-optimistic (e.g. Allen et al 2015)

","Actually, this statement of Lomborg correctly cites our study from 2001, […] The problem is that CO2-driven biomass growth in itself does not represent good news: for many agricultural crops, for example, the direct effects of high temperatures will outweigh the growth benefits eventually, notably for spring wheat and soybean. These aspects are discussed, in a well-balanced way, by the latest IPCC report, citing numerous references.

",,,"“We have known for decades that increasing CO₂ and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century, it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent.”","In short, the negative effect of climate change is expected to largely offset the positive effect of increasing CO2.

","According to the Nature Climate Change study, “Climate change is expected to cause global tropical cyclone damage to increase by US$53 billion per year” by 2100. Although it is true that Gross World Product (GWP) is expected to rise faster, it does not necessarily do so in the same places that storm damage increases. There is much uncertainty in both the tropical cyclone projections (discussed in the Nature Climate Change paper) and in GWP projections, but in any case, increasing damage from tropical cyclones is nothing to celebrate.

Indeed, water flow will actually increase over this century, which is likely beneficial in increasing “water availability in the Indus Basin irrigation scheme during the spring growing seasons.” ”

","The cited study states that runoff in the Indus basin will increase during the first half of the 21st century, mainly due to increasing glacier melt (not precipitation increase as mentioned here). This increase in flow from glacier melt is projected to decrease during the 2nd half of the 21st century (Immerzeel et al, 2013: Rising river flows throughout the twenty-first century in two Himalayan glacierized watersheds). … Besides, an increase in frequency and magnitude of hydrological extremes (flooding events) is projected. [read more]

","The issue of drinking water availability is more nuanced than either extreme represented here. Increases in glacier melt can have a wide range of impacts depending on the location and timing of the change. For example, complete loss of an alpine glacier that is used for summer drinking water can result in dramatic water shortages for those communities. On the other hand, increasing glacier melt can mean short term (decades) increases in river water – such as for the upper Indus basin noted in this study. Unfortunately, increased water availability from glacier loss is bound to end once those glaciers disappear.

",,,"“What we don’t hear from her is that fewer people will die from cold.”

","Every report I have ever read about the impacts of climate change on temperature-related deaths discuss both the impacts of heat and cold. Such as the new USGCRP Health report:

“Based on present-day sensitivity to heat, an increase of thousands to tens of thousands of premature heat-related deaths in the summer [Very Likely, High Confidence] and a decrease of premature cold-related deaths in the winter [Very Likely, Medium Confidence] are projected each year as a result of climate change by the end of the century. Future adaptation will very likely reduce these impacts (see Changing Tolerance to Extreme Heat Finding). The reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions [Likely, Medium Confidence].”

","This claim is not supported by available evidence and has been thoroughly discussed in a previous Climate Feedback analysis of an op-ed by Bjorn Lomborg.

For instance, Aaron Bernstein, Associate Director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard commented:

“While it’s true that cold may kill more people today than heat, Lomborg’s assertion that climate change will result in fewer overall deaths in the U.S. this century from extreme temperatures is not supported by available evidence.”",,,"“No one ever says it, but in many ways global warming will be a good thing”","The title is inaccurate. The IPCC, for example, a leading and authoritative source of climate change information, includes benefits as well as adverse effects in its assessment. Even the second sentence of its Working Group 2 Summary for Policymakers (SPM) notes that there are potential benefits, and some of these are covered in the remainder of the SPM. While the author may feel that the balance isn’t right, it is inaccurate to say that the potential benefits are never stated.

","There are many blogs that also claim that “global warming will be a good thing”… However, when it comes to robust, reviewed and assessed science, as done by IPCC, global warming will not be a good thing… It will have positive effects in some regions, but also negative effects in others. The overall balance is getting predominantly negative with increased level of warming. Read IPCC 5th Assessment report, Summary for Policymakers from Working Group 1 and Working Group 2.

"Analysis of “Great Barrier Reef may perish by 2030s…”

A World Heritage site, it is currently under assault from unusually hot ocean temperatures, which is causing widespread coral bleaching that is damaging and, in some cases, even killing the reefs. 

Now a new study by scientists at the Australian Research Council finds that the ongoing bleaching event is mainly due to human-caused global warming, and that if global warming proceeds as currently expected, ""large parts"" of the Great Barrier Reef could die by the mid-2030s. 

The study has not yet been submitted for peer review in a scientific journal. And until this study is reviewed and published in a scientific journal, its results should be treated as preliminary, but consistent with other recent climate science research.

The study examines what has caused ocean temperatures to spike to record highs in the Coral Sea region, which encompasses much of the Great Barrier Reef, including the hardest-hit northern reaches. 

""This area has recorded a big increase in temperatures over the past century, with March 2016 being the warmest on record,"" the researchers wrote in a piece published at The Conversation on Thursday, a website that publishes academic works.

Coral bleaching occurs when coral expels the algae that lives in its tissue, giving it color and nutrients. This action, caused by stresses such as increased water temperature and pollution, leaves the coral skeleton exposed, making it more susceptible to heat stress, disease and pollution.

The analysis used methods that have also been used to analyze other extreme weather and climate events, including record heat waves and extreme precipitation events. 

The scientists found that human-caused global warming made the record warm ocean temperatures and related bleaching events seen this year at least 175 times more likely to occur. The analysis found that climate change increased ocean temperatures by 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, during March. 

The study projects that this year's extreme warmth is likely to occur every two years in the month of March by the year 2034. 

The analysis' findings dovetail with other research that has predicted the mass die-off of coral reefs around the planet by the year 2050, as waters warm and exceed the tolerance level of many coral reef systems. 

“We have loaded the odds against the survival of one of the world’s greatest natural wonders” 

“These extreme temperatures will become commonplace by the 2030s putting a great strain on the ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef,” said lead author Andrew King of the ARC centre of excellence for climate system science, in a statement.

“We have loaded the odds against the survival of one of the world’s greatest natural wonders,” he said.

Although the study has yet to be peer-reviewed, the methods used to detect the role of climate change in extreme events are becoming more firmly established in the climate science community.

""We hope to submit a more comprehensive version of this analysis for peer-review soon,"" King told Mashable in an interview.

Such extreme event attribution studies have been used to detect the influence of human-caused global warming in other extreme temperature events. 

For this study, researchers looked at temperature data and computer model simulations that included only natural factors that alter the climate, compared to simulations that include human emissions of greenhouse gases. 

They found that the simulations that include greenhouse gases best fit the temperature data, and using statistical techniques they calculated the amount of the ocean warming that should be attributed to human-caused global warming, something known as ""fractional attributable risk.""

In a blog post, the researchers said that they released the results prior to peer review ""because of the grave nature of their findings and importance of the Great Barrier Reef to all Australians."" 

“We are confident in the results because these kind of attribution studies are well established, but what we found demands urgent action if we are to preserve the reef,” King said.

“For this reason, we felt it was vital to get our findings out as quickly as possible.”

Coral reefs as the tripwire for ""dangerous interference"" with climate 
The new analysis adds more evidence for those who argue that global warming may already be causing ""dangerous interference with the climate system."" 

That vague phrase from a 1992 U.N. climate treaty established what the nations of the world should work to avoid by cutting emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane.

The Paris Agreement on climate change, which 172 countries signed on April 22, maintains that goal as its ultimate objective, without defining it. 

This new analysis suggests we have already crossed into ""dangerous"" territory.

""The damage to the reef is a very clear indicator of the harm our greenhouse gas emissions are doing to the planet,"" King said. 

""Hopefully this severe bleaching will help to trigger action so that we can curb our emissions.""

A strong El Niño climate event, combined with the impact of global warming and other factors, has prompted unusually warm ocean temperatures and the world's third-ever global coral bleaching event, which began in 2014 and is expected to continue until 2017. 

The bleaching seen in the Coral Sea is part of this event.

Heidi Cullen, the chief scientist for Climate Central in New Jersey who leads a consortium of researchers who conduct extreme event attribution studies, told Mashable that this new analysis ""makes clear the heavy toll of burning fossil fuels."" 

""It is the ultimate alarm bell that we need to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions right away,"" she said. 

Cullen was not involved in the new study.

The projection that much of the Great Barrier Reef could perish within the next few decades could turn out to be too pessimistic, since other research has shown that some species of corals are surprisingly resilient to the stress from changing ocean temperatures.

In a press release on March 29, the Australian Coral Bleaching Task Force announced that the northern portions of the Great Barrier Reef are in the throes of the most intense coral bleaching event on record there.

The Task Force, comprised of 10 Australian research institutions, made its determination after completing aerial surveys of more than 500 coral reefs from Cairns north to Papua New Guinea.

“This has been the saddest research trip of my life,” says Prof. Terry Hughes, convener of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, said in a press release.

“Almost without exception, every reef we flew across showed consistently high levels of bleaching, from the reef slope right up onto the top of the reef,"" Hughes said.

""We flew for 4,000 kilometers in the most pristine parts of the Great Barrier Reef, and saw only four reefs that had no bleaching. The severity is much greater than in earlier bleaching events in 2002 or 1998.”

The ongoing global bleaching event is the longest-lasting one ever observed, and only the third ever seen. It has occurred during the warmest year on record, which occurred in 2015, and the two most unusually mild months on Earth, which took place in January and February, respectively.

“This has been the saddest research trip of my life”

It is due to record warm ocean temperatures around the world, partly driven by a strong El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean.",high,Accurate,109,"This Mashable article reports on preliminary research that finds that the ongoing coral bleaching event in the Pacific is mainly due to human-caused global warming, and that if global warming proceeds as currently expected, “large parts” of the Great Barrier Reef could die by the mid-2030s.

Six scientists have reviewed the article and conclude that overall it is accurate and in agreement with the science. The title, however, was pointed out to be somewhat exaggerated. Scientists expect that coral reefs may perish by the 2030s, yet the “Great Barrier Reef” is an ecosystem of many different species that are variously resilient to climate change. To be clear, catastrophic impacts are predicted for coral reefs, but this does not necessarily mean the entire Great Barrier Reef will be devastated.

","The article reflects the current state of knowledge in this area. While it may sound alarming (even alarmist) that the world’s most biologically diverse marine ecosystem may be largely eliminated over the next 20-30 years, this is the conclusion and scientific consensus to be found in Chapter 30 and other places of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC). It is also the consensus conclusion of the major scientific bodies and science community that study coral reefs (e.g. International Society for Reef Studies report).

","The article focuses solely on increasing ocean temperatures whereas the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is currently threatened by multiple pressures – however, none of the other pressures are mentioned. It builds on the erroneous headline that “..93% of the GBR has already been devastated by bleaching” – whereas the media release from the ARC Centre for Coral Reef Studies explained why this was not a true summation of the recent bleaching situation. This article also gives readers the (false) impression that the entire Great Barrier Reef will be devastated within decades; whereas the article should have clarified it was referring to the coral reefs which, whilst a critical part of the GBR, comprise around 10% of the entire area.

It is clear that if we do not curtail emissions dramatically and soon, coral reefs around the world will be gone.

","I would like to add to Ken’s point here. We are already – and have been for some time – into dangerous climate change when it comes to coral reefs and hundreds of millions of people that depend on them. The first global mass coral bleaching (NB: reef scale and regional coral bleaching has been reported since the early 1980s and not before) occurred in 1998 and saw the death of an estimated 16% of reef building corals from across the planet (which sounds small until you appreciate that this is a global average!). While it is too early to speculate at this point, the fact that we now have much warmer seas underpinning the current global disturbance to temperature patterns (plus the much more severe event in Australia) suggests that we will have a much greater mortality at the end of 2016 than what we saw in 1998.

",,,"“The analysis’ findings dovetail with other research that has predicted the mass die-off of coral reefs around the planet by the year 2050, as waters warm and exceed the tolerance level of many coral reef systems.”

","This is true. This statement refers to the study I published in 1999 (Climate change, coral bleaching and the future of the world’s coral reefs) which brought climate projections together with the known tolerances of reef building corals and specifically proposed that the conditions that cause serious bleaching today would occur every 1-2 years by 2040-2050.[…]

The important point here is that anything more frequent than 10-15 years in terms of mass coral bleaching events will overwhelm regeneration, which normally takes this long to occur. That is, coral reefs go downhill well before bleaching conditions become as frequent as every 1-2 years.

",,,,"“a new study by scientists at the Australian Research Council finds that the ongoing bleaching event is mainly due to human-caused global warming, and that if global warming proceeds as currently expected, “large parts” of the Great Barrier Reef could die by the mid-2030s.”

","We published a paper some years ago projecting that by mid-century, no coral reefs would be sustainable (Silverman et al 2009: Coral reefs may start dissolving when atmospheric CO2 doubles). It is thus not surprising to see the failure of large areas of reef before that date.

",,,,“Great Barrier Reef may perish by 2030s”,This word ‘may’ is obviously key. The question is: what is the likelihood.,,,,"“The ongoing global bleaching event is the longest-lasting one ever observed, and only the third ever seen. It has occurred during the warmest year on record, which occurred in 2015, and the two most unusually mild months on Earth, which took place in January and February, respectively.”","It should be emphasized to the readers that mass coral bleaching first turns up in scientific records in the early 1980s – with no reports prior to that. Over time, mass coral bleaching and mortality has expanded in frequency and severity, with three truly global events being recorded so far – 1998, 2010, and 2016. The apparent shortening of the interval between global events is of great concern and suggests that anything we can do now to avoid further increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will save very substantial amounts in lost income and livelihoods from subsistence as well as industries such as fishing and tourism. This is an issue of food security – the effects of which are already occurring and which are growing more serious by the day.

",,,,"“Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is one of the world’s greatest reservoirs of biodiversity.  A World Heritage site, it is currently under assault from unusually hot ocean temperatures,”

","The 2014 Outlook Report published by Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the agency responsible for managing the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), clarifies that the GBR is currently faced with many pressures, of which climate change is only one. Poor water quality from land-based runoff, damage from cyclones, ocean acidification, Crown-of-Thorns starfish, dumping of dredge spoil, etc, are among a multitude of pressures which are cumulatively impacting on the GBR, and particularly upon coral reefs.

","Note that there is also a possibility that ocean acidification is contributing stress to coral reef systems, making them more susceptible to bleaching from high seawater temperatures.

In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Bjorn Lomborg criticizes the report as unbalanced. Ten scientists analyzed the article and found that Lomborg had reached his conclusions through cherry-picking from a small subset of the evidence, misrepresenting the results of existing studies, and relying on flawed reasoning.

",,,,,"Aaron Bernstein, Associate Director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment, Boston Children’s Hospital, Harvard
","Children’s Hospital, Harvard:
While it’s true that cold may kill more people today than heat, Lomborg’s assertion that climate change will result in fewer overall deaths in the U.S. this century from extreme temperatures is not supported by available evidence. The citations in the report, which Lomborg himself dismisses, substantiate this claim e.g. Mills, David, et al. “Climate change impacts on extreme temperature mortality in select metropolitan areas in the United States” in Climatic Change.

Lomborg largely conflates U.S. with global assessments. His logic, from a public health perspective, is also deeply troubling and fails, at first pass, the maxim of “first do no harm”. Beyond this, adaptive capacity to climate extremes is no easy feat and as several past extreme heat events have shown, such as the European heatwaves of 2003 or 2010, the consequences reverberate beyond mortality in those directly exposed. Heatwaves promote wildfires, crop losses, food price spikes and conflicts.
","Antonio Gasparrini, Senior Lecturer, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
","My review is limited to the part of the article that describes the results of the study published in The Lancet, which I first-authored.

The interpretation provided in the article is misleading, as our study is meant to provide evidence on past/current relationships between temperature and health, and not to assess changes in the future. In addition, the study does not offer a global assessment, and it is limited to a set of countries not representative of the global population.

","Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University
","Bjorn Lomborg disputes the notion, presented in a recent national assessment report, that global warming will increase the number of temperature-related deaths in the US. To do so, he carefully picks studies and uses flawed reasoning.

Instances of faulty reasoning include Lomborg’s interpretations of  the facts that i) cold-related deaths currently outnumber heat-related ones and ii) migration patterns in the last decades indicate that people are generally moving to the warmer, Southern part of the US. However, i) does not imply that warmer temperatures will reduce deaths: what matters is the sensitivity of the death-risk to a change in temperature, and that appears to be higher for heat than for cold; as for ii), migration patterns are not driven only by climate, and probably account for future climate change even less so.

While Mr. Lomborg’s single focus on deaths directly related to temperature could imply that it is the only thing that matters, it clouds out (whether on purpose or not) all the other impacts expected from global warming: impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, water resources, sea level rise, etc. Those other impacts are also expected to have detrimental effects, if not directly on the lives or deaths of Americans, at least on their welfare and on America’s prosperity.

","Stephan Lewandowsky, Professor, University of Bristol
","Mr Lomborg points to a skewed and highly selective sample of the literature and ignores many other well-established findings that would undermine his argument. For example, the article ignores the recent finding that economic productivity declines with increasing temperatures past a fairly cool inflection point, and that this relationship remains unchanged even after considerable time for adaptation has elapsed. The article also ignores the adverse effects of climate change on agricultural production; the demonstrable relationship between heat and migration; the association between heat and interpersonal violence at all scales; the fact that unmitigated climate change will eventually make parts of the planet uninhabitable due to the increase of temperatures beyond the life-threatening threshold of 35C (wet bulb temperature, not dry temperature). Bizarrely, for an article concerned with the health effects of climate change, Mr Lomborg also fails to mention the demonstrable health benefits that are associated with cutting carbon emissions due to a reduction in pollution-related mortality. Unfortunately, therefore, the article fails to inform but instead misleads the readership by an extremely selective reporting of the literature.

","Steven Sherwood, Professor, University of New South Wales
","The article raises legitimate issues but its key point that cold kills more people than heat is misleading, because heat deaths will skyrocket once global temperature has risen significantly while the benefits on the cold side will decline. Indeed there is a strict limit to human tolerance of heat and humidity, that may be approached in some regions within a century and would cause severe stresses.

","Philip Staddon, Lecturer/Visiting Scholar, The Open University, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University
","Lomborg is using scientific ‘language’ to suggest that climate change will have insignificant health impacts; this goes against a vast body of evidence. The notion that benefits from warmer winters could be more important than risks from hotter summers in terms of human health is plain wrong.

For once, the US administration is taking health impacts of climate change seriously, and it is particularly unhelpful to attempt to confuse the public on this issue.

","David Mills, Managing Analyst, Stratus Consulting
","The article claims the new U.S. Global Change report overlooks the evidence about the relative significance of mortality attributed to cold (and the cold season) relative to heat (and the hot season) while in reality, it is included (see Sections 2.5 and 2.6). Similarly, Lomborg uses selective representation of published literature and puts the emphasis on studies outside the U.S., while the new report specifically notes it focuses on reviewing U.S. based studies.

For the interested reader, here is an insightful discussion on the topic of how climate change threatens U.S. population’s health.

","Michael Brauer, Professor, The University of British Columbia
","The article is selective in its interpretation of the temperature-mortality relationship. It is correct that both cold and warm temperatures kill and that, at present, cold kills more than heat but that does not imply that future warming will lead to fewer cold-related deaths than any increase in heat-related deaths, these relationships are complex and non-linear. It also discusses one part only of a comprehensive assessment to argue that the whole assessment is incorrect/invalid. This is biased.

",,,,,,,"“Higher temperatures, we’re told, will be deadly—killing “thousands to tens of thousands” of Americans”

","Whether this is on purpose or not, Mr. Lomborg’s immediate focus on the part of the report dealing with temperature-related deaths makes it sound as if this is the only focus of the report. However, the report also deals with air quality impacts, food safety, extreme events, etc.

",,,,"“cold kills many more people than heat.”“We’re putting carbon into the atmosphere at an even faster rate than happened back then.”We are now exceeding by an order of magnitude the rate of carbon release during one of the most remarkable global warming events in Earth’s history.
","Mr. Lomborg is confusing seasonal mortality with temperature-related mortality. It is true that mortality is higher during winter than summer. However, it does not follow that winter mortality is temperature-dependent (which summer mortality is). Dave Mills and I reviewed the evidence and concluded that only a small proportion of winter mortality is likely associated with temperature. A growing numbers of publications are exploring associations between weather and winter mortality, with differences in methods and results. The country with the strongest association between winter mortality and temperature is England, which appears in other publications to be at least partly due to cold housing. Winter mortality is lower in northern European countries.

","This is cherry picking – even if it were true. Climate change is much more than just temperature. It also affects precipitation and the lack thereof – with consequences such as floods, mud slides, droughts, and wildfires.

Furthermore, the cold is fairly limited to the high northern latitudes, … and not so many live there, but many more in the warm tropics… These rich countries also have the means to collect statistics. The poor developing countries often lack credible statistics, and I do not believe for a second that we have an estimate of all people who die from heat stress in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

","Lomborg seems unaware of, or more likely is ignoring, the fact that climate change caused by human activities is making the climate not only warmer but more unpredictable: increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events including drought, heavy downpours, heat waves…

",,"“In pushing too hard for the case that global warming is universally bad for everything, the administration’s report undermines the reasonable case for climate action.”

","As seems to always be the case with Lomborg (cf his previous WSJ’s article reviewed by Climate Feedback), he picks up a few studies that support his position.

Note, first, that the report’s claim about projected heat-related deaths outweighing cold ones applies to the US: different regions might have different responses…

Second, when reviewing the literature on the topic, the IPCC report indicates (WGIIAR5-Chap11, p.721): “it is not clear whether winter mortality will decrease in a warmer, but more variable, climate (Kinney et al., 2012; Ebi and Mills, 2013). Overall, we conclude that the increase in heat-related mortality by mid-century will outweigh gains due to fewer cold periods, especially in tropical developing countries with limited adaptive capacities and large exposed populations”

So the US report does not appear wildly at odds with the literature on the topic, or to be “pushing too hard”. Also, it does not say that warming is universally bad, just that the bad outweighs the good on this particular topic.",,,,"“…climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.”

","The assertion that warmer winters = less mortality is a schoolboy error. Indeed everyone knows that European countries with warmer climates and milder winters actually have MORE not LESS winter mortality; principally due to adaptation.

The current numbers of winter mortality may well be higher than summer heat wave mortality in many temperate to northern countries, however what is crucially important is that evidence points to significant increase in summer heat related mortality and no or very little change to winter mortality as a result of climate change.

","A recent paper by Kinney et al. (Winter season mortality: will climate warming bring benefits?) suggests that reductions in cold-related mortality under warming climate may be much smaller than some have assumed. Kinney and colleagues analyzed excess winter mortality across multiple cities and over multiple years within individual cities. They found that excess winter mortality was no lower in warmer vs. colder cities, suggesting that temperature is not a key driver of winter excess mortality. In addition, variability in daily mortality within cities was not strongly influenced by winter temperature.

","There is very limited scientific support for the claim that reducing the number of cold days (by which he apparently means winter) will reduce the number of cold-related deaths. Again, this is assuming winter mortality is temperature-dependent; an assumption not verified by research in the US and elsewhere.

",,"“The administration’s new report refers to this study … but only in trivial ways, such as to establish the relationship between temperature and mortality.”","As previously noted, [our] study contributes evidence only to ‘direct’ effects of temperature on human health. As a matter of fact, this is likely to represent a minor part of the total excess mortality and morbidity due to a changing climate.",,,,"“Not once does this “scientific assessment” acknowledge that cold deaths significantly outweigh heat deaths.”

","Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University:
That’s not true. Under section 2.5, the report indicates:

“A recent analysis of U.S. deaths from temperature extremes based on death records found an average of approximately 1,300 deaths per year from 2006 to 2010 coded as resulting from extreme cold exposures, and 670 deaths per year coded as resulting from exposure to extreme heat. These results, and those from all similar studies that rely solely on coding within medical records to determine cause of deaths, will underestimate the actual number of deaths due to extreme temperatures.”

And then further down (my emphasis): “studies based on statistical approaches have found that, despite a larger number of deaths being coded as related to extreme cold rather than extreme heat, and a larger mortality rate in winter overall, the relationship between mortality and an additional day of extreme heat is generally much larger than the relationship between mortality and an additional day of extreme cold.”",,,,“Consider a rigorous study published last year in the journal Lancet that examined temperature-related mortality around the globe.”,"As the first author of this article, I deem it is worth pointing out that the aim of this study is to establish the association between non-optimal temperature and mortality (in terms of excess deaths) in the recent past, using historical data. The article clearly acknowledges that these results cannot be easily extrapolated to the future, in particular under climate change scenarios, for a series of reasons detailed in the discussion section of the article. For instance, the change in heat and cold-related deaths will depend on changes in future temperature distribution, which is likely to be more complex than a simple upward shift.

",,,,"“The report confidently claims that when temperatures rise, “the reduction in premature deaths from cold are expected to be smaller than the increase in deaths from heat in the United States.” Six footnotes are attached to that statement.”","The report says “The decrease in deaths and illness due to reductions in winter cold have not been as well studied as the health impacts of increased heat, but the reduction in premature deaths from cold are expected to be smaller than the increase in deaths from heat in the United States“. This doesn’t sound over-confident to me; and as for the “footnotes”, there are scientific references to back up that claim, not asterisks leading to fine-print caveats…

",,,,"“In the U.S. about 9,000 people die from heat each year but 144,000 die from cold.”

","These numbers are not deaths reported as clinically due to heat or cold. It seems Lomborg computed them from the Lancet study, using percentages given by the study, times the total number of deaths.

","Where do these numbers come from? According to a review of national health statistics:

During 2006–2010, about 2,000 U.S. residents died each year from weather-related causes. About 31% of these deaths were attributed to exposure to excessive natural heat, heat stroke, sun stroke, or all; 63% were attributed to exposure to excessive natural cold, hypothermia, or both; and the remaining 6% were attributed to floods, storms, or lightning.

This statement also confuses seasonal mortality with mortality from extreme events. As noted in Ebi and Mills, this distinction is important for understanding what could happen with climate change.

","In the UK for example, the evidence now shows NO strong link between how cold a winter is and how many deaths occur. Sure the link was very strong up until the 1970s, but Lomborg might be aware that since the 1950s there have been massive improvements in building, heating, aid to the poorest, healthcare. How winter temperatures affected mortality in the 50s is no longer relevant.

The key driver for annual variation in winter mortality in rich countries now appears to be incidence and virulence of influenza and similar diseases.

","As previously noted, the study published in The Lancet contributes little to understanding how these figures will change in the future under scenarios of climate change. In particular, it is difficult to ascertain from these results if the supposed decrease in cold-related deaths will offset the supposed increase in heat-related mortality.
",“cold deaths actually occur during moderate temperatures”,"This suggests that the dependency is not linear, and there is a multitude of factors involved. Hence, “cold deaths” may be a misnomer. The temperature is a moderator combined with standard of living, life-style diseases, pollution, and poverty, in addition to accidents and other weather conditions…

",,,,"“The Lancet researchers found that about 0.5%—half a percent—of all deaths are associated with heat, not only from acute problems like heat stroke, but also increased mortality from cardiac events and dehydration. But more than 7% of deaths are related to cold—counting hypothermia, as well as increased blood pressure and risk of heart attack that results when the body restricts blood flow in response to frigid temperatures.”","I do not want to question the quality of this particular study, but it’s worth looking at how they get such numbers.

First, this is a statistical study where they look at data on numbers of deaths and temperatures in various locations: of course, nothing says if, or how, these deaths are really related to temperature (heat or cold). This is an empirical study. Lomborg’s comments suggest that the authors of this study are counting deaths explicitly caused by heat or cold, but this is not the case.

Second, they basically fit a temperature-death risk response curve to this data. They then see for what temperature the mortality risk is lowest – and then they aggregate all the deaths below (for cold-related deaths) and above (for heat-related ones) that temperature. Because the temperature of minimum mortality is often high (around 20-25C, or lower 70’s F), for cold-related deaths this leads to integrating the response function (even with low death risks) over much of the temperature distribution. See plots below. The authors indicate as much: “This difference was mainly caused by the high minimum-mortality percentile, with most of the mean daily temperatures being lower than the optimum value.” This methodology also explains why most cold-related deaths appear due to “moderate cold”.

This is worth explaining, because I am not sure dying in 15C weather (60F) in Rome or Sydney is really what people will understand when they read about “cold-related deaths”!

The other thing that is easy to see is that the risk curve generally increases slowly towards cold temperature, but a lot more steeply past high temperatures. So even if one agrees with how this study classifies and counts “cold deaths”, the fact that they outnumber heat deaths, in absolute numbers, does not necessarily mean that increasing temperatures will reduce deaths: based on these plots, it could well be that warming will reduce cold-related deaths less than it increases heat-related ones. And indeed, this is what the studies about future projection of temperature-related deaths that they cite, and that Lomborg discusses, do find.

",,,,"“Consider where they move. Migration patterns show people heading for warm states like Texas and Florida, not snowy Minnesota and Michigan.”

","This focuses on average climate rather than on extremes, and such patterns of migration are based on our knowledge of the past. As the frequency of extreme hot days increases, as the number of extreme hurricanes increases, and as sea levels rise, people may find that Florida is not so attractive after all.

","People don’t like the cold, they like sunshine and warmth, and (supposedly as a result, according to Lomborg), they move to the South: does Lomborg really want us to deduce from that that global warming will thus be good for us – even simply in terms of temperature-related deaths?

That’s not reasonable.

First, while people have indeed generally been moving from the North(-East) to the South over the last decades, it’s not only because of “better climate”: quoting this article by the Washington Post, “Several long-term trends dating as far back as the 1960s are behind this larger pattern. The rise of air conditioning and interstate highways have made once-sleepy (and sweltering) Southern cities more appealing. And, over the same time, the decline of industrial jobs in the Midwest and Northeast have pushed people out. Cheap housing during the boom years also drove growth in states such as Arizona and Nevada“. I think that is already much more reasonable than saying that people move South only because they know they are less likely to die from cold exposure there.

Second, people may be moving there right now partly because of climate, and that may indeed be a “smart” move because, TODAY, indeed, current cold-related deaths outnumber heat-related deaths. However, even supposing that this is a significant factor in their decision process, it’s not clear that they are also thinking about future warming. So the fact that people are moving there NOW does not even logically imply, as Lomborg would have it, that FUTURE warming will be beneficial – which is the point of interest here.

","This has more to do with economic factors than weather. If people moved only because of poor weather, why hasn’t everyone left Northern Europe?

And then you get scared.

This is a time period, about 56 million years ago, when something mysterious happened — there are many ideas as to what — that suddenly caused concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to spike, far higher than they are right now. The planet proceeded to warm rapidly, at least in geologic terms, and major die-offs of some marine organisms followed due to strong acidification of the oceans.

The cause of the PETM has been widely debated. Some think it was an explosion of carbon from thawing Arctic permafrost. Some think there was a huge release of subsea methane that somehow made its way to the atmosphere — and that the series of events might have been kickstarted by major volcanic eruptions.

In any case, the result was a hothouse world from pole to pole, some 5 degrees Celsius warmer overall. But now, new research suggests, even the drama of the PETM falls short of our current period, in at least one key respect: We’re putting carbon into the atmosphere at an even faster rate than happened back then.

Such is the result of a new study in Nature Geoscience, led by Richard Zeebe of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and colleagues from the University of Bristol in the UK and the University of California-Riverside.

“If you look over the entire Cenozoic, the last 66 million years, the only event that we know of at the moment, that has a massive carbon release, and happens over a relatively short period of time, is the PETM,” says Zeebe. “We actually have to go back to relatively old periods, because in the more recent past, we don’t see anything comparable to what humans are currently doing.”

That’s why this time period is so crucial to study — as a possible window on our own.

There’s no doubt that a lot of carbon — about as much as contained the fossil fuel reserves that humans have either already burned, or could still burn, combined — made its way into the atmosphere during the PETM. The result was a major warming event that lasted over 100,000 years. But precisely how rapidly the emissions occurred is another matter.

“If anthropogenic emissions rates have no analogue in Earth’s recent history, then unforeseeable future responses of the climate system are possible,” the authors write.

To examine what happened in the PETM, the researchers used a deep ocean core of sediment from off the coast of New Jersey. The goal was to determine the ratios between different isotopes, or slightly different elemental forms, of carbon and oxygen, in the sediments during the PETM.

The relationship between the two lets researchers determine how atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, as reflected in the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13, in turn influenced temperatures (which can be inferred based on oxygen isotopes in the ocean).

“In terms of these two systems, the first shows us when the carbon went into the system, and the second tells us when the climate responded,” says Zeebe.

It turns out that there is a lag time between massive pulses of carbon in the atmosphere and subsequent warming, because the oceans have a large thermal inertia. Therefore, a large lag would indicate a greater carbon release, whereas the lack of one actually means that carbon dioxide came out more slowly.

The geologic evidence from the new core did not show a lag, the new study reports. That means, the authors estimate, that while a gigantic volume of carbon entered the atmosphere during the PETM — between 2,000 and 4,500 billion tons — it played out over some 4,000 years. So only about 1 billion tons of carbon were emitted per year. In contrast, humans are now emitting about 10 billion tons annually — changing the planet much more rapidly.

“The anthropogenic release outpaces carbon release during the most extreme global warming event of the past 66 million years, by at least an order of magnitude,” writes Peter Stassen, an Earth and environmental scientist at KU Leuven, in Belgium, in an accompanying commentary on the new study.

The analogy between the PETM and the present, then, is less than perfect — and our own era may be worse in key ways. “The two main conclusions is that ocean acidification will be more severe, ecosystems may be hit harder because of the rate” of carbon release, says Zeebe.

And not only have we only begun to see the changes that will result from current warming, but there may be other changes that lack any ancient parallel, because of the current rate of change.

“Given that the current rate of carbon release is unprecedented throughout the Cenozoic, we have effectively entered an era of a no-analogue state, which represents a fundamental challenge to constraining future climate projections,” the study concludes.","high, very_high","Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",124,"Chris Mooney reports on a new scientific study that shows the current rate of increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is unprecedented in the record of the last 66 million years.

coral reef

An “inherent bias” in scientific journals in favour of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification, which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

It has been dubbed the “evil twin of climate change” and hundreds of studies have claimed to show that it destroys coral reefs and other marine life by making it harder for them to develop shells or skeletons.

The review found that many studies had used flawed methods, subjecting marine creatures to sudden increases in carbon dioxide that would never be experienced in real life.

“In some cases it was levels far beyond what would ever be reached even if we burnt every molecule of carbon on the planet,” Howard Browman, the editor of ICES Journal of Marine Science, who oversaw the review, said. He added that this had distracted attention from more urgent threats to reefs such as agricultural pollution, overfishing and tourism.

Dr Browman, who is also principal research scientist at the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research, found there had been huge increase in articles on ocean acidification in recent years, rising from five in 2005 to 600 last year.

He said that a handful of influential scientific journals and lobbying by international organisations had turned ocean acidification into a major issue.

“Such journals tend to publish doom and gloom stories . . . stated without equivocation,” he said. The bias in favour of doom-laden articles was partly the result of pressure on scientists to produce eye-catching work, he added. […]

Dr Browman, a marine scientist for 35 years, said he was not saying that ocean acidification posed no threat, but that he believed that “a higher level of academic scepticism” should be applied to the topic.",very_low,"Biased, Cherry-picking, Misleading",140,"Ben Webster reports that the threat posed by ocean acidification to marine life is “exaggerated”.

The article is not representative of the state of scientific knowledge.

","The Times article is not representative of the message that I tried to give the journalist during the interview – that is, the message presented my introduction to the special issue in which I state clearly and explicitly that ocean acidification IS happening and WILL have effects. After reading my introduction, and the articles in the special issue, readers can come to their their own conclusion about whether the journalist worked carefully, conscientiously and impartially to help me accurately spread its messages.

I spoke with Ben Webster of The Times in a 30-minute phone call and explained that the objective of the special issue he was reporting on was to introduce more balance into the topic of Ocean Acidification. He cherry-picked our conversation and presented phrases out of context – seemingly in order to be sensational – despite the fact that I told him that the press was part of the “exaggeration” problem. For example, the quoted phrase “inherent bias” in the first paragraph is not the same as the “publication bias” that I refer to in my introduction. Further, my introduction does not say that the existing literature is “exaggerating” the effects of ocean acidification, but that more careful interpretation is required. Finally, I am not saying that the special issue overturns previous literature on the topic, as the Times suggests, but that they should be taken together, in balance. Very disappointing.

This claim about a misnomer is based on a misunderstanding of how words are used.,,,,"“The oceans will never become acid because there is such a huge buffering capacity in the oceans. We simply could never release enough CO2 into the atmosphere to cause the pH to go below 7 [the point in the pH scale at which a solution becomes acidic].”

“The worsening of tidal flooding in American coastal communities is largely a consequence of greenhouse gases from human activity, and the problem will grow far worse in coming decades, scientists reported Monday.”

","This statement sets up a false notion about the pH balance of the oceans. In fact, the global ocean is, on weighted average, very close to (but just above) 7, which is controlled by many factors including atmospheric CO2 changes, but most importantly by the buffering from carbonate-rich sediments. This buffering timescale is slow, such that there can in fact be a decoupling of ocean pH from the main buffering capacity of seawater (see Honisch et al, Science, 2012 The Geological Record of Ocean Acidification). This statement also fails to acknowledge the thermodynamic threshold to skeleton-building (saturation state), which for corals and many other organisms falls well above pH 7.

But I believe that it is far from being as bad as the article suggests. The most recent and comprehensive meta-analysis of the impact of ocean acidification shows that many processes and taxonomic groups exhibit no statistically significant response (Kroeker et al., 2013). This demonstrates that many non-calamitous papers are published.

That is a bias that is inherent in all of modern science and is not specific to ocean acidification research.

","This is an inflammatory twisting of the author’s words. Browman discusses the well-known bias against publication of negative results. It has nothing to do with the direction of the signal, only the inability of the researchers to demonstrate an effect in their experiments.

If Dr Browman wants to attack particular studies, he should cite particular statements from particular papers that he thinks are false. It is inappropriate to make vague accusations denigrating an entire field of inquiry.

","There is a degree to which scientific skepticism should be applied to Ocean Acidification experiments. There are many “cook and look” type experiments that investigate short term, single-species effects which are often not representative of the real world, include no mechanistic or physiological explanation, and lack any sort of adaptive response from the organism itself. However, the field as a whole is moving away from this approach, thanks to the hard work of many ecologists, biologists, chemists, and oceanographers working together, generating data, and participating in the scientific method.

Analysis of “Seas Are Rising at Fastest Rate in Last 28 Centuries”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/sea-level-rise-global-warming-climate-change/,Seas Are Rising at Fastest Rate in Last 28 Centuries,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/science/sea-level-rise-global-warming-climate-change.html,"The worsening of tidal flooding in American coastal communities is largely a consequence of greenhouse gases from human activity, and the problem will grow far worse in coming decades, scientists reported Monday.

Those emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, are causing the ocean to rise at the fastest rate since at least the founding of ancient Rome, the scientists said. They added that in the absence of human emissions, the ocean surface would be rising less rapidly and might even be falling.

The increasingly routine tidal flooding is making life miserable in places like Miami Beach; Charleston, S.C.; and Norfolk, Va., even on sunny days.

Though these types of floods often produce only a foot or two of standing saltwater, they are straining life in many towns by killing lawns and trees, blocking neighborhood streets and clogging storm drains, polluting supplies of freshwater and sometimes stranding entire island communities for hours by overtopping the roads that tie them to the mainland.

Such events are just an early harbinger of the coming damage, the new research suggests.

“I think we need a new way to think about most coastal flooding,” said Benjamin H. Strauss, the primary author of one of two related studies released on Monday. “It’s not the tide. It’s not the wind. It’s us. That’s true for most of the coastal floods we now experience.”

In the second study, scientists reconstructed the level of the sea over time and confirmed that it is most likely rising faster than at any point in 28 centuries, with the rate of increase growing sharply over the past century — largely, they found, because of the warming that scientists have said is almost certainly caused by human emissions.

They also confirmed previous forecasts that if emissions were to continue at a high rate over the next few decades, the ocean could rise as much as three or four feet by 2100.

Experts say the situation would then grow far worse in the 22nd century and beyond, likely requiring the abandonment of many coastal cities.

The findings are yet another indication that the stable climate in which human civilization has flourished for thousands of years, with a largely predictable ocean permitting the growth of great coastal cities, is coming to an end.

“I think we can definitely be confident that sea-level rise is going to continue to accelerate if there’s further warming, which inevitably there will be,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, a professor of ocean physics at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in Germany, and co-author of one of the papers, published online Monday by an American journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

In a report issued to accompany that scientific paper, a climate research and communications organization in Princeton, N.J., Climate Central, used the new findings to calculate that roughly three-quarters of the tidal flood days now occurring in towns along the East Coast would not be happening in the absence of the rise in the sea level caused by human emissions.

The lead author of that report, Dr. Strauss, said the same was likely true on a global scale, in any coastal community that has had an increase of saltwater flooding in recent decades.

The rise in the sea level contributes only in a limited degree to the huge, disastrous storm surges accompanying hurricanes like Katrina and Sandy. Proportionally, it has a bigger effect on the nuisance floods that can accompany what are known as king tides.

The change in frequency of those tides is striking. For instance, in the decade from 1955 to 1964 at Annapolis, Md., an instrument called a tide gauge measured 32 days of flooding; in the decade from 2005 to 2014, that jumped to 394 days.

Flood days in Charleston jumped from 34 in the earlier decade to 219 in the more recent, and in Key West, Fla., the figure jumped from no flood days in the earlier decade to 32 in the more recent.

The new research was led by Robert E. Kopp, an earth scientist at Rutgers University who has won respect from his colleagues by bringing elaborate statistical techniques to bear on longstanding problems, like understanding the history of the global sea level.

Based on extensive geological evidence, scientists already knew that the sea level rose drastically at the end of the last ice age, by almost 400 feet, causing shorelines to retreat up to a hundred miles in places. They also knew that the sea level had basically stabilized, like the rest of the climate, over the past several thousand years, the period when human civilization arose.

But there were small variations of climate and sea level over that period, and the new paper is the most exhaustive attempt yet to clarify them.

The paper shows the ocean to be extremely sensitive to small fluctuations in the Earth’s temperature. The researchers found that when the average global temperature fell by a third of a degree Fahrenheit in the Middle Ages, for instance, the surface of the ocean dropped by about three inches in 400 years. When the climate warmed slightly, that trend reversed.

“Physics tells us that sea-level change and temperature change should go hand-in-hand,” Dr. Kopp said. “This new geological record confirms it.”

In the 19th century, as the Industrial Revolution took hold, the ocean began to rise briskly, climbing about eight inches since 1880. That sounds small, but it has caused extensive erosion worldwide, costing billions.

Due largely to human emissions, global temperatures have jumped about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit since the 19th century. The sea is rising at what appears to be an accelerating pace, lately reaching a rate of about a foot per century.

One of the authors of the new paper, Dr. Rahmstorf, had previously published estimates suggesting the sea could rise as much as five or six feet by 2100. But with the improved calculations from the new paper, his latest upper estimate is three to four feet.

That means Dr. Rahmstorf’s forecast is now more consistent with calculations issued in 2013 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations body that periodically reviews and summarizes climate research. That body found that continued high emissions might produce a rise in the sea of 1.7 to 3.2 feet over the 21st century.

In an interview, Dr. Rahmstorf said the rise would eventually reach five feet and far more — the only question was how long it would take. Scientists say the recent climate agreement negotiated in Paris is not remotely ambitious enough to forestall a significant melting of Greenland and Antarctica, though if fully implemented, it may slow the pace somewhat.

“Ice simply melts faster when the temperatures get higher,” Dr. Rahmstorf said. “That’s just basic physics.”","high, very_high","Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",1097,"Justin Gillis reports on new results showing that the current rate of sea level rise is unprecedented in a record dating back 2,000 years.

Analysis of “The Climate Snow Job”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/patrick-michaels-the-climate-snow-job-the-wall-street-journal/,The Climate Snow Job,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-climate-snow-job-1453664732,"An East Coast blizzard howling, global temperatures peaking, the desert Southwest flooding, drought-stricken California drying up—surely there’s a common thread tying together this “extreme” weather. There is. But it has little to do with what recent headlines have been saying about the hottest year ever. It is called business as usual.

Surface temperatures are indeed increasing slightly: They’ve been going up, in fits and starts, for more than 150 years, or since a miserably cold and pestilential period known as the Little Ice Age. Before carbon dioxide from economic activity could have warmed us up, temperatures rose three-quarters of a degree Fahrenheit between 1910 and World War II. They then cooled down a bit, only to warm again from the mid-1970s to the late ’90s, about the same amount as earlier in the century.

Whether temperatures have warmed much since then depends on what you look at. Until last June, most scientists acknowledged that warming reached a peak in the late 1990s, and since then had plateaued in a “hiatus.” There are about 60 different explanations for this in the refereed literature.

That changed last summer, when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) decided to overhaul its data, throwing out satellite-sensed sea-surface temperatures since the late 1970s and instead relying on, among other sources, readings taken from the cooling-water-intake tubes of oceangoing vessels. The scientific literature is replete with articles about the large measurement errors that accrue in this data owing to the fact that a ship’s infrastructure conducts heat, absorbs a tremendous amount of the sun’s energy, and vessels’ intake tubes are at different ocean depths. See, for instance, John J. Kennedy’s “A review of uncertainty in in situ measurements and data sets of sea surface temperature,” published Jan. 24, 2014, by the journal Reviews of Geophysics.

NOAA’s alteration of its measurement standard and other changes produced a result that could have been predicted: a marginally significant warming trend in the data over the past several years, erasing the temperature plateau that vexed climate alarmists have found difficult to explain. Yet the increase remains far below what had been expected.","low, very_low","Biased, Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",542,"The article misleads readers with a series of sweeping claims about distinct aspects of climate science and the implications of global warming for the global economy. Most of the article is devoted to casting doubt over the accuracy of the global temperature record. The author uses detailed technical descriptions to distract readers from the inaccuracies of the article, which involve cherry-picking data to support multiple unsubstantiated and discredited claims.

","This is a simple, deliberate, and misleading conflation of (natural) El Niño variability and (anthropogenic) global warming trend to suggest that 2015 warmth is soley related to El Niño variability. It is very easy to debunk Michael’s suggestion that 2015 warmth is due only to El Niño, as shown by the other reviewers. The weather-related reinsurance risk statement itself is plain false (just read the MunichRe corporate statements), as is the statement that “Without El Niño, temperatures in 2015 would have been typical of the post-1998 regime“.

","This article is indeed a snow job, as the title implies. The author has twisted the facts and distorted the science wildly. The author is well known for his wildly inaccurate climate “forecasts”, see e.g. Patrick Michaels: Cato’s Climate Expert Has History Of Getting It Wrong

",,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Surface temperatures are indeed increasing slightly: They’ve been going up, in fits and starts”

","There are also other reasons why the global mean temperature changes from one year to the next, such as volcanoes and El Niño. You see these changes on top of the long-term trend due to increases in greenhouse gases.

“in fits and starts”

It is strange that Michaels emphasises this, because that is exactly the main reason why his idea that there was a “hiatus” in man-made global warming due to greenhouse gasses is so terribly wrong. Does anyone see a “hiatus” in the graph below? You no longer need statistics to tell you that this meme was wrong.

",,,,"“Before carbon dioxide from economic activity could have warmed us up, temperatures rose three-quarters of a degree Fahrenheit between 1910 and World War II.”","Also before 1950 there was warming due to greenhouse gasses. Part of this warming was compensated by increases air pollution that also comes from burning fossil fuels. However, CO2 builds up, while air polution has a short life time. In the end, CO2 dominates. Before 1950 there was also warming due to natural causes due to less volcanoes and a stronger Sun.

After 1950 we can say that our best estimate is that all warming was man-made, but also before 1950 part of the warming was man-made. All forcings (physical causes that change the temperature) are shown in this graph from the latest IPCC report.

Climate forcings that cause temperatures to change

","These changes are all a mix of solar radiation increase (before 1940), increased air pollution from industrialization mid-century, and greenhouse gas increase. Plus a few volcanoes and some natural variability. Models can capture all this really well, provided that they include the effects of greenhouse gas increase – otherwise, forget it. So sure, natural variations are in the mix, but human-induced greenhouse warming is becoming more important all the time.

","This statement is a mixture of exaggeration and cherry picking.

First for the cherry picking. Figure 1 shows that the period 1910-1944 had the largest 34 year warming since 1880. Figure 2 (see below) – the same data but plotted against the CO2 forcing, a surrogate for all anthropogenic effects – shows that by 1944 there was already about 0.3C (0.5F) of anthropogenic warming (i.e. 1944 was not “too early”). This is clarified in Fig. 3 that shows the residual: the estimate of the natural variability accounted for about 0.46C of the rise. This seems a lot for natural variablity – except that it was cherry picked to be the largest natural increase since 1880. Fig. 4 shows that it is almost exactly of the magnitude predicted by a 130-140 year return period.
In other words this event is exactly as expected by the theory of anthropogenic warming! Such events are predicted by the theory. See :

Lovejoy, S. 2014: Return periods of global climate fluctuations and the pause, Geophys. Res. Lett. 41, 4704-4710, doi: 10.1002/2014GL060478.

",,"“Until last June, most scientists acknowledged that warming reached a peak in the late 1990s”

","I’m not aware of any scientists that acknowledged this. This statement was always only true if you cherry-pick data and look at short time periods. 1998 was a record hot year, which is why many non-climate-scientists claimed “global warming stopped in 1998”, but that was incorrect. It was incorrect in 1999, and anytime between then and last June. See, for example, Climate myths: Global warming stopped in 1998

",,,,"“a marginally significant warming trend in the data over the past several years, erasing the temperature plateau that vexed climate alarmists have found difficult to explain.”

","As this figure shows, the corrections made to the NOAA dataset last year only changed their global temperature estimates very slightly compared to their previous dataset. (See Karl et al., 2015, Science, for details). Regarding the “erasing” of the “temperature plateau” (aka “hiatus”), as NASA’s Gavin Schmidt pointed out, “The fact that such small changes to the analysis make the difference between a hiatus or not merely underlines how fragile a concept it was in the first place.”",,,,"“When the Pacific circulation returns to its more customary mode, all that suppressed cold water will surge to the surface with a vengeance, and global temperatures will drop. Temperatures in 1999 were nearly three-tenths of a degree lower than in 1998, and a similar change should occur this time around, though it might not fit so neatly into a calendar year. Often the compensatory cooling, known as La Niña, is larger than the El Niño warming.”

","This avoids the point. If one fits a trend through just the El Niño years, or just the La Nina years, or just the neutral years, the result is the same – significant warming. ENSO adds year-to-year variations, but greenhouse gas increase provides the trend.

",,,,“the rate of warming in the satellite-sensed data is barely a third of what it was supposed to have been”,"One wonders where this number, “a third”, comes from. The global mean temperature trend of the tropospheric temperatures (estimated by satellite) is very similar to that of the surface temperature over the short period for which we have satellite data.

It is expected that the tropospheric temperature would rise a bit faster than the surface temperature, but this is a small deviation. Far from the completely false claim of Michaels that the warming is only a third of what it should be.

As in any case, this deviation could be due to the models, the measurements, their data processing or the comparison. One would need to understand the reasons for this small deviation before one can claim that the models would need to be a little less sensitive.

",,,,"“50% the modeled temperature forecasts for the rest of this century”

","This is pure hand waving without any substance to support it. The comparison between climate models and measurements suggest a good agreement

",,,,"“The notion that world-wide weather is becoming more extreme is just that: a notion, or a testable hypothesis. As data from the world’s biggest reinsurer, Munich Re and University of Colorado environmental-studies professor Roger Pielke Jr. have shown, weather-related losses haven’t increased at all over the past quarter-century. In fact, the trend, while not statistically significant, is downward.”","This statement is not accurate, as 1) The main point is that up to now, we do not see an increase in loss records such as from Munich Re, due to anthropogenic climate change. That is not to say there is no increase in extreme weather, because there is. See IPCC SREX and AR5 reports, to which I also contributed. There is no signal in most loss records from floods and storms, though. So Patrick Michaels is misusing scientific information and consensus.

And 2) it misses a point: there is an upward trend in losses, only after correction for population growth and wealth increase, this trend disappears. See the paper Roger Pielke and Munich Re wrote together, with me: Confronting Disaster Losses

And also this recent review I did (freely accessible): Have Disaster Losses Increased Due to Anthropogenic Climate Change?

","Right… that’ll be why the Munich-Re website states (quoting Professor Peter Höppe, Head of Munich Re’s Geo Risks Research/Corporate Climate Centre): “Climate change is one of the greatest risks facing humankind this century. Through a part of its core business, the insurance industry is directly affected and therefore assumes a leading role in devising solutions for climate protection and adaptation to the inevitable changes.”

",,,"“Last year showed the second-smallest weather-related loss of Global World Productivity, or GWP, in the entire record”","It is actually false, interesting that he brought this up. I consulted my reinsurance contacts and have several links that indicate the opposite view, that they are very concerned about mounting climate-related losses.

","studies substantiates, that changes in climate conditions, primarily global temperatures and expected sea levels are likely to increase the severity, and possibly the frequency, of weather related natural disasters and catastrophes relative to the historical experience over the past 100 years. Coupled with currently projected demographic trends in catastrophe-exposed regions, we currently estimate that this expected increase in severe weather, such as tropical cyclone intensity, over coming periods will increase the average economic value of expected losses, increase the number of people exposed per year to natural disasters and in general exacerbate disaster risk, including risks to infrastructure, global supply chains and agricultural production.”

“No climate-change deniers to be found in the reinsurance business“: “In Munich Re’s offices, there wasn’t much debate as the claims cheques flew out the door: The higher frequency of extreme weather events is influenced by climate change; and recent climate change is largely due to burning hydrocarbons. “I’m quite convinced that most climate change is caused by human activity,” says Peter Höppe, head of geo-risks research at Munich Re.“

Analysis of “2015 Was Not Even Close To Hottest Year On Record”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/james-taylor-2015-was-not-even-close-to-hottest-year-on-record/,2015 Was Not Even Close To Hottest Year On Record,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2016/01/14/2015-was-not-even-close-to-hottest-year-on-record/?sh=7170b4ef5539,"Forget what global warming activists would lead you to believe – 2015 was not even close to the hottest year on record.

Satellite temperature readings going back to 1979 show 1998 was by far the warmest year in the satellite era, followed by 2010. 2015 comes in third. And these results are only for the period since 1979.

2015 should have been warmer. This past year saw what is likely the most powerful El Nino during the satellite temperature record. With a record El Nino, we should have experienced record high temperatures. Yet we didn’t.

A record El Nino resulting in less-than-record temperatures is another sign that global warming is not all that activists crack it up to be. Indeed, if a record strong El Nino cannot bring global temperatures back to the warmth of 1998, what can – and when will that be? 18 years after 1998, global warming still has not created the runaway warming we were told to expect.

Of course, it is not too difficult for activists to paint a picture of an exceptionally warm world – record El Nino or not – when they conveniently define “the record” as merely extending back to the late 1800s. Global warming activists do not extend “the record” back any further, they say, because it has only been since the late 1800s that we have had a global network of mercury thermometers. But we do have other reliable indicators of temperatures before the late 1800s, and the evidence shows temperatures have been warmer than today for most of the past several thousand years, including warmer-than-present temperatures for most of the human civilization time period.

Scientists measuring oxygen isotopes from ice cores drilled in Greenland and Antarctica (among other methods) report that temperatures were significantly warmer than today for most of the past 10,000 years. With the exception of the Little Ice Age, which lasted from approximately 1300-1850 and which almost ushered in a full-blown new ice age epoch, current temperatures remain cooler than almost all other time periods in human history.

So how do global warming activists get away with raising constant alarm and making such outrageous claims as 2015 being the hottest ever? The answer is misleading head-fakes, doctored temperature records, and a compliant media that is more than willing to push the agenda of global warming activists.

No, Virginia, 2015 was not the hottest year on record. In fact, it wasn’t even close.

Update Jan. 25, 2016: As I predicted in this article, global warming activists have indeed made a full-blown public relations effort to claim 2015 was the warmest year on record. This calls for a little more discussion of the relative reliability of satellite temperature measurements, surface temperature measurements, and adjusted surface temperature measurements.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) instruments aboard NASA satellites use microwave frequencies to measure the radiance of the Earth. Scientists then apply objective mathematical formulas to produce precise temperature measurements from the radiance data. For temperature readings, the measurements focus on readings at approximately 10,000 feet (about two miles) above the Earth’s surface, where physics tell us the warming impacts of accumulating carbon dioxide should be moderately stronger than at the Earth’s surface. In other words, the satellite data is objective, precise, and should report moderately more warming than at the Earth’s surface.

By contrast, temperature measurements at the Earth’s surface are less reliable. Temperature stations are not uniformly distributed like the atmospheric sampling of satellite instruments. Population growth and the effects of creeping urbanization create urban heat islands of local warmth that have nothing to do with greenhouse gases or global warming. Changes in land use at or near surface temperature stations also impact temperature readings. For these and other reasons, surface temperature readings lack the precision and consistent quality of satellite temperature data.

We do, however, have some means of attempting to pull accurate temperature data from surface temperature stations. For example, some surface temperature stations are located at sites better insulated from artificial temperature signals and are better maintained than others. Data from these surface temperature stations should be afforded more confidence than data from more suspect locations and stations.

As I recently reported at Forbes.com, a study presented last month at the American Geophysical Union found that well-sited and well-maintained stations report significantly less warming than the surface station network as a whole.

Government overseers collect the raw temperature data from the full network of surface stations and then produce temperature summaries for public distribution. One would expect that the government overseers would simply report the raw data that was collected. In the alternative, one might expect the government overseers to adjust the recent temperature data downward to reflect the false warming signal of creeping urbanization and the studies showing uncorrupted surface temperature stations report less warming than the full network of corrupted and uncorrupted temperature stations. Instead, and remarkably, government overseers adjust the data to add more recent warming than is being reported in the raw temperature readings. Only after government overseers make these highly suspect adjustments are temperature “records” capable of showing anything approaching record warmth.

Ultimately, we must decide on a hierarchy of accuracy and reliability for temperature “reports.” The most objective and scientifically justifiable current hierarchy is, in order, (1) satellite readings (2) raw, unadjusted surface readings culled solely from the best-maintained surface stations (3) raw surface temperature readings from the network as a whole, adjusted downward in recent years to reflect creeping urbanization (4) raw, unadjusted surface temperature readings from the network as a whole and (5) surface temperature readings adjusted upward in recent years in defiance of common sense and objective scientific studies.

Global warming activists choose the fifth option as a means to make “record warmth” claims.

It only comments on the temperature in the troposphere (not at the surface of the Earth, where people live) and ignores most of the data available to discuss whether or not Earth’s climate is warming.

Note that another contributor to Forbes published an accurate article on the subject, however the inaccurate article has been read 15-20 times more (26k) than the accurate one (1.5k) as of Jan 22, 2016.

The author is guilty of ignoring the surface temperature record, which is probably more accurate than the satellite temperature record.

It omits the surface temperature data from the last 100 years, which show that it was a record warm year. It presents logical flaws by first showing the satellite data of lower tropospheric temperature estimates from 1979 to the present to say that 1998 was warmer than 2015 and then argues that the surface temperature record from the last 100 years was too short to make an argument. What I find most disturbing is that the author paints scientific facts as coming from “activists” and being “doctored”. Clearly an attempt to discredit science.

",,,,,,,,,“Forget what global warming activists would lead you to believe—2015 was not even close to the hottest year on record.”,"This is simply false. 2015 was indeed the hottest year on record. This was rigorously determined by a large group of climate scientists. By calling these scientists “global warming activists,” the author misleadingly implies that the claim is made by a fringe group of non-expert partisans.

The answer is misleading head-fakes, doctored temperature records, and a compliant media that is more than willing to push the agenda of global warming activists.”

","A wild misrepresentation of reality. Reputable scientists, not activists, compile these records. As for a compliant media, it’s generally the opposite. Many media outlets seem only too pleased to run disinformation pieces like this one, in the name of “balance”.

",,,,“doctored temperature records”,"The irony is that the “undoctored” raw temperature records also show that 2015 was the warmest year ever, and actually show a lot more global warming over the past 150 years:

",,,,“Satellite temperature readings going back to 1979 show 1998 was by far the warmest year in the satellite era”,"In that particular record, yes. But what does it measure? An estimate of temperature in a layer above the earth’s surface, derived from observations of radiation into space. It is one of the most adjusted and manipulated records out there. And it is about the only one that shows 1998 as the warmest year. Look at thermometer records, ocean temperature, ice melt, atmospheric moisture content, you name it. They all show the same things, that the earth system is warming steadily.

","One wonders here if the author is aware that satellite measurements of the “Lower Atmosphere” (a few km in the atmosphere) do not measure the same thing as surface temperature. So they don’t need to be exactly the same. So in a sense he is comparing apples with oranges here (or mandarines with oranges, if you will).

","Satellite records do not measure the surface of the earth, where we live; rather, they measure the temperature of the lower atmosphere. They are also subject to large uncertainties due to the need for corrections of factors like orbital decay and coverage / scan time changes. If you look at the uncertainty range of estimates for satellites, it is much larger than that of surface temperatures and really can’t tell us anything about the correctness of the surface temperature trend.

",,"“Satellite temperature measurements show 1998 and 2010 were warmer than 2015. Image courtesy of drroyspencer.com.”

","The UAH6.0 dataset has not been published yet and scientists have thus not had the opportunity to check these results. UAH6 used very different methods to estimate the temperatures and having a much smaller recent trend than the previous UAH5 dataset.

An awkward choice to use UAH6.0 to contrast to the well vetted and more reliable trend estimates of the surface temperature by six different groups world wide. A balanced journalist would at least also show these results.

",,,,"“But we do have other reliable indicators of temperatures before the late 1800s, and the evidence shows temperatures have been warmer than today for most of the past several thousand years, including warmer-than-present temperatures for most of the human civilization time period”","This is a complete fabrication. The paleoclimate record suggests that the current warmth is unprecedented for at least the last 1400 years. And it is the cause of the current warming (fossil fuel burning) that’s the real story.

",,,,"“we do have other reliable indicators of temperatures before the late 1800s”

","How convenient that indicators of temperature are deemed “reliable” to support this fallacy, but unreliable otherwise! The author cannot have it both ways: if the temperature record is reliable prior to the instrumental era (starting in the 1800s), then it is a fortiori reliable afterwards ; and all surface temperature analyses show an extremely strong warming that cannot be explained without man-made forcing, CO2 leading the pack.

The paleoclimate record unequivocally shows that temperature maxima coincide with high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/ Chap 5), which is also the cause of the present warming.

",,,,"“With a record El Niño, we should have experienced record high temperatures. Yet we didn’t.”","We certainly did experience a record high temperature (as shown by James Renwick above. A 1 degree celsius (or 2 F) El Niño warming increases the global temperature by 0.1 deg C (or 0.2 F). This year’s El Niño has added about 0.3 deg C driving the global temperature up to 1 C (2 F) above the pre-industrial value. As decades go by the El Niño warming becomes relatively smaller and smaller compared to human induced global warming (+50% in the 90s and just +30% now for the same extreme El Niño).

","The last record of the satellite tropospheric temperatures in 1998 was in the year after an El Nino. This may well be the case again. Climate predictions on the short-term are difficult, but it is expected that 2016 will again be a record year.

","Calendar years with record temperatures tend to occur in the year following the peak of the El Nino event. This was true for the 1997-1998 and 2009-2010 El Ninos in the satellite data. The fact that 2015 was a record year in the surface temperature record probably means that 2016 will even be a bigger record breaker.

",,"“Indeed, if a record strong El Niño cannot bring global temperatures back to the warmth of 1998, what can—and when will that be?”","In the surface temperature record, 5 independent groups all find that 2015 far exceeded the temperature of 1998 and was the warmest year on record by a significant margin:

"Analysis of “2015 Was Hottest Year in Historical Record, Scientists Say”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/analysis-justin-gillis-2015-hottest-year-global-warming/,"2015 Was Hottest Year in Historical Record, Scientists Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/science/earth/2015-hottest-year-global-warming.html,"Scientists reported Wednesday that 2015 was the hottest year in the historical record by far, breaking a mark set only the year before — a burst of heat that has continued into the new year and is roiling weather patterns all over the world.

In the contiguous United States, the year was the second-warmest on record, punctuated by a December that was both the hottest and the wettest since record-keeping began. One result has been a wave of unusual winter floods coursing down the Mississippi River watershed.

Scientists started predicting a global temperature record months ago, in part because an El Niño weather pattern, one of the largest in a century, is releasing an immense amount of heat from the Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere. But the bulk of the record-setting heat, they say, is a consequence of the long-term planetary warming caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.

“The whole system is warming up, relentlessly,” said Gerald A. Meehl, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.

It will take a few more years to know for certain, but the back-to-back records of 2014 and 2015 may have put the world back onto a trajectory of rapid global warming, after a period of relatively slow warming dating to the last powerful El Niño, in 1998.

Politicians attempting to claim that greenhouse gases are not a problem seized on that slow period to argue that “global warming stopped in 1998,” with these claims and similar statements reappearing recently on the Republican presidential campaign trail.

Statistical analysis suggested all along that the claims were false, and that the slowdown was, at most, a minor blip in an inexorable trend, perhaps caused by a temporary increase in the absorption of heat by the Pacific Ocean.

“Is there any evidence for a pause in the long-term global warming rate?” said Gavin A. Schmidt, head of NASA’s climate-science unit, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in Manhattan. “The answer is no. That was true before last year, but it’s much more obvious now.”

Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, calculated that if the global climate were not warming, the odds of setting two back-to-back record years would be remote, about one chance in every 1,500 pairs of years. Given the reality that the planet is warming, the odds become far higher, about one chance in 10, according to Dr. Mann’s calculations.

Two American government agencies — NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — compile separate analyses of the global temperature, based upon thousands of measurements from weather stations, ships and ocean buoys scattered around the world. Meteorological agencies in Britain and Japan do so, as well. The agencies follow slightly different methods to cope with problems in the data, but obtain similar results.

The American agencies released figures on Wednesday showing that 2015 was the warmest year in a global record that began, in their data, in 1880. British scientists released figures showing 2015 as the warmest in a record dating to 1850. The Japan Meteorological Agency had already released preliminary results showing 2015 as the warmest year in a record beginning in 1891.

On Jan. 7, NOAA reported that 2015 was the second-warmest year on record, after 2012, for the lower 48 United States. That land mass covers less than 2 percent of the surface of the Earth, so it is not unusual to have a slight divergence between United States temperatures and those of the planet as a whole.

The end of the year was especially remarkable in the United States, with virtually every state east of the Mississippi River having a record warm December, often accompanied by heavy rains.

A warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor, and an intensification of rainstorms was one of the fundamental predictions made by climate scientists decades ago as a consequence of human emissions. That prediction has come to pass, with the rains growing more intense across every region of the United States, but especially so in the East.

The term global warming is generally taken to refer to the temperature trend at the surface of the planet, and those are the figures reported by the agencies on Wednesday.

Some additional measurements, of shorter duration, are available for the ocean depths and the atmosphere above the surface, both generally showing an inexorable long-term warming trend.

Most satellite measurements of the lower and middle layers of the atmosphere show 2015 to have been the third- or fourth-warmest year in a 37-year record, and scientists said it was slightly surprising that the huge El Niño had not produced a greater warming there. They added that this could yet happen in 2016.

When temperatures are averaged at a global scale, the differences between years are usually measured in fractions of a degree. In the NOAA data set, 2015 was 0.29 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 2014, the largest jump ever over a previous record. NASA calculated a slightly smaller figure, but still described it as an unusual one-year increase.

The intense warmth of 2015 contributed to a heat wave in India last spring that turns out to have been the second-worst in that country’s history, killing an estimated 2,500 people. The long-term global warming trend has exacted a severe toll from extreme heat, with eight of the world’s 10 deadliest heat waves occurring since 1997.

Only rough estimates of heat deaths are available, but according to figures from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, in Brussels, the toll over the past two decades is approaching 140,000 people, with most of those deaths occurring during a European heat wave in 2003 and a Russian heat wave in 2010.

The strong El Niño has continued into 2016, raising the possibility that this year will, yet again, set a global temperature record. The El Niño pattern is also disturbing the circulation of the atmosphere, contributing to worldwide weather extremes that include a drought in southern Africa, threatening the food supply of millions.",very_high,"Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning, Unbiased",562,"The article accurately covers the news that the global surface temperature of the planet in 2015 has set a new record, well above any previous measurement.

This is why detecting climate change and a human influence cannot be done on just a few specific years. Climate scientists consider several decades to average out the naturally variability of the climate. A few very cold days in spring do not imply winter has arrived, do they?

Analysis of “Scientists say human greenhouse gas emissions have canceled the next ice age”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/analysis-of-chris-mooney-scientists-say-human-greenhouse-gas-emissions-have-canceled-the-next-ice-age/,Scientists say human greenhouse gas emissions have canceled the next ice age,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/01/13/scientists-say-humans-have-basically-canceled-the-next-ice-age/,"At a time of intense planetary warming, it’s odd to even contemplate a counterfactual world in which we might instead be in or heading into a glacial period, sometimes more popularly called an “ice age.”

But new research published Wednesday in the influential journal Nature suggests that we may have had a close scrape with such a period earlier in the current geological epoch known as the Holocene — and that pre-industrial human modifications of the climate through agriculture, fires and deforestation might have just barely staved it off.

“Humanity narrowly escaped a glacial inception in the middle of the Holocene, which was almost suppressing the formation of civilization,” says Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, one of the paper’s three authors and founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (the other authors are also affiliated with the institute).

Moreover, the study says, massive human greenhouse gas emissions since that time have likely “postponed” what might otherwise be another ice age “by at least 100,000 years.”

The new research is based on the idea that there are two key factors that shape whether the Earth goes into an ice age (or glacial period) or not.  There’s one that humans can influence, as well as one they really can’t.

The factor out of our control is the Earth’s Milankovitch cycles, which describe the erratic way in which the planet orbits the sun and spins on its axis over vast time periods. The Earth’s orbit grows slowly more and less elliptical, even as the angle of the planet’s axial tilt, and the wobble of the poles as the planet spins (much like what you see with a spinning top), also change slightly over thousands of years.

All of this can affect the delivery of sunlight over different parts of the Earth and the nature of the seasons — for instance, causing summers to be colder — and thus, whether it’s possible to build up huge ice masses on land. Critically, how much sun the Earth’s northern hemisphere high latitudes receive in summer shapes whether ice can build up there over long periods, the new study says.

But there’s also a second factor that’s in our control — how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere. We are able to turn this knob by how many forests we cut down and how many fossil fuels we burn, both processes that transfer carbon from the land (or beneath it) into the atmosphere.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide traps heat and so causes an overall warming effect, and this will happen no matter where the planet is in its various orbital cycles. And if there’s enough of it, it can counteract the tendency of these cycles to make and then unmake ice ages.

“We wanted to understand what is really triggering glacial inception, and what we found is an amazingly simple function, which is the ratio between insolation around 65 north latitude and the CO2 content of the atmosphere,” Schellnhuber said. “And this is more or less summarizing the two key factors in the development of glacial cycles over the last at least 800,000 years.”

Specifically, using analysis of past planetary glaciations and a computer model of the Earth that is able to predict their occurrence, the researchers found that carbon dioxide concentrations were only slightly too high to push us into glaciation a few thousand years ago. Instead, we enjoyed the relatively friendly (for humans) interglacial climate of the Holocene.

“The Earth system would already be well on the way towards a new glacial state if the pre-industrial CO2 level had been merely 40 [parts per million] lower than it was during the late Holocene,” the authors write. Indeed, they note that about 800,000 years ago, orbital alignments were similar but carbon dioxide concentrations were around 240 parts per million, and glaciation did indeed occur.

It’s important to note that at present, the Earth is not fully deglaciated — we still have major ice sheets atop Greenland and especially Antarctica. However, in a period of glacial maximum, ice  sheets would also cover northern Europe and much of North America, placing vastly more total ice atop land and thus leading to sea levels radically lower than they are at present.

A key question raised by the research then becomes why carbon dioxide concentrations were higher during the Holocene — the current geological epoch that began 11,700 years ago, unless you agree with some scientists that we’ve now entered the “Anthropocene” — and whether this is natural. Here, the authors walk up to, but do not fully embrace, the idea that humans substantially altered the climate long before the industrial revolution, and specifically, that they upped atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from around 240 parts per million to 280 parts per million through deforestation, agriculture and other means.

This idea is credited to University of Virginia climate scientist William Ruddiman, who was not involved with the current paper. Asked to comment on it, Ruddiman agreed with the work overall but questioned why the authors didn’t more fully embrace his thesis (which they call “debatable”), and the idea that pre-industrial humans headed off a coming ice age through their alterations of the planet’s land surface, even without mass burning of fossil fuels (yet).

“While there is little doubt that industrial-era anthropogenic emissions are now forestalling any possibility of a new ice age, the evidence shown here suggests that this major human intervention started millennia ago,” Ruddiman said in a statement to The Post.

If Ruddiman’s hypothesis is right, then combined with the new research, it would suggest that burgeoning human civilization basically headed off an ice age before that ice age could complicate matters for human civilization, making its establishment and growth considerably more difficult, especially in some key northern hemisphere regions.

And just as the current study’s analysis allows for an explanation of why we did not recently begin an ice age, so it also allows for an assessment of when another is likely to occur. After all, we’ve since gone far beyond any pre-industrial alterations of Earth’s climate and driven atmospheric carbon dioxide levels up to 400 parts per million, with peak concentrations still not yet achieved.

If we had maintained planetary carbon dioxide levels at about 280 parts per million — the pre-industrial level that apparently averted ice age onset — then the research suggests that we may then have enjoyed a relatively stable climatic optimum, conditions that were friendly for civilization for about 50,000 years, without tipping into glaciation or experiencing extreme warming.

Instead, and depending on how much more carbon dioxide we emit, the research says, the planet may not see large ice sheets build for 100,000 years. (It takes a very long time for atmospheric carbon dioxide to be naturally removed again from the atmosphere.)

Indeed, with all the atmospheric CO2, we’re currently headed in the opposite direction: We’re now seeing major changes in Greenland and Antarctica, though it’s not clear yet just how much of these remaining ice sheets we could lose.

“The next two glacial inceptions will be suppressed by the current cumulative emissions, plus the emissions we will unavoidably have over the next 40 to 50 years, even if we keep global warming below 1.5 to 2 degrees,” Schellnhuber said.

“The ice ages are called off, if you like, by human interference,” he said.","high, very_high","Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",55,"The article presents an accurate account of recently published research which suggests that human-induced global warming will delay the onset of the next ice age by 50,000 years. The research supports the findings of several studies published over the past 15 years, and is consistent with the scientific consensus that human activity is changing the climate with very long-term consequences. Although anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions will likely delay the onset of the next ice-age, this is no cause for complacency. As the research notes, at pre-industrial levels of CO2 the planet would not descend into an ice age for another 50,000 years. By contrast, the adverse consequences of global warming are expected to intervene in the coming years, decades and centuries.","That atmospheric carbon dioxide buildup from fossil fuel burning likely will delay the onset of the next glaciation is actually old news; the last emergence of the idea I’m aware of was in 2008, in an article reporting on the work of University of Chicago geoscientist David Archer. The new idea that emerges from the recently published work of Ganopolski et al. is that even if preindustrial levels of 280 ppmv atmospheric CO2 had been sustained to the present and beyond, Earth would have enjoyed an anomalously prolonged warm, interglacial state compared to past interglacials. This finding appears to be robust, but should be evaluated using other earth system models appropriate to study the complicated process of glacial inception.","One thing to be aware of is that this conclusion is not new. For instance, Uchikawa and Zeebe (2008), using a model based on that of Walker and Kasting (1992) came up with the same conclusion, as well as Archer and Ganopolski (2005) who concluded: “We predict that a carbon release from fossil fuels or methane hydrate deposits of 5000 Gton of Carbon could prevent glaciation for the next 500,000 years”. That is not to belittle the present article, who has performed more sophisticated ice sheet modeling than in previous studies. Thus, I would see the new study as giving us greater confidence in conclusions reached by Ganapolski and others in earlier publications.

","The IPCC’s latest projections for sea level rise by century’s end (e.g. IPCC summary for policymakers) range from 40 cm to 63 cm (or 15″ to 25″). A notable component of that will be due to ice loss. So while our carbon emissions may have initially delayed an ice age, this benefit has been traded for the likelihood of fairly adverse consequences in the future.

","James Renwick, Professor, Victoria University of Wellington
","The article is essentially a factual account of the content of the paper, and the material (in the paper and in the WaPo article) covers ideas that have been current for several years, that human-induced greenhouse gases increase has delayed the next ice age.

","Guillaume Leduc, Researcher, CEREGE:","The article fairly reports on one of the findings of one article that has recently been published in the scientific journal Nature. On multi-millenia timescales, orbital parameters are considered as pacemakers of ice ages, but now that CO2 has massively been injected in the atmosphere the next ice age which should have already been much into the pipeline is already aborted.
The article indeed talks about many things clearly established for decades, but that are still valid.

","Rasmus Benestad, Senior scientist, The Norwegian Meteorological institute","The reporting of the research is objective, although the research itself may be perceived as a bit speculative at this point, even if its plausible.

Analysis of “Your Complete Guide to the Climate Debate”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/analysis-of-matt-ridley-benny-peiser-your-complete-guide-to-the-climate-debate/,Your Complete Guide to the Climate Debate,https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-complete-guide-to-the-climate-debate-1448656890,"In February President Obama said, a little carelessly, that climate change is a greater threat than terrorism. Next week he will be in Paris, a city terrorized yet again by mass murderers, for a summit with other world leaders on climate change, not terrorism. What precisely makes these world leaders so convinced that climate change is a more urgent and massive threat than the incessant rampages of Islamist violence?

It cannot be what is happening to world temperatures, because they have gone up only very slowly, less than half as fast as the scientific consensus predicted in 1990 when the global-warming scare began in earnest. Even with this year’s El Niño-boosted warmth threatening to break records, the world is barely half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than it was about 35 years ago. Also, it is increasingly clear that the planet was significantly warmer than today several times during the past 10,000 years.

Nor can it be the consequences of this recent slight temperature increase that worries world leaders. On a global scale, as scientists keep confirming, there has been no increase in frequency or intensity of storms, floods or droughts, while deaths attributed to such natural disasters have never been fewer, thanks to modern technology and infrastructure. Arctic sea ice has recently melted more in summer than it used to in the 1980s, but Antarctic sea ice has increased, and Antarctica is gaining land-based ice, according to a new study by NASA scientists published in the Journal of Glaciology. Sea level continues its centuries-long slow rise—about a foot a century—with no sign of recent acceleration.

Perhaps it is the predictions that worry the world leaders. Here, we are often told by journalists that the science is “settled” and there is no debate. But scientists disagree: They say there is great uncertainty, and they reflected this uncertainty in their fifth and latest assessment for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It projects that temperatures are likely to be anything from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer by the latter part of the century—that is, anything from mildly beneficial to significantly harmful.

As for the impact of that future warming, a new study by a leading climate economist, Richard Tol of the University of Sussex, concludes that warming may well bring gains, because carbon dioxide causes crops and wild ecosystems to grow greener and more drought-resistant. In the long run, the negatives may outweigh these benefits, says Mr. Tol, but “the impact of climate change does not significantly deviate from zero until 3.5°C warming.”","low, very_low","Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",390,"The opinion piece in the WSJ by Matt Ridley & Benny Peiser contains numerous false statements, cherry-picked evidence, and misleading assertions about climate science. It attempts to surround the hard facts about climate change with clouds of uncertainty, even though these facts are agreed to by the scientific academies of every major country in the world and the vast majority of the world’s climate scientists.

Facts and/or studies are cherry picked or placed out of context to support the main claim that global warming is not as bad as we feared. For example the assertion that 1.5C of warming would be “beneficial” is one that very few scientists or economists agree with, and is contradicted by the overwhelming weight of evidence in the IPCC’s reports showing that the adverse impacts from climate change will far outweigh the benefits from carbon-dioxide induced greening and other heat-related effects.

The claim that there has been no increase in frequency/intensity of storms/floods/droughts is misleading. There has been increases in extreme precipitation. It’s wrong that the climate sensitivity is “likely to be anything from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius” – the most likely value is in the central parts of this range, and the fringe values are less probable.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“What precisely makes these world leaders so convinced that climate change is a more urgent and massive threat than the incessant rampages of Islamist violence?”
","Studies like this one: Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought. It is one of many examples illustrating how climate stressors may bring societies into conflict over scarce resources. The exact number of future climate victims is impossible to compute, but even by the most conservative estimates it is many orders of magnitude greater than the hundreds (or conservatively thousands) of people killed yearly by terrorist acts.

","The article starts with an obvious logical fallacy: that because people attend a long-planned meeting on climate change, they must think this issue is more important than terrorism.

","False dichotomy. Climate change and terrorism both can and should be addressed – no matter how one ranks them. By the author’s logic, there couldn’t be a summit on anything else than terrorism right now.


I think the authors are ignorant of the fact that combustion of fossil fuels and solid biofuels today kills between 4-7 million people worldwide EACH year due to the air pollution impacts alone, and these deaths are preventable. This is referenced here.

","Climate change has now been shown to be a contributing cause to the rise of the Islamic State in Syria and a chief national security concern. Happening now are the current refugee crisis and international terrorism spawned by ISIS—a legacy of how climate change helps precipitate conflict as a threat multiplier. Past examples include the Arab Spring uprising (major contributor was a failed crop in Egypt from intense drought), riots in Pakistan and attacks on government officials when drought meant choosing between water to drink and water for hydropower. See recent comments by National security adviser Susan Rice.

","“world temperatures, because they have gone up only very slowly, less than half as fast as the scientific consensus predicted in 1990”","This statement is false. The IPCC predicted that warming between 2015 and 1990 would be within about 0.35 and 0.60C; the actual temperature in 2015 will be about 0.5C above the average of years around 1990, so a bit above the middle of the range originally predicted by the IPCC.

",,,,"“the world is barely half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than it was about 35 years ago”

","This kind of statement seems to imply that 0.5 C change in global temperature is negligible. For reference, readers unfamiliar with the order of magnitude of changes in global temperature should be reminded that the difference between today’s global temperature and that of the the Last Glacial maximum (around 20,000 years ago), when ice sheets extended over northern North America and Northern Europe/Asia, is estimated to be only around 4-5 C (e.g., Annan, J. D. and Hargreaves, J. C.: A new global reconstruction of temperature changes at the Last Glacial Maximum) A warming of a few degrees C globally, as projected today under a business-as-usual scenario, is thus something of geological magnitude.

","Global temperature rise has of course been almost double what this article implies if you compare it to preindustrial rather than just the past 35 years. Which means warming has accelerated, not slowed, contrary to the presentation in this article.

",,,"“Also, it is increasingly clear that the planet was significantly warmer than today several times during the past 10,000 years.”","In addition to likely wrong, this has absolutely no bearing on current human-caused warming. The projections of current warming will greatly exceed temperatures of the past 10,000 years and, more importantly for society and ecosystems, the rate of anthropogenic warming already greatly exceeds any temperature changes in the past 10,000 and even several million years. This rate of warming can have massive societal consequences and will be exceptionally hard for ecosystems and societies to adapt.

","This is incorrect. It is notoriously hard to estimate a global average temperature, even today, let alone in the past. However the most comprehensive attempt to do so was by Marcott et al (A reconstruction of regional and global temperature for the past 11,300 years, Science) They found that early Holocene (10000 to 6000 years ago) warmth was followed by a slow cooling of about 0.7 degrees in the last 5000 years. The warming of the last century has taken global average temperature just above the maximum of the early Holocene – albeit so far only for a short period of time. However, it is clear that as warming continues we are entering a prolonged period that is significantly warmer than any period in the last 10000 years.

",,,"“there has been no increase in frequency or intensity of storms, floods or droughts, while deaths attributed to such natural disasters have never been fewer”","This statement is not justified as several studies are now reporting increases in severe rains and in storm damages even when non-environmental factors are accounted for. Moreover the authors ignore heat waves which show the clearest increase and kill more people than the ones they mention.

","The authors seem to carefully select the types of climate extremes for which, despite projections of increased frequency/intensity of such extremes, observations over recent decades do not allow us to say if present trends are consistent with projections (e.g., droughts).

Note that for other types of climate extremes, like temperature extremes, heat waves, or high-intensity rainfall, observations are in agreement with projections and show an increase attributable to human influence- e.g., Fischer and Knutti, 2015, Anthropogenic contribution to global occurrence of heavy-precipitation and high-temperature extremes, Nature Climate Change.

",,,"“Antarctica is gaining land-based ice, according to a new study by NASA scientists published in the Journal of Glaciology”

","This study examined Antarctic ice sheet mass changes until 2008 and presents a single study of Antarctic ice mass. Also, the mechanism indicated for mass change – increased snowfall – is actually a result of a warming atmosphere and an understood change that is consistent with scientific understanding. Perhaps more pertinent, however, is that other studies, including of more recent changes have suggested overall ice loss and, most important, large future ice loss. Recently published articles (Joughin et al. 2014, Rignot et al. 2014) looking at changes on coastal Antarctic ice shelves shows that we have likely already entered a period of major ice shelf retreat, with no mechanisms in sight to stop this retreat over the next 100s of years. The implication of ice shelf and glacier retreat around the Antarctic coast is increased ice loss over the next 10s to 1000s of years. There is a very large body of scientific work examining Antarctic ice sheet mass trends and there is community agreement that future ice loss is expected and will be worse if global temperatures increase more.

","West Antarctica has been losing mass at an increasing rate since the 1990s and, irrespective of what is happening further East, that trend looks set to continue. Going to the other end of the Earth, the Greenland ice sheet has also been losing mass at an accelerating rate since around 1995. Greenland is now the single biggest source of mass to the oceans. These trends at both poles are huge signals that are unequivocal and uncontested.

",,,“Sea level continues its centuries-long slow rise—about a foot a century—with no sign of recent acceleration.”,"“Recent” is not a precise term. On climate relevant scale, evidence shows that sea level rise has been accelerating. See for instance the figure below from Jevrejeva et al

",,,,"“But scientists disagree: They say there is great uncertainty”

","This is highly misleading. Uncertainty is a fixture of life and is absolutely no reason for not taking policy action. There will always be uncertainty in science (in the form of standard deviations around estimates, for instance), but the scientists fundamentally do not disagree that: 1) humans’ emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary cause of climate change of the past 50-60 years, and 2) consequences are likely to be significantly harmful. See here and here.

",,,,"“It projects that temperatures are likely to be anything from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer by the latter part of the century”
","This is the range for the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity, not for the temperature in 2100. This temperature depends on how much we will mitigate climate change for which there are no predictions.

This is a wide range of climate sensitivities, but not a sign of disagreement in the scientific community as the op-ed suggests. This range is a fair summary of the evidence for most scientists.
","The authors confuses the “sensitivity” (which they correctly notes ranges from 1.5-4.5C) with the actual warming that we’d have by 2100 (which ranges from 3-6C). There is no way that 3C of warming would be beneficial, and there is no way that we would get away with less than 3C of warming on a business-as-usual emissions pathway. 4C or more of warming would probably render some regions of the planet uninhabitable due to heat stress and cause massive disruption to all societies; 3C might even be enough to do that, we don’t know.

",,,"“…that is, anything from mildly beneficial to significantly harmful.”

","This sentence is very misleading. Even assuming that 1.5 C would be mildly beneficial – which is an unsubstantiated claim at this point – this sentence omits to mention that this more modest warming implies strong and rapid human action to limit greenhouse gas emissions – it is not at all an equally likely outcome of a business-as-usual scenario!

A large part in the uncertainties from IPCC projections for the end of the 21st century is due to human behavior, e.g., mainly how much of fossil fuels we will burn (RCPs on the figure below).

Note as well that for a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5), warming does not stop in 2100, but goes on after that.
","The assertion that 1.5C of warming would be “beneficial” is one that very few scientists or economists would agree with other than Richard Tol. It is true that CO2-induced greening will be beneficial, but how beneficial compared to the problems from greater heat and shifting rainfall patterns is dubious at best.

",,,"“a new study by a leading climate economist, Richard Tol of the University of Sussex, concludes that warming may well bring gains, because carbon dioxide causes crops and wild ecosystems to grow greener and more drought-resistant.”

","It is a good idea to check the source. In this case the link goes to an unpublished manuscript.

The manuscript only cites one study with positive impacts. The one of Dr. Tol himself for a 1°C temperature rise, which is a point we have just reached. That impacts for this study become statistically significant only at 3.5°C is because the economic uncertainties are so large. Uncertainties go both ways.
","This is an old and largely debunked idea. The best available evidence suggests that while carbon dioxide concentrations do help some crops in some regions, the increases of temperature and drought stress are non-linear and have and will mostly overwhelm positive effects. In fact, climate change has probably driven declines in crop production of 2 of the 4 largest global crops even in the past 30 years.

",,,"“A key study published in the Journal of Climate this year by Bjorn Stevens of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, found that the cooling impact of sulfate emissions has held back global warming less than thought till now”

","That clouds and aerosols are an important reason for the large confidence interval for the climate sensitivity is generally accepted. However, it is an exaggeration to claim that Bjorn Stevens found this. He presented limited evidence that makes a case for future research into this topic. More in general, one should never judge the state of the art based on single papers, especially new papers.
",,,,"“Scientific skeptics are now routinely censored, or threatened with prosecution.”","This is misleading as it implies that climate skeptics are being threatened with prosecution because of their skeptical views. In reality, the questions of legality directed at climate skeptics (or, more significantly, fossil fuel companies) are based on concerns of conflict of interest, as scientists and others expressing views on climate science that are contradictory to mainstream consensus have in some cases been found to derive significant funding from fossil fuel companies and other groups that stand to profit from delaying climate policies. The recent example of Willie Soon, the Harvard-Smithsonian researcher who neglected to disclose his funding from fossil fuel companies when publishing research skeptical of established climate science, is a prime example of such a conflict of interest.

"Analysis of “Top 10 Global Warming Lies That May Shock You”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/forbes-james-taylor-top-10-global-warming-lies-that-may-shock-you/,Top 10 Global Warming Lies That May Shock You,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2015/02/09/top-10-global-warming-lies-that-may-shock-you/,"Global warming alarmists frequently make false and deplorable assertions (see, for example, my recent column debunking false claims that global warming is causing a decline in wheat production), but the Environmental Defense Fund’s recent fund-raising mailer, “10 Global Warming Effects That May Shock You,” may well set a new low. However, climate realists can make lemonade from EDF’s preposterous mailer by using it to show open-minded people the difference between global warming alarmists and global warming truth-tellers.

EDF has assembled what it believes to be the 10 most powerful global warming assertions in the alarmists’ playbook, yet each assertion either backfires on alarmists or has been proven false. While reading how flawed EDF’s assertions are, remember these are the very best arguments global warming alarmists can make. Open-minded readers should have very little difficulty dismissing the mythical global warming crisis after examining the top 10 assertions in the alarmist playbook.

Alarmist Assertion #1

“Bats Drop from the Sky – In 2014, a scorching summer heat wave caused more than 100,000 bats to literally drop dead and fall from the sky in Queensland, Australia.”

The Facts

Global warming alarmists’ preferred electricity source – wind power – kills nearly 1 million bats every year (to say nothing of the more than 500,000 birds killed every year) in the United States alone. This appalling death toll occurs every year even while wind power produces just 3% of U.S. electricity. Ramping up wind power to 10, 20, or 30% of U.S. electricity production would likely increase annual bat kills to 10-to-30 million every year. Killing 30 million bats every year in response to dubious claims that global warming might once in a great while kill 100,000 bats makes no sense.

Just as importantly, alarmists present no evidence that global warming caused the summer heat wave in a notoriously hot desert near the equator.  To the contrary, climate change theory and objective data show our recent global warming is occurring primarily in the winter, toward the poles, and at night.

Australia’s highest recorded temperature occurred more than half a century ago, and only two of Australia’s seven states have set their all-time temperature record during the past 40 years. Indeed, Queensland’s 2014 heat wave paled in comparison to the 1972 heat wave that occurred 42 years of global warming ago. If global warming caused the 2014 Queensland heat wave, why wasn’t it as severe as the 1972 Queensland heat wave? Blaming every single summer heat wave or extreme weather event on global warming is a stale and discredited tactic in the alarmist playbook. Objective science proves extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, heat waves, and droughts have become less frequent and less severe as a result of the Earth’s recent modest warming.

Alarmist Assertion #2

“Lyme Disease Spreads” – Warmer temperatures are contributing to the range expansion and severity of tick-borne Lyme disease.”

The Facts

Lyme Disease is much more common in northern, cooler regions of the United States than in southern, warmer regions. Asserting, without any supporting data or evidence, that a disease that prospers in cool climates will become more prevalent as a result of global warming defies objective data and common sense. Moreover, a team of scientists extensively researched Lyme Disease climate and habitat and reported in the peer-reviewed science journal EcoHealth, “the only environmental variable consistently association with increased [Lyme Disease] risk and incidence was the presence of forests.”

Granted, alarmists can argue that forests are thriving under global warming, with the result that forest-dwelling ticks will also benefit. However, expanding forests are universally – and properly – viewed as environmentally beneficial. Alarmist attempts to frame thriving forests as harmful perfectly illustrate the alarmists’ proclivity to claim anything and everything – no matter how beneficial – is severely harmful and caused by global warming.

Moreover, even if global warming expanded Lyme Disease range, one must look at the totality of global warming’s impact on the range of viruses and diseases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports Lyme Disease “is rare as a cause of death in the United States.” According to the CDC, Lyme Disease is a contributing factor to less than 25 deaths per year in the United States. Indeed, during a recent five-year span examined by the CDC, “only 1 [death] record was consistent with clinical manifestations of Lyme Disease.” Any attempts to claim global warming will cause a few more Lyme Disease deaths must be weighed against the 36,000 Americans who are killed by the flu each year. The U.S. National Institutes of Health have documented how influenza is aided and abetted by cold climate. Any attempt to connect a warmer climate to an increase in Lyme Disease must be accompanied by an acknowledgement of a warmer climate’s propensity to reduce influenza incidence and mortality. The net impact of a warmer climate on viruses and diseases such as Lyme Disease and influenza is substantially beneficial and life-saving.

Alarmist Assertion #3

“National Security Threatened – The impacts of climate change are expected to act as a ‘threat multiplier’ in many of the world’s most unstable regions, exacerbating droughts and other natural disasters as well as leading to food, water and other resource shortages that may spur mass migrations.”

The Facts

The alarmists’ asserted national security threat depends on assertions that (1) global warming is causing a reduction in food and water supplies and (2) migrations of people to places with more food and water will increase risks of military conflict. Objective facts refute both assertions.

Regarding food and water supplies, global crop production has soared as the Earth gradually warms. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is essential to plant life, and adding more of it to the atmosphere enhances plant growth and crop production. Longer growing seasons and fewer frost events also benefit plant growth and crop production. As this column has repeatedly documented (see articles here, here, and here, for example), global crops set new production records virtually every year as our planet modestly warms. If crop shortages cause national security threats and global warming increases crop production, then global warming benefits rather than jeopardizes national security.

The same holds true for water supplies. Objective data show there has been a gradual increase in global precipitation and soil moisture as our planet warms. Warmer temperatures evaporate more water from the oceans, which in turn stimulates more frequent precipitation over continental land masses. The result of this enhanced precipitation is an improvement in soil moisture at almost all sites in the Global Soil Moisture Data Bank. If declining precipitation and declining soil moisture are military threat multipliers, than global warming is creating a safer, more peaceful world.

Alarmist Assertion #4

“Sea Levels Rising – Warmer temperatures are causing glaciers and polar ice sheets to melt, increasing the amount of water in the world’s seas and oceans.”

The Facts

The pace of sea level rise remained relatively constant throughout the 20th century, even as global temperatures gradually rose. There has similarly been no increase in the pace of sea level rise in recent decades. Utilizing 20th century technologies, humans effectively adapted to global sea level rise. Utilizing 21st century technologies, humans will be even better equipped to adapt to global sea level rise.

Also, the alarmist assertion that polar ice sheets are melting is simply false. Although alarmists frequently point to a modest recent shrinkage in the Arctic ice sheet, that decline has been completely offset by ice sheet expansion in the Antarctic. Cumulatively, polar ice sheets have not declined at all since NASA satellite instruments began precisely measuring them 35 years ago.

Alarmist Assertion #5

“Allergies Worsen – Allergy sufferers beware: Climate change could cause pollen counts to double in the next 30 years. The warming temperatures cause advancing weed growth, a bane for allergy sufferers.”

The Facts

Pollen is a product and mechanism of plant reproduction and growth. As such, pollen counts will rise and fall along with plant health and vegetation intensity. Any increase in pollen will be the result of a greener biosphere with more plant growth.  Similar to the alarmist argument, discussed above, that expanding forests will create more habitat for the ticks that spread Lyme Disease, alarmists here are taking overwhelmingly good news about global warming improving plant health and making it seem like this good news is actually bad news because healthier plants mean more pollen.

Indeed, NASA satellite instruments have documented a spectacular greening of the Earth, with foliage gains most prevalent in previously arid, semi-desert regions. For people experiencing an increase in vegetation in previously barren regions, this greening of the Earth is welcome and wonderful news. For global warming alarmists, however, a greener biosphere is terrible news and something to be opposed. This, in a nutshell, defines the opposing sides in the global warming debate. Global warming alarmists claim a greener biosphere with richer and more abundant plant life is horrible and justifies massive, economy-destroying energy restrictions. Global warming realists understand that a greener biosphere with richer and more abundant plant life is not a horrible thing simply because humans may have had some role in creating it.

Alarmist Assertion #6

“Beetles Destroy Iconic Western Forests – Climate change has sent tree-killing beetles called mountain pine beetles into overdrive. Under normal conditions those beetles reproduce just once annually, but the warming climate has allowed them to churn out an extra generation of new bugs each year.”

The Facts

Alarmists claim warmer winters are causing an increase in pine beetle populations. This assertion is thoroughly debunked by objective, real-world data.

As an initial matter, alarmists have responded to recent bitterly cold winters by claiming global warming is causing colder winters. One cannot claim global warming is causing colder winters and then turn around and simultaneously claim global warming is causing warmer winters. Global warming activists’ propensity for doing so shows just how little value they place in a truthful debate.

Objective scientific data verify winters are getting colder, which counters the key prerequisite to EDF’s pine beetle claim. NOAA temperature data show winter temperatures in the United States have been getting colder for at least the past two decades. Pine beetles cannot be taking advantage of warmer winters if winters are in fact getting colder. Moreover, recent U.S. Forest Service data show pine beetle infestations have recently declined dramatically throughout the western United States.

Forests and plant life are expanding globally, and particularly in the western United States. Pine beetles are a natural part of forest ecosystems. Expanding pine forests can support more beetles. The predictable increase in pine beetles is largely a product of, rather than a foil against, expanding pine forests. One can hardly argue that western pine forests are “destroying iconic Western forests” when western forests are becoming denser and more prevalent as the planet warms.

Also, beetles have bored through North American forests for millennia, long before people built coal-fired power plants and drove SUVs. Beetles are not dependent on warm winters, as evidenced by their historic prevalence in places such as Alaska.

Finally, pine beetles tend to target dead, unhealthy, more vulnerable pine trees rather than healthy trees. Decades of over-aggressive fire suppression policies have caused an unnatural buildup of older, denser, more vulnerable pine forests. These conditions predictably aid pine beetles.

Alarmist Assertion #7

“Canada: The New America – ‘Lusher’ vegetation growth typically associated with the United States is now becoming more common in Canada, scientists reported in a 2012 Nature Climate Change study.”

The Facts

Only global warming alarmists would claim that lusher vegetation and more abundant plant life is a bad thing. Playing on a general tendency for people to fear change, EDF and global warming alarmists argue that changes in the biosphere that make it richer, lusher, and more conducive to life are changes to be feared and opposed. If barren ecosystems constitute an ideal planet, then the alarmist fears of more plant life make sense. On the contrary, global warming realists understand a climate more conducive to richer, more abundant plant life is beneficial rather than harmful.

Alarmist Assertion #8

“Economic Consequences – The costs associated with climate change rise along with the temperatures. Severe storms and floods combined with agricultural losses cause billions of dollars in damages, and money is needed to treat and control the spread of disease”

The Facts

Severe storms, floods and agricultural losses may cost a great deal of money, but such extreme weather events – and their resulting costs – are dramatically declining as the Earth modestly warms. Accordingly, EDF’s asserted economic costs are actually economic benefits.

As documented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and here at Forbes.com, severe storms are becoming less frequent and severe as the Earth modestly warms. This is especially evident regarding hurricane and tornado activity, which are both at historic lows. Similarly, scientific measurements and peer-reviewed studies report no increase in flooding events regarding natural-flowing rivers and streams. Any increase in flooding activity is due to human alterations of river and stream flow rather than precipitation changes.

Also, the modest recent warming is producing U.S. and global crop production records virtually every year, creating billions of dollars in new economic and human welfare benefits each and every year. This creates a net economic benefit completely ignored by EDF.

Regarding “the spread of disease,” as documented in “Alarmist Assertion #2,” objective evidence shows global warming will thwart deadly outbreaks of influenza and other cold-dependent viruses.

Additionally, the alarmists’ desired means of reducing carbon dioxide emissions – more expensive energy sources – make economic conditions even worse. Forcing the American economy to operate on expensive and unreliable wind and solar power will have tremendous negative economic consequences. President Obama acknowledged this fact when he promised that under his global warming plan, “electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.” The economic consequences of Obama’s global warming policies can already be seen in electricity prices, which are currently the highest in U.S. history.  Remarkably, Obama’s global warming policies are increasing electricity prices even while new natural gas discoveries, revolutionary advances in natural gas production technologies, and a dramatic resultant decline in natural gas prices would otherwise spur a dramatic decline in electricity prices.

Alarmist Assertion #9

“Infectious Diseases Thrive – The World Health Organization reports that outbreaks of new or resurgent diseases are on the rise and in more disparate countries than ever before, including tropical illnesses in once cold climates.”

The Facts

Outbreaks of “new or resurgent diseases” are occurring precisely because governments have caved in to environmental activist groups like EDF and implemented their anti-science agendas. For example, DDT had all but eliminated malaria in the United States and on the global stage during the mid-20th century. However, environmental activists championed false environmental accusations against DDT and dramatically reduced use of the life-saving mosquito killer throughout much of the world.  As a result, malaria has reemerged with a vengeance and millions of people die every year as a result.

Also, as documented above in “Alarmist Assertion #2,” global warming will reduce the impact and death toll of cold-related viruses such as influenza. In the United States alone, influenza kills 36,000 people every year, which dwarfs all heat-dependent viruses and diseases combined. Few people other than global warming alarmists would argue that it is better to have 36,000 people die each year from influenza than have a few people die each year from Lyme Disease (which, as documented above, isn’t even related to global warming).

Alarmist Assertion #10

“Shrinking Glaciers – In 2013, an iceberg larger than the city of Chicago broke off the Pine Island Glacier, the most important glacier of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. And at Montana’s Glacier National Park glaciers have gone from 150 to just 35 over the past century.”

The Facts

Calling attention to anecdotal incidents of icebergs breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet, while deliberately ignoring the overall growth of the Antarctic ice sheet, is a misleading and favorite tactic of global warming alarmists. Icebergs break off the Antarctic ice sheet every year, with or without global warming, particularly in the Antarctic summer. However, a particular iceberg – no matter how large – breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet does not necessarily result in “Shrinking Glaciers” as EDF alleges. To the contrary, the Antarctic Ice Sheet has been growing at a steady and substantial pace ever since NASA satellites first began measuring the Antarctic ice sheet in 1979. Indeed, during the same year that the EDF claims “an iceberg larger than the city of Chicago” broke off the Antarctic ice sheet and caused “Shrinking Glaciers,” the Antarctic ice sheet repeatedly set new records for its largest extent in recorded history. Those 2013 records were repeatedly broken again in 2014. The Antarctic ice sheet in 2013 and 2014 was more extensive than any time in recorded history, and yet the EDF pushes the lie that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is shrinking.

The EDF’s assertion about Glacier National Park is also misleading. Alpine glaciers at Glacier National Park and elsewhere have been receding for over 300 years, since the Earth’s temperature bottomed out during the depths of the Little Ice Age. The warming of the past 300 years and the resulting recession of alpine glaciers predated humans building coal-fired power plants and driving SUVs. Moreover, opening up more of the Earth’s surface to vegetation and plant and animal life would normally be considered a beneficial change, if global warming alarmists had not so thoroughly politicized the global warming discussion.

***************

There you have it. These are the 10 best arguments global warming activists like EDF can make, along with the objective scientific facts that prove them wrong.

No wonder global warming alarmists are so terrified of people having access to both sides of the debate.",very_low,"Biased, Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",161,"According to Forbes.com, this article has been read more than 110,000 times, making it one of Forbes’ most read article on climate in 2015, and author James Taylor is a popular contributor who writes about energy and environment. So how accurate was this article?

Not accurate at all. According to scientists, this article contains numerous factual mistakes and flawed logic about basic science, and the reporting is based on uncredible sources. See the list below for more.

","This is an unusual (as well as misleading) article in that the author mixes sound scientific reasoning with illogical reasoning, and includes patterns and notions supported by data (i.e., facts) with ideas that are wildly inconsistent with the available evidence (falsehoods presented as facts). The misleading aspect comes in because the author picks what are presented as “facts” (sometimes accurate sometimes not accurate whatsoever) and compares these with other “facts” to make a point, but the comparison often has no real relevance to the questions or issues at hand.

","I have rarely read such a misleading and factually inaccurate article. This is not science journalism and has no place in a magazine that purports to be a leading source of reliable news. It cannot qualify as an informed or informative opinion piece, and Forbes does their readers a great disservice by allowing the publication of blatant falsehoods.

The author -James Taylor- has no understanding of the important distinctions between polar sea ice (floating on an ocean) and polar ice sheets (grounded on land), and he confuses their role in sea level rise. Despite Taylor’s protestations, the temporary expansion of Antarctic sea ice (which the author embarrassingly confuses with the expansion of an ice sheet) is well understood in the context of climate change, as is the significant reduction of Arctic sea ice which the author misleadingly understates.

Taylor wrongly equates the existence of Antarctic sea ice with a lack of sea level rise. In fact, floating and melting sea ice cannot contribute to sea level rise, any more than floating and melting ice cubes can cause a glass of water to overflow. By erroneously focusing on sea ice, the author misdirects the reader and thereby conveniently overlooks the two largest current contributors to sea level rise, thermal expansion of oceans and melting glaciers. Mountain glaciers in particular (including those in Glacier National Park as discussed by Taylor) are receding at an unprecedented and increasing rate that has been repeatedly and undeniably linked to man-made climate change. The glaciers’ rapidly increasing contribution to sea level rise is unassailable.

Taylor makes numerous unsubstantiated and entirely non-scientific value judgements about the benefits of climate change, and then he very inappropriately presents these value judgements as logical evidence. Among many egregious examples, the author touts the unproven benefits of increased plant growth as glaciers recede. This is in contrast, for example, to peer-reviewed research showing that as glaciers melt there will be a loss of fresh drinking water to a significant percentage of the world’s population. Taylor’s uncorroborated value judgements should not be presented as if they are on equal footing with facts, and this is a very misleading tactic hiding behind his so-called presentation of science.

I could go on at length about the numerous falsehoods, misrepresentations, misdirections, cherry-picked data, cherry-picked research, and appalling logic in this article, but this sampling is sufficient to demonstrate Taylor’s failure to understand and competently write about climate change.

","Australian bats are fine tuned to a specific threshold – around 42C. Once the temperature is reached they literally DO fall out of trees, and it is primarily lactating mothers and babies this happens to. The more this occurs (as what is projected under anthropogenic climate change), the more they will die, and the less they will be able to recover from what was once a very rare event.

See this article, and publications by the author Just Welbergen.

","Comparing particular dates in times and claiming that global warming should explain everything is a stale and discredited tactic from climate skeptics. What one needs to do is look at robust trends in the data. In his case, it shows that heat waves have increased in frequency/duration since 1950 in some parts of the world (where there is sufficient data to look at such changes), like Europe, Asia, and, yes, South-east Australia.

Asserting, without any supporting data or evidence, that a disease that prospers in cool climates will become more prevalent as a result of global warming defies objective data and common sense.

","The supporting evidence is one 2008 review of the spatial dynamics of Lyme disease by Killilea et al. The authors did conclude that the presence of forests was associated with increased risk of Lyme disease. They also concluded that the reasons for variations across forested areas are poorly understood, and that significant progress is needed in identifying the determinants of spatial variation in risk and incidence.

Between the year 2000 and 2015, there has been 31 publications on Lyme disease and climate change providing significantly more information. The recent US National Assessment Health Chapter concluded that: “Potential impacts of climate change on the transmission of Lyme disease include: 1) changes in the geographic distribution of the disease due to the increase in favorable habitat for ticks to survive off their hosts; 2) a lengthened transmission","1. That Lyme disease occurs in the northeastern states does not mean that the disease process is driven by a cold environment. Indeed the ticks that spread this disease thrive in humid and relatively warm environments. This, combined with increased human outdoor activities during warmer months help explain most cases of Lyme disease occur in the summer months. It has been established that the geographic distribution of the Ixodes tick has increased with warming temperatures.

2. The authors cite an article by Killilea et al, where it is stated, in the context of spatial dynamics, that “the only environmental variable consistently associated with increased Lyme disease was the presence of forests”. This is taken out of context as climate change is not a variable in this analysis. In a more recent article, Ostfeld, the senior author of the Killilea paper, discusses the association between climate warming and increase in the distribution of the Ixodes tick.

",,,"“The alarmists’ asserted national security threat depends on assertions that (1) global warming is causing a reduction in food and water supplies and (2) migrations of people to places with more food and water will increase risks of military conflict. Objective facts refute both assertions.”
","For starters, many experienced leaders—military, political, and otherwise—are extremely concerned about the threat climate change poses to security. See the American Security Project’s work on climate security.

In addition, growing staple crops at higher CO2 reduces their nutritional value.

While some regions have benefited from recent warming, extreme events associated with climate change have already destabilized the world food system. Models consistently show that climate change will adversely effect crop output.

The best available science also shows that even in the past few decades climate change has reduced food production, by as much as 5 billion dollars per year as of 2002.

","This is true, but it does not reflect a lack of climate change influence on beetles.

This is hardly good news.

","To the best of my knowledge, there is no scientific evidence showing that severe storms and flood are “dramatically declining“. Such a strong statement should be supported by a strong reference.

To the contrary, as the atmosphere warms, water vapor content increases, and this is allowing more extreme rainfall events, notably during hurricanes.

",,,,"“Calling attention to anecdotal incidents of icebergs breaking off the Antarctic ice sheet, while deliberately ignoring the overall growth of the Antarctic ice sheet is a misleading and favorite tactic of global warming alarmists”

","Martin Truffer, Professor, University of Alaska Fairbanks:
The author does not know what he is referring to when he says ‘the Antarctic Ice Sheet’. What has been expanding is the extent of sea ice around Antarctica, not the Antarctic Ice Sheet. While icebergs routinely break off Antarctica, the release of this particular iceberg was significant. Iceberg calving from Pine Island Glacier has been occurring at ever increasing rates, and the line of contact between the glacier and the ocean (the grounding line) keeps retreating. It looks even worse at nearby Thwaites Glacier that is now on the brink of unstable retreat, or has already crossed that threshold. See, for example: Joughin et al (2014). Marine Ice Sheet Collapse Potentially Underway for the Thwaites Glacier Basin, West Antarctica.

The basins of Thwaites and Pine Island Glacier hold enough ice to raise global sea level by 1.5 m.

The updated data contradict one of the most frequently asserted global warming claims – that global warming is causing the polar ice caps to recede.",very_low,"Biased, Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",490,"This article has been read more than 660,000 times since it was published in May, making it Forbes’s most read article on climate in 2015. So how accurate was it?

Not accurate at all. According to the reviewers, this article contains numerous factual errors and flawed logic. The author fails to distinguish between sea and land ice, and the Arctic and Antarctic. Taylor’s conclusion, which contradicts the observed signal of global warming on polar ice, is misleading.
","As is clearly explained in a recent article from Carbon Brief, sea ice behavior in the Arctic and Antarctic is responding to climate change in different ways, and we know why.

In the graph below, it is obvious that Arctic sea ice is disappearing at a much faster rate than Antarctic ice is increasing. Numerous studies have concluded that Arctic ice loss results from a combination of thinning due to greenhouse-gas warming, natural events that flushed thick ice out of the region, and various positive feedbacks (amplifying effects) that augment the ice loss. Climate models cannot reproduce observed Arctic sea ice loss without including the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. On this topic the science is settled.

In Antarctica, sea ice varies from year to year much more than it does in the Arctic because its boundaries are not confined by land, as they are in the Arctic. The Southern Ocean sea ice is free to move with the ferocious winds and strong ocean currents that prevail there and cause the large variations. In recent years, the amount of sea ice in winter (when it has a relatively small effect on the global energy balance because there’s no sunlight) has increased, but much less than the amount lost in the Arctic. This increase has been caused by stronger storms (related to a recovering ozone hole) and fresher surface waters (owing to melting of Antarctica’s ice shelves). Because the Antarctic is so much colder than the Arctic, it takes a much larger temperature increase to affect the sea ice, but eventually global warming will cause this sea ice to decline, as well.

Readers of articles such as this that claim to refute decades of peer-reviewed science must arm themselves with a healthy dose of skepticism — the good kind. Dig deeper, inform yourself, and don’t take one non-scientist’s take as gospel just because it supports a position that you hope is true.

extent (million square kilometres), from 1979 to present, against a baseline of 1981-2010. Source: Monthly data available from NOAA, via the NSIDC.

","The article is misleading and completely incorrect. It appears that the article is lumping together sea ice and ice sheets, although perhaps the author does not know the difference between sea ice and the ice on Greenland and Antarctica.

Several outright false statements persist in the article:
1) Sea ice from earlier satellites, submarines, aircraft, whaling log reports, etc. do not show that polar ice caps were more extensive in 1979 than the 1920s. Sea ice also did not remain at 1979 levels until 2005. There is no NASA data that shows this. Arctic sea ice has been declining in all calendar months and in all regions of the Arctic (except for slight increase in the Bering Sea during winter) since the satellite record began, it has not recovered in any way. The Antarctic shows areas of small regional increases that are dependent on the time of year, but in contrast to the Arctic, these increases are not for all sea ice regions and they do not happen in all calendar months.

2) The author also appears confused by the fact that the sea ice grows back every winter and fails to understand the importance of weather. We do not expect each year to exhibit lower sea ice extents than the year before as sea ice responds to the weather patterns, and a particularly cold year may help keep ice around in one summer (such as in 2013). That does not imply the long-term trend is not continuing, just that there are departures from year to year along the long-term trend. Just as one shouldn’t make a big deal out of the record low in 2012, they shouldn’t point to 2013 as a recovery. 2015 shows this to be very true despite the author’s claim of a “dramatic rebound” in 2013, and the false statement that sea ice has been 5% above the 1979 average ever since 2012.

3) May 2015 does not show sea ice 5% above the 1979 average, in fact the Arctic set an all time record low for the winter maximum in 2015. And while the Antarctic had some record high summer ice, the maximum in 2015 was near average.

4) There is no definition of what the author means by land ice, but records show increased melting of Greenland and parts of Antarctica, that together lead to significant increases in global sea level.

","Rasmus Benestad, Senior scientist, The Norwegian Meteorological institute
","The article contains a number of inaccuracies and mixes up different aspects. The sea-ice reduction in the Arctic is a summer-time phenomenon, whereas the Antarctic sea-ice is a winter-time condition. Thus, the sea ice at the two poles involve different mechansisms, in addition to playing out in different geography (the North pole is an ocean basin surrounded by land, whereas the South pole is land surrounded by sea). It’s very naive to think that ice is just ice.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Updated data from NASA satellite instruments reveal the Earth’s polar ice caps have not receded at all since the satellite instruments began measuring the ice caps in 1979.”

","Incorrect on at least two levels. What he compares is ice at a particular time in 1979 with ice at a particular time in 2015. Today (23 October 2015), the figure is negative; ice is again below the long term average, and below values at any time in 1979.

The second and more important level on which this is wrong is that for examining long term trends, scientists use all the data, not just two particular days out of 36 (and growing) years of data. The long term trend is negative.

Both of these can be verified by going to Cryosphere Today, at the University of Illinois.

See also Cryosphere Today’s response to this article.

","This is flat out false. NASA has an excellent visualization and graph of Arctic sea ice decline since 1979. Antarctic sea ice, on the other hand, has had some expansion. However, this expansion does not negate climate change, as explained in this news article.
",,,"“Since the end of 2012, moreover, total polar ice extent has largely remained above the post-1979 average.”

","Extent is a measure of area, but volume also matters. The short-term area increase is due to new thin ice. This ice melts more easily than the older thicker ice which used to occupy this area.

See this news article.

",,,,“The late 1970s marked the end of a 30-year cooling trend.”,"Also misleading. Natural variability is still part of the ongoing climate warming. While the late 1970s were cooler than the years around 1904, it was not a continuous cooling, as seen below. You can also see in this figure that late 1970s temperatures were still high in comparison to the previous 120 years.

",,,,"“As a result, the polar ice caps were quite likely more extensive than they had been since at least the 1920s.”","Mr. Taylor should publish his research on what the sea ice area was. Otherwise, he is simply stating his opinion on a technical topic. And he his not an expert in this topic.

",,,,"“Beginning in 2005, however, polar ice modestly receded for several years.”

","Mr. Taylor’s value judgement of ‘modest’ recession is, again, hampered by not being expert in sea ice. A ‘modest’ change in body temperature from 98.6 F to 108.6 F (only 10 degrees, the outside temperature changes by 30 degrees some days) would be fatal. ‘Modest’ is decided by examining the thing you’re studying.

",,,,"“Total polar ice area—factoring in both sea and land ice—had receded by much less than 10 percent, but alarmists focused on the sea ice loss as ‘proof’ of a global warming crisis.”

","Lumping all of the polar ice together is not very insightful.

First – land ice and sea ice are very different; land ice accumulates for thousands of years while sea ice is a seasonal and inter-annual process. Land ice in Antarctica is melting rapidly which means that water stored for centuries is entering the oceans raising sea level. However, sea ice in Antarctica is slightly gaining likely because of mixing processes between melting freshwater and ocean saltwater. The sea ice in Antarctica has little impact on the energy balance and does not change sea level. One must distinguish between the two different processes of land and sea ice.

Second – Arctic and Antarctic processes are very different. The Antarctic is much cooler than the Arctic, as it is very isolated from the rest of the world with a current that prevents some of the warming from reaching the area. Even though the Antarctic air and sea are warming, because the Antarctic sea ice melts every summer anyways, and the Arctic’s does not, Arctic sea ice melt strongly impacts the energy balance. Sea ice volume in the Arctic has decreased by 50% from 1979 to today – data from the Polar Science Center.

Third – polar ice area is not nearly as telling as polar ice mass or volume, so the metric that the author uses is extremely misleading.

",,,,"“receding polar ice caps have little if any negative impact on human health and welfare, and likely a positive benefit”","This is not true.

Polar ice caps (land ice) have already contributed to sea level rise that has impacted coastal communities all over the world. Currently, mean sea level rise (7.5 inches globally; 1 foot off the Northeast U.S.) manifests its worst impacts through storm surges that are much higher than they would otherwise be. …

Further, Arctic communities have already been impacted by melting ice and permafrost. One resident of an Eskimo community stated in 2012 that “Not that long ago the water was far from our village and could not be easily seen from our homes. Today the weather is changing and is slowly taking away our village. Our boardwalks are warped, some of our buildings tilt, the land is sinking and falling away, and the water is close to our homes. The infrastructure that supports our village is compromised and affecting the health and well-being of our community members, especially our children.” Coastal erosion has threatened many communities, and standard defensive adaptation strategies, such as rock walls, sandbags, and riprap, have been unsuccessful. High costs to relocate have prevented all but one Alaskan village to escape.

"Analysis of “How Hurricane Patricia became the strongest hurricane on record so quickly”
",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/andrew-freedman-mashable-hurricane-patricia-global-warming/,How Hurricane Patricia became the strongest hurricane on record so quickly,https://mashable.com/archive/hurricane-patricia-global-warming,"Hurricane Patricia, which is threatening the coast of western Mexico with a catastrophic impact, intensified at rates that were among the fastest scientists have seen anywhere on Earth. The storm went from 60 mph winds to 200 mph in just 30 hours. By early Friday morning, the storm was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in either the eastern Pacific or entire North Atlantic basin, which also includes the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. It's no coincidence that this storm exploded in an area of near-record warm sea surface temperatures that had not yet been tapped by any other recent storms. It's also an area where atmospheric conditions were favorable for such a storm to strengthen. [seealso url=""http://mashable.com/2015/10/23/hurricane-patricia-mexico/""] Consider this: As of 5 a.m. ET on Thursday, the storm had 85 mile-per-hour winds and a minimum central air pressure of 980 millibars. By 5 a.m. ET on Friday, the winds increased to 200 miles per hour, with an air pressure of 880 millibars. That's an astonishing 100 millibar drop in air pressure in a 24-hour period, which is virtually unheard of. The intensification rate looked like a steep staircase when graphed using a satellite-based computer algorithm that tracks storm intensity.

A period of rapid intensification was forecast by most hurricane prediction models, though none foresaw the sheer ferocity that the storm would eventually achieve.

While scientists have made great strides in recent years in understanding what factors cause hurricanes and typhoons to rapidly intensify, there remain some mysteries about this process. Based on email conversations Mashable had with a half dozen tropical cyclone experts on Friday morning, here's what we know so far.

Warm water served as fuel
The storm exploded over an area of exceptional ocean warmth, with waters of 1 to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year. In addition, the atmospheric conditions in this area were ideally suited for a rapidly strengthening storm, with what is known as ""thermodynamic potential intensity"" readings at a maximum. This occurred right in the area where Patricia spun its way into the record books on Friday morning. The ocean warmth is largely due to a near-record strong El Niño event, which has not only raised ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific, but has also caused those warm waters to extend deeper below the surface than is usually the case, which also helps storms to intensify.

In addition, most of the storms that have formed so far this year -- and there have been a record number in the eastern tropical Pacific -- have formed well west of where Patricia spun up. These left plenty of undisturbed warm water, which is fuel for a storm like this. ""Basically that area closer to Mexico usually has a lot more tropical cyclones nearby,"" said Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ""Since they were all much farther west, Patricia ended up moving over very warm, untapped waters with the rest of the conditions quite ripe.""

Cooperative atmosphere
Ryan Maue, a meteorologist for the private weather firm WeatherBell Analytics, said ""alarm bells"" were ringing on Thursday based on computer model indications that the storm would intensify quickly.

These signals showed an ""optimal/perfect atmosphere and ocean conditions for explosive intensification,"" Maue wrote. He said the fact that Patricia is a small storm, with a compact inner core of intense thunderstorms, helped it to ""deepen pressure within a tiny radius of maximum wind."" (The storm is smaller, in area, than Super Typhoon Haiyan and Hurricane Katrina.) Maue also noted that the ocean temperatures the storm is tapping into are the warmest left in the entire northern hemisphere at this date, at about 31 degrees Celsius, or 88 degrees Fahrenheit. But is this intensification rate an indication of how global warming is altering the characteristics and behavior of nature's most powerful storms? That's a harder question to answer at this point, scientists told Mashable.

Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane expert at MIT, said the lack of a consistent record of eastern Pacific storms using hurricane hunter flights makes it difficult to determine if there is a global warming-related trend in such storms. Such flights are typically flown in the Atlantic and only occasionally in the eastern Pacific, so this was an exceptional case. ""There is no question that this is an exceptionally intense tropical cyclone,"" he wrote. ""But I wonder whether we really know that prior storms in the region have not been equally intense and we are just lucky to have measured this one.""

Global warming considerations
Maue, for his part, said hurricanes tend to respond to more localized conditions when intensifying or weakening, rather than global trends. ""Hurricanes respond locally, and rapid/explosive intensification changes due to climate change could be a result but hard to say with just one storm during a strong El Niño,"" he wrote. Kevin Trenberth, a senior climate researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, said the unusually mild ocean temperatures are allowing more moisture to flow into the storm, which adds fuel to the fire. Trenberth's research has shown that global warming has increased the available water vapor for storms around the world, which plays a role in everything from more intense local downpours to hurricanes. ""The moisture flowing into the storm, that provides its primary fuel, must be higher than it has ever been before,"" he wrote. ""It still requires the right setup to convert that into an intense storm, but the environment is surely ripe. That consists, of course, of a substantial El Niño-related component, but also the background global warming that has a memory through the ocean heat content."" According to Trenberth, El Niño has redistributed ocean heat across the tropical Pacific, putting a bullseye of heat right underneath Hurricane Patricia. ""This is the warmest large-scale spot in the hemisphere,"" Trenberth said. This causes moisture to rush toward that area from relatively cooler ocean waters around it. Sea levels off the coast of Mexico are about 8 inches above average because of the warm bulge of water (water expands as it is heated). ""The subsurface ocean is exceptionally warm as well as the sea surface,"" he said. It's not just El Niño that's boosting ocean temperatures in the eastern Pacific, either. Other natural climate cycles are contributing too, according to hurricane researcher Gabriel Vecchi of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. ""To answer which factors was dominant, and by how much, would take a systematic analysis -- so I don't think I'm willing to shoot for the hip to tell you which ones are important this year, much less for this particular storm,"" he said. ""But it's my opinion that there will be time, and there are ways, to assess the impacts of these factors in the future."" According to Vecchi, projections do show that global warming will increase ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific, which could bring more hurricanes like this one. Tom Knutson, who works in Princeton with Vecchi, told Mashable that a new study shows that the northeast Pacific basin, where Hurricane Patricia is located, will have the largest future increase in the frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms of anywhere on Earth, which he says is ""probably just a coincidence."" He said computer modeling studies that he and his colleagues have published show that manmade warming will increase storm intensities in the future, and that this trend may already have begun to a ""small"" extent in the northeast Pacific. Knutson cautioned that observations of northeast Pacific storms do not show such a trend yet, at least for the period from 1982 to 2009.","high, very_high",Accurate,40,"This article is accurate and based on comments from scientists with actual expertise in the study of climate influence on intense hurricanes.

Analysis of “Climate Change Will Cause Increased Flooding In Coastal Cities ”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/matthew-francis-forbes-even-without-drastic-predictions-coasts-are-in-danger/,Climate Change Will Cause Increased Flooding In Coastal Cities,https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewfrancis/2015/07/28/even-without-drastic-predictions-coasts-are-in-danger/?sh=470308917d0e,"As the world warms, more and more coastlines are under threat from flooding. Melting ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, along with warming ocean waters, are already producing noticeable rises in sea levels. That much is uncontroversial among scientists, and sea-level rise is a major worry for people living in coastal cities and on islands.

A new paper by prominent climate scientist James Hansen and colleagues says even a moderate increase in global temperatures could lead to much greater sea level rise than the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report predicts. Since the IPCC report (last published in 2013) is based on the work of thousands of climate researchers, many people are skeptical of the new paper. Again, this isn't because they doubt climate change is real or that sea-level rise is a big problem. Instead, the critics' concerns are about the details of the model Hansen and his coauthors use.

Based on current trends, Hansen and colleagues modeled how quickly ocean levels are rising. They considered the rate of ice sheet melting in Greenland and Antarctica, along with increases in water temperature. Comparing those present data to models of climate and ocean levels in ancient times, they conclude sea levels could rise several meters in the next century. That catastrophic increase would happen even if global temperatures are held to the conservative limit of 2° Celsius increase, proposed as a reasonable goal by many agencies.

The broad outlines of the paper are within the norm for climate research, but the details are at odds with other studies. The obvious disagreement is the amount of sea level rise, which in this paper is a much higher rate of increase than other models show. Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) writes that the new paper mishandles important short-term climate fluctuations such as the El Niño phenomenon, which can make individual years much warmer than the average. In other words, record-breaking temperatures this year are specifically from El Niño, but the general increase in global temperatures is part of the trend due to climate change.

James Hansen is well known for his role in bringing scientists' worries over climate change to a much wider audience, when he testified before Congress in 1988. He has stated that this new paper could be his most important work, an understandable sentiment. If the results of this paper are true, then rapid sea-level rise will disrupt the lives of huge numbers of people around the world, and governments need to take action immediately.

But that of course is where things can get sticky. Historically, climate scientists have been more conservative than not in making public statements to avoid alarmism and giving fuel to powerful denialist voices. They may not have science on their side, but those who claim either that climate change isn't real or say it's not a big problem have a lot of money and media platforms. The deniers happily pounce on any tiny misstep, real or perceived, by climate researchers and those of us who report on their findings.

Another paper, published yesterday in Nature, had less fanfare than the Hansen paper, but shows the severe danger of flooding in coastal regions, particularly in the United States. This risk isn't directly from sea-level rise, but from the intensification of storm surges and increased precipitation that are secondary effects of climate change. Flooding risk in any particular place depends on a number of factors: the flatness of land right by the water, how steep the continental shelf is off the coast, the number and severity of storms, etc. That's why much of the state of Florida is at greater risk than coastal cities in California.

As the Nature paper shows, heavier rainfall combines with storm surges, the rush of water toward the shore during major storms, to amplify flooding. That combination is deadly: thanks to sea-level rise due to climate change, flooding is going to get much worse. To put it another way: we don't need the ocean to rise several meters to create severe floods. The next decade of ""normal"" hurricanes and tropical storms could bring the effects of climate change right into coastal cities. Updated: I stated initially that extreme storms will increase in frequency and severity, which is not a claim made by the authors of the Nature paper. Rather, usual storms at their regular frequency are enough of a problem, especially when coupled with sea-level rise.

About 40 percent of the population of the United States lives in coastal counties, and many of the world's major cities are similarly close to the ocean. Even if the critics are right and the alarmist predictions from Hansen and colleagues aren't correct, we're not out of trouble.

","The article discusses a manuscript that is still under “open access” review, so naturally there is still significant (and public) discussion about the details among scientific reviewers. Overall the article is accurate, though some of the language is a little skewed. For example, the author says climate deniers “may not have science on their side,” but that should be “do not have science on their side.” Likewise, by calling Hansen’s work “alarmist predictions,” the author uses language that is common to climate deniers and introduces a subtle bias that is unfounded until the review process is complete. Nevertheless, the article is reasonable, and it correctly states that sea level rise is a real problem regardless of this particular Hansen publication.

","Ted Scambos, Senior Research Scientist, National Snow and Ice Data Center
","The article is accurate enough in its discussion of the threat, and the Hansen paper, but understates the nature of the concerning issues with the Hansen et al. extrapolation and concluding estimates. Hansen et al. estimates are based on a somewhat adhoc amplification of the contribution from the ice sheets based on the past two decades’ observations. If we have seen an approximate doubling every decade, then (having eight decades left in this century) we might anticipate at least a 2^8 (256-fold) increase in mass loss from the ice by 2100 – says Hansen et al. This ignores fundamental issues with the mechanics of this ice loss, e.g. in glacier speeds or in surface melt rates. This was discussed in part in an earlier paper by Pfeffer et al., in 2008.

","Rasmus Benestad, Meteorologisk Institutt","The article does not explain that the IPCC numbers tend to exclude collapse from landfast ice, wheras Hansen et al place a great deal of emphasis on land ice.

Analysis of “South Carolina flooding is the type of event climate scientists have warned about for years”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/andrew-freedman-south-carolina-flooding-climate-change/,South Carolina flooding is the type of event climate scientists have warned about for years,https://mashable.com/archive/south-carolina-floods-global-warming,"The epic amount of rain that led to deadly, catastrophic flooding across large parts of South Carolina and North Carolina is an example of exactly the type of supercharged storm system climate scientists have been warning about for years as a likely consequence of global warming. This storm, like others that have come before it -- from a massive deluge that flooded Oklahoma City to a flooding event in Houston, both of which occurred earlier this year -- are examples of how the atmosphere is behaving in new ways now that there's more water vapor and heat for weather systems to work with. [seealso url=""http://mashable.com/2015/10/04/columbia-flood-instagram/#7rmowljW2gqC""] It's not that heavy downpours and floods didn't occur before manmade global warming became evident (for the record, they did). The issue now is that these events are even more severe than they otherwise would have been. And they are becoming more frequent in many areas. Though there are significant limits on what climate scientists can say at this point about an event like the South Carolina floods, it's well-established that global warming has already led to a measurable increase in global atmospheric water vapor levels, and this moisture can be wrung out as heavier bursts of rain or snow. It is also well-established in scientific literature that precipitation is increasingly falling in short, intense bursts rather than long-lasting, generally lighter events.

The risk for extreme precipitation events is increasing in many parts of the world. One study, for example, showed that a 1-in-100 year winter-rainfall event in parts of the United Kingdom is already occurring more frequently, becoming a 1-in-80 year event. This means that an event with a 1% chance of occurring each year now has a 1.25% risk of occurring in any particular winter, which translates to a 25% increase in risk, according to Oxford University scientists.

While it's too soon to say precisely how global warming may have affected the rare confluence of events that conspired to dump at least 26.88 inches of rain in less than four days on South Carolina, changes in extreme precipitation events are one of global warming's most well-documented climate change impacts. First, consider how significant this rainfall event has been. Charleston and Columbia saw so much rain in four days that they both blew past their previous records for the all-time wettest October, along with setting numerous other milestones.

Across South Carolina, nearly 400 roads and 158 bridges were closed on Monday due to the flooding that killed nine. More than two dozen evacuation shelters are open, and 30,000 residents are still without power. [video id=c1NzExeDrZh0dAia4f71ppd3qcKOtonn] The record-shattering rains in Charleston and Columbia, as well as other parts of North and South Carolina, were rarer than a 1-in-1,000 year event, based on recurrence intervals from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This means that they'd have just a 0.1% chance or less of occurring in a given year.


As many climate scientists will say, though, we seem to be seeing more and more 500-year to 1,000-year events lately, to the point where the definition of such events and their return intervals may need to change.
How did this happen?
There were four main meteorological players in this extreme weather event, each of which raised the odds for a record rainfall event in the Carolinas and caused weather forecasters to sound the alarm for the Palmetto State as early as midweek last week. These atmospheric players include an upper-level low-pressure area across the Southeast; a stationary front with an area of low pressure riding along it; Hurricane Joaquin, which passed off the East Coast and moved close to Bermuda; as well as a strong area of high pressure parked across southern Quebec.These weather systems led to multiple moisture feeds directed at the Carolinas in firehose-like fashion for an unusually long time. Rainfall rates of 1-to-4 inches per hour or higher were recorded in the Charleston area and other locations for multiple hours at a time.

The creeping progress of the weather pattern, with the blocking high across Quebec playing a role in this, helped keep this firehose in place for days -- from Thursday through Monday. Some studies have shown that stuck weather patterns have become more common in recent years, potentially tied to rapid Arctic warming, though this link is not accepted by all of the mainstream climate science community. Think of some of these weather systems as pipelines directly connected to major moisture sources: the unusually mild waters of the tropical Pacific Ocean; milder-than-average waters of the western Atlantic; and a water-laden Hurricane Joaquin.
Climate change increases risk of extreme rainfall events
Across the U.S. as a whole, the frequency of 2-inch or greater rainstorms has increased in recent decades, and extreme precipitation events have been on the rise across the Northern Hemisphere as well. A Climate Central analysis released in May found that 40 of the lower 48 states have seen an overall increase in heavy downpours (the days where total precipitation exceeded the top 1% of all rain and snow days) since 1950. However, South Carolina was one of the few states that did not see an increase, based on that analysis. In fact, it saw a slight decrease in the frequency of heavy precipitation events. Neighboring states, including Georgia and North Carolina, did see increases, though.Sea Surface Temperature AnomalyIn general, warm air holds more moisture and evaporates more moisture from the soils and the ocean, which is also milder than it used to be. Ocean temperatures off the Southeast are above average for this time of year, which may have added more water vapor to this event, thereby giving the storm more energy to work with. Specific so-called ""climate attribution"" studies examining the role that global warming may have played in this event may take several weeks to months for scientists to complete. Michael Mann, who directs Earth Systems Science Center at Penn State University, told Mashable in an email that this storm is ""yet another example, like Sandy, or Irene, of weather on 'steroids,' another case where climate change worsened the effects of an already extreme meteorological event."" ""In this case, we’re seeing once-in-a-thousand year flooding along the South Carolina coastline as a consequence of the extreme supply of moisture streaming in from hurricane Joaquin,"" he said.East Coast Rainstorm South CarolinaJoaquin intensified over record warm sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic, which both allowed it to intensify rapidly despite adverse wind shear, and which provided it with unusually high levels of moisture -- moisture which is now being turned into record rainfall. Kevin Trenberth, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Colorado, is a prominent climate scientist who has been outspoken about tying global warming to the characteristics of extreme weather events. He has pointed out, in scientific papers and public appearances, that because global warming has added heat and moisture to the atmosphere, every weather event that occurs now is different than it would have been had it occurred several decades ago.APTOPIX East Coast Rainstorm South CarolinaFor example, this storm occurred during a year that has at least a 97% chance of being Earth's warmest on record, and at a time when the planet's oceans are the warmest they've been since such records began in the late 19th century. The tricky part for scientists lies in figuring out exactly how those changes manifest themselves, and how significant they are relative to other factors, such as natural climate variability. ""Global warming means more ocean heat and abundant surface water vapor waiting to be gathered by a storm,"" Trenberth wrote in an email to Mashable. A slow-moving storm such as this one, he said, ""dumps it all in one place."" ""This is increasingly occurring in different places and times and is to be expected from climate change,"" Trenberth said. He also cited the ongoing strong El Niño event in the tropical Pacific, which has helped drive global ocean temperatures to their highest temperature on record, as a possible factor behind this storm system. ""El Niño means all action is in [the] Pacific,"" which suppresses tropical storm and hurricane activity in the Atlantic. ""This means build up of heat that waits for an opportunity to escape in some sense."" Myles Allen, who leads the climate dynamics group at the University of Oxford and has participated in several climate attribution studies, was more cautious about linking the South Carolina extreme rainfall and flooding to global warming. ""All other things being equal, increasing atmospheric moisture resulting from large-scale warming would allow more such events to occur,"" he wrote in an email to Mashable. ""But other impacts of climate change, such as changing circulation patterns, could work in the opposite direction: so it’s an interesting question whether human influence on climate made this event more or less likely to occur, but not one on which we should jump to conclusions without doing the necessary analysis,"" he said.

Sea level rise makes matters worse
For coastal residents of the Carolinas, particularly those in Charleston, there was another climate change-related factor that helped accentuate the flooding: sea level rise. Onshore winds associated with the squeeze play between a surface low-pressure area in the Southeast and the high-pressure area over the northeast helped drive high tides in Charleston to levels not seen since Hurricane Hugo made landfall there in 1989.

This exacerbated flooding caused by heavy rain, since the tide level prevented waters and sewage from draining out of the city at times. According to Ben Strauss, a climate scientist at Climate Central who focuses on sea level rise, this flood event was a preview of what's to come for cities like Charleston as they face the prospect of more coastal flood events. ""This provides a mostly unrelated preview of what high tide could look like in Charleston after [the] sea level rise we could see later this century,"" Strauss wrote in an email.Charleston TideClimate Central's sea level rise report for South Carolina found that more than 800 square miles of land lie less than 4 feet above the high-tide line in South Carolina, including $24 billion in property value. ""Every coastal flood today is already wider, deeper and more damaging because of the roughly 8 inches of warming-driven global sea level rise that has taken place since 1900,"" the report found. ""Since sea level rise multiplies extreme coastal flood risk, and global warming contributes to sea level rise, global warming multiplies flood risk.""",high,"Accurate, Insightful",45,"This Mashable article does a good job at describing the relationship between the flooding in South Carolina and climate change. Long-term trends show an increase in the frequency of heavy downpours in the US, and this increase is consistent with the consequences of climate change. There is still debate, however, over attributing specific extreme rain events to climate change. Some scientists argue that by increasing the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, global warming has an impact on all extreme rain events. Not all scientists agree with this conclusion, however, and Andrew Freedman makes this clear in his article.

","I believe the article addresses our current understanding of the science and is a balanced response.
The article discussed the unique juxtaposition of an upper-level low and hurricane that was the direct cause of the event, but also directly addresses the role of the increase in atmospheric water vapor available for enhancing rainfall. The article also discusses the potential role of high latitude blocking highs (such as occurred with Hurricane Sandy), but, appropriately, does not dwell on that as a leading mechanism. I also appreciate the different perspectives on attribution studies and how they might apply to this situation.

","Water vapor content has increased in a warmer climate, and this is leading to more extreme rainfall events around the world.

"Analysis of “Wake up, Obama, climate change has been happening forever”",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/betsy-mccaughey-wake-up-obama-climate-change-has-been-happening-forever/,"Wake up, Obama, climate change has been happening forever",https://nypost.com/2015/09/07/wake-up-obama-climate-change-has-been-happening-forever/,"President Obama hiked to Exit Glacier in Alaska last week, with photographers in tow, to send the world a message: The glacier is melting.

Obama blames it on the increasing use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, which he wants to restrict not only in the United States but worldwide. The photo op was designed to build support for an international climate agreement he’s pushing hard to sell, so far with little success.

Trouble is, the president needs to get his facts straight. Exit Glacier has been shrinking for 200 years — since 1815 — long before widespread industrialization and automobiles. As the president ended his trip, he sounded the alarm again: “This state’s climate is changing before our eyes.”

News flash, Mr. President: Alaska has been buffeted by cyclical swings in climate for thousands of years. That’s true for the rest of the world, too. There was a 300-year-long Medieval heat wave, followed by a Little Ice Age that began around 1300, and then the 300-year warming period we’re in now.

The Anchorage Daily Times ran a front-page story in 1922 recording the “unheard-of temperatures” in the Arctic and glaciers disappearing. “The Arctic Ocean is warming up and icebergs are growing scarcer.”

Oblivious to the history of constant climate change, Obama pointed to Exit Glacier and said: “We want to make sure our grandkids can see this.”

He may get his wish, but it won’t be because of anything he’s doing. The current warming trend appears to be over, speculates Roger Cohen, a fellow of the American Physical Society. The Alaska Climate Research Center reports almost no evidence of warming trends in Alaska since 1977.

Many scientists are predicting the onset of two or three centuries of cooler weather — which would mean bigger glaciers. That’s despite the world’s growing use of fossil fuels. No matter what humans do, temperature trends go up, and then down; glaciers expand and then recede; sea levels rise and then fall, explains Will Happer, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton.

That doesn’t mean pollution controls are futile. We all want to breathe clean air. But don’t blame climate change on humans. There are bigger forces at work here.

Scientists disagree about what these forces are, and are researching better ways of accurately measuring temperature trends via satellite. Amid all this controversy and uncertainty about global climate change, Obama blindly insists that his theory of global warming “is beyond dispute” and attacks his critics as “deniers.”

Sounding more like an Old Testament doomsayer than a president, Obama warned in his Alaska speech that unless carbon fuels are restricted, “we will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair: Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields no longer growing.” Sounds scary, but he’s on thin ice backing up those predictions.

Despite Obama’s professed concern for the people of Alaska affected by climate change, his visit was more about theatrics than helping locals. Alaska’s Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski lambasted Obama’s job-killing new restrictions on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic. Obama says the region’s “very fragile,” but Murkowski is more worried that the economy is fragile. “It’s clear this administration does not care about us and sees us as nothing but a territory,” she said.

It’s a demonstration of Obama’s appalling lack of priorities. The president told his Alaska audience that “few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change.” Really, Mr. President? How about the epidemic of cop shootings in the United States, or the drowned toddlers washing up on Mediterranean shores as families flee the Middle East, or ISIS beheading thousands of Christians?

Obama says that with climate change, more than any other issue, “there is such a thing as being too late.” Tell that to a cop’s widow or the father who watched his family drown.",very_low,"Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",73,"The scientists unanimously qualify this article as misleading and flawed in its reasoning. The author asserts that “many scientists are predicting the onset of two or three centuries of cooler weather—which would mean bigger glaciers.” As the scientists point out, however, glaciologists have collected “crystal clear” evidence for accelerating glacier melt and retreat, which scientists overwhelmingly attribute to human-induced global warming, and scientific consensus warns that a continued rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will produce further global warming.
","This article seems to proclaim that because there is natural variability in climate, there can’t possibly be human-caused climate change. This is like saying that sea-level change cannot be due to ice loss, because sea level goes up and down every day with the tides, without ice melting.

The fact is that global temperatures keep rising, and the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere has reached a level that is unsurpassed during the time human civilization has existed. We are in the middle of conducting the greatest climate experiment. Uncertainties in models mean that we don’t know exact outcomes, but the forcing of greenhouse gases is understood sufficiently well that the risk of large changes in climate is very high.

Undoubtedly, natural variability means that there will be cooler trends that interrupt the general warming, but it also means that there will be times with unusually high rates of warming. Scientists who proclaim to know that we are heading into decades of cooling stand on very thin ground.

","This article is highly misleading and biased. It fails to recognise that scientists have good understanding of the ways in which climate change occurs and the ways in which we can differentiate between natural variability in the climate and climate change produced by human greenhouse gas emissions.
Obama was also correct in using Exit Glacier as an example of how contemporary climate change is leading to the retreat of glaciers. This pattern of glacier melt is seen in all of the world’s glaciated mountain regions. Arguing whether one glacier started its recession slightly earlier or slightly later than others is to miss the point.
The article also tries to suggest that Arctic warming is not new. What it fails to reveal though is that the recent warming covers the whole of the Arctic region; previous warming was much more regional.

Finally, the article claims that scientists are predicting a long period of global cooling. While climate change does not mean that all regions of the world will warm uniformly, the overwhelming scientific consensus is clear that a continued rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will produce continued global warming. This view is supported by all the world’s major academies of science and by the recent reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

","Betsy McCaughey incorrectly confuses the historically slow retreat of the Exit Glacier with its vastly more rapid retreat over the last 25 years. Manmade climate change is directly related to the historically unprecedented and rapid melt of Alaskan glaciers. Scientific study after study shows that most of the world’s glaciers are melting at an ever-increasing rate that cannot be explained by natural cycles alone. Only human activities could generate the speed-up in melt that we have observed over the last 25 years in Alaska and around the world. Glaciologists have collected tens of thousands of measurements from glaciers, dating back over 120 years, and the evidence of accelerating glacier melt and retreat in response to manmade warming is crystal clear. Any other conclusion is willfully ignoring the data, the facts, and the conclusions of the entire glaciological community. Ignoring this level of certainty about the human causes of melting of glaciers is analogous to believing that the Earth is flat, all evidence to the contrary.

","Alpine glaciers did retreat rapidly during the first half of the century, but not from 1950-1980 when many alpine glaciers including several in Glacier Bay, Alaska did advance. The volume of Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets was also stable during this period. Today, it is the ubiquitous and rapid volume loss on glaciers that is remarkable, and one of the many different lines of evidence that have convinced the vast majority of scientists that the current warming is caused by man. Glaciers in equatorial and arctic latitudes, wet and arid climates, large and small, ending in lakes or the ocean are almost all retreating. Out of the 250 glaciers I have worked on, at present 242 are retreating, six have disappeared and one is stationary.

 ","Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University
","This article rehashes a tired old argument that because natural forces have caused climate change in the past, current climate change is no big deal. In fact, every line of evidence now points to man-made greenhouse gas emissions as the primary driver of ongoing (and projected) climate change.
The article also tries to pin the “global warming theory” on president Obama, while the reality is that it reflects the consensus diagnosis of the climate science community.

","Contrary to overwhelming scientific evidence and conclusions of the vast majority of climate scientists, the article claims that climate will be cooling in the future and that the recently observed warming is not caused by humans. It is misleading in suggesting uncertainty and doubt about human causes of climate change, whereas in reality there is very little uncertainty and doubt on that point.

Analysis of “Deceptive temperature record claims”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/tom-harris-deceptive-temperature-record-claims/,Deceptive temperature record claims,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/23/tom-harris-global-warming-deceptive-temperature-re/,"The U.S. government is at it again, hyping meaningless records in a parameter that does not exist in order to frighten us about something that doesn’t matter.

NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced this week that according to their calculations, July 2015 was the hottest month since instrumental records began in 1880. NOAA says that the record was set by eight one-hundredths of a degree Celsius over that set in July 1998. NASA calculates that July 2015 beat what they assert was the previous warmest month (July 2011) by two one-hundredths of a degree.

But government spokespeople rarely mention the inconvenient fact that these records are being set by less than the uncertainty in the statistics. NOAA claims an uncertainty of 14 one-hundredths of a degree in its temperature averages, or near twice the amount by which they say the record was set. NASA says that their data is typically accurate to one tenth of a degree, five times the amount by which their new record was set.

So, the new temperature records are meaningless. Neither agency knows whether a record was set.

Such misrepresentations are now commonplace in NOAA and NASA announcements. They are regularly proclaiming monthly and yearly records set by less than the uncertainties in the measurements. Scientists within the agencies know that this is dishonest.

They also know that calculating so-called global average temperatures to hundredths of a degree is irrational. After all, there is very little data for the 70 percent of Earth’s surface that is ocean. There is also little data for mountainous and desert regions, not to mention the Antarctic. Much of the coverage is so sparse that NASA is forced to make the ridiculous claim that regions are adequately covered if there is a temperature-sensing station within nearly 750 miles. This is the distance between Ottawa, Canada, and Myrtle Beach, S.C. cities with very different climates. Yet, according to NASA, only one temperature sensing station is necessary for the two cities and the vast area between them to be adequately represented in their network.

In the final analysis, it is no more meaningful to calculate an average temperature for a whole planet than it is to calculate the average telephone number in the Washington D.C. phone book. Temperature, like viscosity and density, and of course phone numbers, is not something that can be meaningfully averaged. “Global temperature” does not exist.

In their award winning book, “Taken By Storm” (2007), Canadian researchers Christopher Essex and Ross McKitrick explain: “Temperature is not an amount of something [like height or weight]. It is a number that represents the condition of a physical system. In thermodynamics it is known as an intensive quantity, in contrast to quantities like energy, which have an additive property, which we call extensive in thermodynamics.”

Even if enough accurate surface temperature measurements existed to ensure reasonable planetary coverage (it doesn’t) and to calculate some sort of global temperature statistic, interpreting its significance would be challenging. What averaging rule would you use to handle the data from thousands of temperature-sensing stations? Mean, mode, median, root mean square? Science does not tell us. For some groups of close temperature measures (and NASA and NOAA are dealing with thousands of very close temperatures), one method of calculating an average can lead to a determination of warming while another can lead to a conclusion of cooling.

Even if you could calculate some sort of meaningful global temperature statistic, the figure would be unimportant. No one and nothing would experience it directly since we all live in regions, not the globe. There is no super-sized being straddling the planet, feeling global averages in temperature. Global warming does not matter.

Future generations are bound to ask why America closed its coal-fueled generating stations, its cheapest, most plentiful source of electric power, and wasted billions of dollars trying to stop insignificant changes in imaginary phenomena.

The sad answer will be that it had nothing to do with the realities of science, technology or economics. The tragic blunder is based on satisfying political expedience for a privileged few, egged on by vested financial interests, and supported by largely uninformed activists granted the media platforms needed to sway public opinion. As Jay Lehr, science director of the Chicago-based Heartland Institute said, “It is a scam that dwarfs all others that have come before.”

","One of the reasons why climatologists prefer to work with “anomalies”, deviations from the typical climate, is that anomalies are similar over large regions, especially when it comes to averages over longer periods. I guess everyone still remembers that last winter the entire East Coast was colder than usual, while the West Coast was warmer than usual.

Thus while it naturally was absolutely warmer in the South, regions of the East coast with different climates still had similar temperature anomalies, this is why a station at a given point is representative of the temperature anomaly in a large region around that point.
","This is an old skeptic talking point that has been discussed a thousand times. The basic point is the difference between temperature anomalies and absolute temperatures. See for instance this NASA webpage, which indicates: “The GISTEMP analysis concerns only temperature anomalies, not absolute temperature. Temperature anomalies are computed relative to the base period 1951-1980. The reason to work with anomalies, rather than absolute temperature is that absolute temperature varies markedly in short distances, while monthly or annual temperature anomalies are representative of a much larger region. Indeed, we have shown (Hansen and Lebedeff, 1987) that temperature anomalies are strongly correlated out to distances of the order of 1000 km.”

See also this article by Real Climate : “the basic issue is that temperature anomalies have a much greater correlation scale (100’s of miles) than absolute temperatures – i.e. if the monthly anomaly in upstate New York is a 2ºC, that is a good estimate for the anomaly from Ohio to Maine, and from Quebec to Maryland, while the absolute temperature would vary far more. That means you need fewer data points to make a good estimate of the global value.”",,,"“In their award winning book, ‘Taken By Storm’ (2007), Canadian researchers Christopher Essex and Ross McKitrick explain: ‘Temperature is not an amount of something [like height or weight]. It is a number that represents the condition of a physical system. In thermodynamics it is known as an intensive quantity, in contrast to quantities like energy, which have an additive property, which we call extensive in thermodynamics.’”
","Temperature and heat (energy) content are closely related such that the heat content is the temperature times the specific heat capacity and the density. Because the specific heat capacity is a constant and density variations are small compared to temperature variations the heat content is typically very closely related to the temperature of the air in the atmosphere or the water in the oceans. Thus, while this citation of Essex and McKitrick is a correct statement about the principles of thermodynamics, its use here is misleading because it does not acknowledge the close relationship between temperature and energy in practical climate applications.",,,,"“Temperature, like viscosity and density, and of course phone numbers, is not something that can be meaningfully averaged. ‘Global temperature’ does not exist.”
","According to this line of argument, one could not talk about human body temperature, because the temperature of someone’s feet is not the same as, say, their belly. Yet I am sure Mr. Harris accepts the medical relevance of the concept of fever (or hypothermia)…

","A measured temperature is always an average over time and space. The thermometer is not infinitely fast and probes a finite space.
If Harris were right, you could no longer say something as simple as your bedroom being cooler than your living room. Or the Moon being colder than the Earth.",,,"“Even if you could calculate some sort of meaningful global temperature statistic, the figure would be unimportant. No one and nothing would experience it directly since we all live in regions, not the globe. There is no super-sized being straddling the planet, feeling global averages in temperature. Global warming does not matter.”

","This is nonsense. What about the last ice age, when global temperature was estimated to be a handful of degrees (C) lower than today, and half of North America and Europe were under huge ice sheets?
Of course for large changes regional temperatures are tied to the global temperature. Almost all regions are currently warming with global warming at present, and are projected to do so with further warming. Note that warming is indeed “global”, but not every place is warming at the same rate, and some few places might even experience negative trends for now (e.g., Southeast US, North Atlantic – see below, or also here).
Also note that as this supposedly irrelevant global temperature is rising, a host of associated metrics/impacts are following suit: sea level is rising, ice sheets, sea ice, permafrost and glaciers are melting, species are migrating, etc.

"Analysis of “El Niño, explained: Why this year’s could be one of the strongest on record”",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/brad-plumer-el-nino-explained-why-this-years-could-be-one-of-the-strongest-on-record/,"El Niño, explained: Why this year’s could be one of the strongest on record",https://www.vox.com/2015/8/17/9164499/el-nino-2015,"Over the past year, scientists have been keeping a close eye on an important swath of the Pacific Ocean, just along the equator. When conditions here get just right, an El Niño can form — wreaking havoc on weather patterns across the globe.

The El Niño currently brewing in the Pacific is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever recorded. This phenomenon is expected to peak before January, with far-reaching impacts all winter and spring. Based on past experience, El Niño could potentially bring much-needed rain to California, but also drought in Australia, destructive floods in Peru, and so on. El Niño has already helped make 2015 the hottest year on record — and might well do the same for 2016.

That said, El Niño events are often unpredictable and full of surprises. So what follows is a guide to how El Niño works, what we know about the 2015 event, and how a potentially massive El Niño could upend the world's weather over the coming months.

A very basic definition of El Niño
El Niño is a weather phenomenon that occurs irregularly in the eastern tropical Pacific every two to seven years. When the trade winds that usually blow from east to west weaken, sea surface temperatures start rising, setting off a chain of atmospheric impacts.
El Niños can be strong or weak. Strong events can temporarily disrupt weather patterns around the world, typically making certain regions wetter (Peru or California, say) and others drier (Southeast Asia). Some countries suffer major damage as a result.
El Niños also transfer heat stored in the deeper layers of the ocean to the surface. When combined with global warming, that can lead to record hot years, as in 1998.
""El Niño"" got its name in the 1800s from Peruvian fisherman, who first noticed a mysterious warm current that would appear around Christmas. They called it the ""little boy"" or ""Christ child.""
Why this year's El Niño is a huge deal
The last truly massive El Niño appeared in 1997-'98 and ended up causing an estimated $35 billion in destruction and 23,000 deaths around the world. (It also inspired that famous Chris Farley sketch.) Now we're facing a similarly massive event:That, in itself, is a surprise. Back in March, NOAA's Climate Prediction Center announced that a weak El Niño had formed in the Pacific, but many experts initially thought it might fizzle out by summer. Instead, this El Niño kept strengthening, with ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific continuing to soar. By mid-November, temperatures in one critical part of the ocean, the Niño 3.4 region, were running even hotter than they were in 1997:

""Right now we say we think it's really going to be one of the three strongest ones,"" said Michel Jarraud, the secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, who compared it with the 1997-98, 1982-83, and 1972-73 El Niño events. ""It may be one of the two; that we don't know yet. But definitely it's already a very strong one.""

Countries across the globe will have to brace themselves as this event peaks this winter and lasts through the spring. El Niño has already triggered longer droughts in Indonesia, enabling massive man-made peatland fires to rage out of control, creating toxic haze that has spread as far as Singapore. Warmer ocean temperatures have also caused a major coral bleaching event, harming reefs around the world.

And El Niño may just be getting started: In the past, major events have brought unusually hot, dry weather to Australia that can cramp wheat yields and amp up wildfires. It can bring hotter, drier weather to India that hurts agriculture. It can bring heavy rain and destructive flooding to Peru, washing away houses and spreading cholera.

That said, El Niño isn't all bad. In the United States, it could bring some needed rain this winter to ease California's drought (though also deadly mudslides and flooding). Historically, El Niño has also served up milder US winters and tamped down on Atlantic hurricanes.

One important caveat, however, is that every El Niño unfolds a bit differently — and some have unexpected impacts. As NOAA's Emily Becker points out, strong El Niño events usually bring rain to California in the winter (as in 1982-'83), but occasionally they don't (as in 1965-'66):

Another key story to watch is how a strong El Niño might push up temperatures worldwide. Global average temperatures are already going up over time, thanks to all the carbon dioxide we're adding to the atmosphere. According to NASA, 2014 was the hottest year on record. But there was no El Niño that year — and El Niño years tend to be a bit hotter than average, as heat gets transferred from the ocean to the surface.

The combination of El Niño and rising CO2 is already helping 2015 shatter heat records. The big question now is whether it'll do the same for 2016:

Bottom line: There are still a lot of question marks about how this will unfold. But El Niño could well be the biggest weather story of the next several months, with ripple effects around the globe.

How El Niño actually works, step by step
To see how El Niño works, it helps to understand what the equatorial Pacific looks like under normal, or ""neutral,"" conditions:

1) Neutral conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean
Normally, the tropical Pacific features strong trade winds that blow warm ocean water from east to west, where it piles up near Indonesia. Meanwhile, back east along South America, frigid water deep down in the ocean gets pulled up closer to the surface, cooling the area around Peru. Here's a diagram:

As a result, during ""neutral"" conditions, sea levels are about half a meter higher near Indonesia than they are in Peru. And the surface water near Indonesia is about 8°C warmer (14.4°F) than it is near Peru. That temperature difference creates a convective loop in the atmosphere that, in turn, reinforces the trade winds.

This ends up affecting a lot more than just this stretch of ocean. Because the Pacific is so vast, this system is a major driving force in the global climate. The large, warm pool of water near Indonesia causes the air above it to rise, creating rainfall in the region. And this system shapes the jet streams that guide weather and storms around the world.

That's how it works under normal conditions, anyway. But things look a little different when El Niño comes along.

2) Now along comes El Niño
Every few years, those prevailing Pacific trade winds that blow east to west can weaken. (Scientists are still debating the nuances of exactly why this happens.)

When the trade winds weaken, all that warm water that was piled up near Indonesia starts sloshing back eastward, pulled back down by gravity. What's more, the underwater layer known as the thermocline starts sinking. As a result, there's less cold water rising up from the deep ocean near South America — so the waters near Peru start warming up. Here's another diagram:

This causes sea surface temperatures in the east and central Pacific to start rising and the trade winds to weaken even further. What's more, rainfall starts following that warm pool of water as it travels eastward. That's why El Niño is usually associated with drier weather in places like Indonesia and Australia, as well as heavier rains in places like Peru (or California). The rain is essentially moving east.

Scientists officially declare an El Niño when sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean (known as the Niño 3.4 region) rise 0.5°C above their historical baseline for three months in a row — and once atmospheric conditions and rainfall patterns shift accordingly.

Again, because the Pacific is so vast, an El Niño can have large ripple effects on weather around the world, especially during the winter months. Here's a look at the changes that have historically accompanied El Niño events:

Typical effects of an El Niño during the winter:

A strong El Niño can weaken monsoons in the Indian Ocean, for example. It can also cause the jet stream to start stretching from the Eastern Pacific across the southern United States, bringing rainfall and storms with it. Still, a lot depends on how strong the El Niño actually is — and occasionally there are aberrations and exceptions to the rule. More on that below.

El Niño's return in 2015 — and why scientists have been talking about a ""Godzilla"" event
Ever since early 2014, scientists have been expecting this latest El Niño to form. But, in a sign of how slippery the system can be, El Niño kept defying predictions and not showing up.

Finally, in March 2015, after several false starts, scientists at NOAA's climate prediction center were ready to declare that a weak El Niño was underway. Specifically, sea surface temperatures in that Niño 3.4 region (roughly in the center of the chart below) had been at least 0.5°C above their baseline since September. And, importantly, atmospheric conditions were responding in turn, with more rain over the central Pacific and less rain over Indonesia:

At the time, however, NOAA's forecasters said that this El Niño looked ""weak,"" with possibly minimal effects on global weather patterns, and only had a 50 to 60 percent chance of lasting through the summer.

Then, somewhat unexpectedly, El Niño kept getting stronger and stronger. And stronger. By October 2015, sea surface temperatures had soared to more than 2°C above baseline in the Niño 3.4 region, and scientists were seeing strong telltale atmospheric changes. Notice how the anomalous warm area has moved east and is much, much warmer than usual:

Forecasters now expect this El Niño to peak between October and January, and when it does, it's likely to rank among the two or three strongest ever record (along with 1997-'98, 1982-'83, and 1972-'73.) Some forecasters have even dubbed this one a potential ""Godzilla.""

We're already started to see some major El Niño impacts around the world. A paucity of rainfall in Indonesia this fall allowed manmade forest and peat fires to rage out of control, choking the region in a thick toxic haze. And the warmer Pacific waters have fostered an unusually active tropical cyclone season, a hallmark of El Niño. On the flip side, however, the event has also fostered more wind shear in the Atlantic that has curtailed hurricane activity there.

El Niño could bring rain to California — but may not end the drought
As noted above, El Niño tends to be associated with changes in weather patterns around the world, especially during the Northern Hemisphere winter. One tantalizing possibility is that a strong El Niño will bring more rain to California, alleviating the state's drought.

But even here, nothing is certain. El Niño only affects US weather indirectly, by altering atmospheric circulation and shifting the North Pacific jet stream. (See here for a lucid explanation by Columbia University's Anthony Barnston.) This is an intricate chain of events, and small kinks at certain points can affect the ultimate outcome.

As such, Becker cautions people to think not in terms of certainties but in terms of probabilities. Here's an example of how El Niño might shift the odds of a wetter-than-average winter for California (she notes that this isn't a prediction, just an illustration):

In other words, thanks to El Niño, California has a greater chance of a wetter winter, but not a 100 percent chance.

What's more, even if rain does come, that may not be enough to completely erase the massive water deficit that California has built up over the past five years. The state likely needs record precipitation to end the drought, and it also needs the right mix of rain (to recharge the reservoirs) and snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains (to melt during the spring and summer).

Also, be warned: Heavy rain after a drought can bring floods and mudslides. Southern California got a possible preview in mid-October, when a short burst of intense rains led to major mudflows that trapped hundreds of cars. So people need to be ready.

El Niño tends to hurt some countries and benefit others
It's not quite right to say that El Niño events are ""bad"" or ""good."" They tend to have different impacts on different regions.

One recent study from the University of Cambridge found that on average, El Niño events hurt economic activity in Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. The reasons varied: drought and reduced crop yields in Australia and India, forest fires in Indonesia, less productive fisheries in Peru.

But that study also found that on average, El Niño tended to boost the economies in Argentina, Canada, Mexico, and even the United States, at least in the very short term. Again, many factors were at play: In addition to bringing needed rain to California and Texas, El Niño was associated with less tornado activity in the midwestern United States and fewer hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean.

Here's a table of the estimated economic impacts on a broad selection of countries:

Again, every big El Niño is different and has its own idiosyncrasies. So think of this table as more a rough guide than gospel.

There are also two important twists here. As the WMO's Michel Jarraud stressed in his October news conference, many countries have learned from the past and implemented measures to guard against El Niño's impacts. (Mexico, for instance, was well-prepared for a record-strength Pacific hurricane that hit the state last month.)

Conversely, this El Niño is also playing out in the context of record warm ocean temperatures, so it could have unpredictable impacts. ""Our scientific understanding of El Niño has increased greatly in recent years. However, this event is playing out in uncharted territory,"" said Jarraud. ""This naturally occurring El Niño event and human induced climate change may interact and modify each other in ways which we have never before experienced.""

El Niño is helping make 2015 a record hot year. What about 2016?
Thanks to global warming, the Earth's average surface temperature has been going up over time. But there's a lot of variation from year to year. El Niño years tend to be a bit hotter than average. La Niña years (when those trade winds strengthen rather than weaken) tend to be a bit cooler than average. Like so:

What's going on here? As humans load more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, we're trapping more and more heat on the Earth's surface. But more than 90 percent of that extra heat is absorbed by the oceans. So subtle interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere can make a big difference for surface temperatures.

When conditions in the Pacific are neutral, more of that heat is trapped beneath the ocean surface. When a strong El Niño forms, more of that heat is transferred to the surface. That's why the Earth's average surface temperatures reached new highs in 1998: You had the combination of global warming and an extremely strong El Niño.

What was remarkable about 2014 is that it was likely the hottest year on record even without an El Niño event — a sign that Earth keeps getting warmer overall. Meanwhile, 2015 is basically guaranteed to be even hotter than 2014.

Now throw a monster El Niño into the mix, and we're looking at a potential shattering of records. Back in January, NASA's Gavin Schmidt explained at a press conference that temperatures typically peak about three months after an El Niño event. Given that forecasters expect this current El Niño to last until next spring, it's entirely possible we could see 2016 also set new highs. We'll have to wait and see.","very_high, high","Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",10,"Scientists unanimously qualify this article as accurate and informative.

Predicting climate months in advance is about making bets (favoring certain odds) because no impact is ever guaranteed. With that said, this upcoming winter will likely be quite interesting!

Some snapshots: In just the past few months, record-setting heat waves in Pakistan and India each killed more than 1,000 people. In Washington state’s Olympic National Park, the rainforest caught fire for the first time in living memory. London reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest July day ever recorded in the U.K.; The Guardian briefly had to pause its live blog of the heat wave because its computer servers overheated. In California, suffering from its worst drought in a millennium, a 50-acre brush fire swelled seventyfold in a matter of hours, jumping across the I-15 freeway during rush-hour traffic. Then, a few days later, the region was pounded by intense, virtually unheard-of summer rains. Puerto Rico is under its strictest water rationing in history as a monster El Niño forms in the tropical Pacific Ocean, shifting weather patterns worldwide.

On July 20th, James Hansen, the former NASA climatologist who brought climate change to the public’s attention in the summer of 1988, issued a bombshell: He and a team of climate scientists had identified a newly important feedback mechanism off the coast of Antarctica that suggests mean sea levels could rise 10 times faster than previously predicted: 10 feet by 2065. The authors included this chilling warning: If emissions aren’t cut, “We conclude that multi-meter sea-level rise would become practically unavoidable. Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.”

Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at NASA and the University of California-Irvine and a co-author on Hansen’s study, said their new research doesn’t necessarily change the worst-case scenario on sea-level rise, it just makes it much more pressing to think about and discuss, especially among world leaders. In particular, says Rignot, the new research shows a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “safe” level of climate change — “would be a catastrophe for sea-level rise.”

Hansen’s new study also shows how complicated and unpredictable climate change can be. Even as global ocean temperatures rise to their highest levels in recorded history, some parts of the ocean, near where ice is melting exceptionally fast, are actually cooling, slowing ocean circulation currents and sending weather patterns into a frenzy. Sure enough, a persistently cold patch of ocean is starting to show up just south of Greenland, exactly where previous experimental predictions of a sudden surge of freshwater from melting ice expected it to be. Michael Mann, another prominent climate scientist, recently said of the unexpectedly sudden Atlantic slowdown, “This is yet another example of where observations suggest that climate model predictions may be too conservative when it comes to the pace at which certain aspects of climate change are proceeding.”

Since storm systems and jet streams in the United States and Europe partially draw their energy from the difference in ocean temperatures, the implication of one patch of ocean cooling while the rest of the ocean warms is profound. Storms will get stronger, and sea-level rise will accelerate. Scientists like Hansen only expect extreme weather to get worse in the years to come, though Mann said it was still “unclear” whether recent severe winters on the East Coast are connected to the phenomenon.

And yet, these aren’t even the most disturbing changes happening to the Earth’s biosphere that climate scientists are discovering this year. For that, you have to look not at the rising sea levels but to what is actually happening within the oceans themselves.

Water temperatures this year in the North Pacific have never been this high for this long over such a large area — and it is already having a profound effect on marine life.

Eighty-year-old Roger Thomas runs whale-watching trips out of San Francisco. On an excursion earlier this year, Thomas spotted 25 humpbacks and three blue whales. During a survey on July 4th, federal officials spotted 115 whales in a single hour near the Farallon Islands — enough to issue a boating warning. Humpbacks are occasionally seen offshore in California, but rarely so close to the coast or in such numbers. Why are they coming so close to shore? Exceptionally warm water has concentrated the krill and anchovies they feed on into a narrow band of relatively cool coastal water. The whales are having a heyday. “It’s unbelievable,” Thomas told a local paper. “Whales are all over
the place.”

Last fall, in northern Alaska, in the same part of the Arctic where Shell is planning to drill for oil, federal scientists discovered 35,000 walruses congregating on a single beach. It was the largest-ever documented “haul out” of walruses, and a sign that sea ice, their favored habitat, is becoming harder and harder to find.

Marine life is moving north, adapting in real time to the warming ocean. Great white sharks have been sighted breeding near Monterey Bay, California, the farthest north that’s ever been known to occur. A blue marlin was caught last summer near Catalina Island — 1,000 miles north of its typical range. Across California, there have been sightings of non-native animals moving north, such as Mexican red crabs.

No species may be as uniquely endangered as the one most associated with the Pacific Northwest, the salmon. Every two weeks, Bill Peterson, an oceanographer and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Oregon, takes to the sea to collect data he uses to forecast the return of salmon. What he’s been seeing this year is deeply troubling.

Salmon are crucial to their coastal ecosystem like perhaps few other species on the planet. A significant portion of the nitrogen in West Coast forests has been traced back to salmon, which can travel hundreds of miles upstream to lay their eggs. The largest trees on Earth simply wouldn’t exist without salmon.

But their situation is precarious. This year, officials in California are bringing salmon downstream in convoys of trucks, because river levels are too low and the temperatures too warm for them to have a reasonable chance of surviving. One species, the winter-run Chinook salmon, is at a particularly increased risk of decline in the next few years, should the warm water persist offshore.

“You talk to fishermen, and they all say: ‘We’ve never seen anything like this before,’ ” says Peterson. “So when you have no experience with something like this, it gets like, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ “

Atmospheric scientists increasingly believe that the exceptionally warm waters over the past months are the early indications of a phase shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a cyclical warming of the North Pacific that happens a few times each century. Positive phases of the PDO have been known to last for 15 to 20 years, during which global warming can increase at double the rate as during negative phases of the PDO. It also makes big El Niños, like this year’s, more likely. The nature of PDO phase shifts is unpredictable — climate scientists simply haven’t yet figured out precisely what’s behind them and why they happen when they do. It’s not a permanent change — the ocean’s temperature will likely drop from these record highs, at least temporarily, some time over the next few years — but the impact on marine species will be lasting, and scientists have pointed to the PDO as a global-warming preview.

“The climate [change] models predict this gentle, slow increase in temperature,” says Peterson, “but the main problem we’ve had for the last few years is the variability is so high. As scientists, we can’t keep up with it, and neither can the animals.” Peterson likens it to a boxer getting pummeled round after round: “At some point, you knock them down, and the fight is over.” 

Attendant with this weird wildlife behavior is a stunning drop in the number of plankton — the basis of the ocean’s food chain. In July, another major study concluded that acidifying oceans are likely to have a “quite traumatic” impact on plankton diversity, with some species dying out while others flourish. As the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it’s converted into carbonic acid — and the pH of seawater declines. According to lead author Stephanie Dutkiewicz of MIT, that trend means “the whole food chain is going to be different.”

The Hansen study may have gotten more attention, but the Dutkiewicz study, and others like it, could have even more dire implications for our future. The rapid changes Dutkiewicz and her colleagues are observing have shocked some of their fellow scientists into thinking that yes, actually, we’re heading toward the worst-case scenario. Unlike a prediction of massive sea-level rise just decades away, the warming and acidifying oceans represent a problem that seems to have kick-started a mass extinction on the same time scale.

Jacquelyn Gill is a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. She knows a lot about extinction, and her work is more relevant than ever. Essentially, she’s trying to save the species that are alive right now by learning more about what killed off the ones that aren’t. The ancient data she studies shows “really compelling evidence that there can be events of abrupt climate change that can happen well within human life spans. We’re talking less than a decade.”

For the past year or two, a persistent change in winds over the North Pacific has given rise to what meteorologists and oceanographers are calling “the blob” — a highly anomalous patch of warm water between Hawaii, Alaska and Baja California that’s thrown the marine ecosystem into a tailspin. Amid warmer temperatures, plankton numbers have plummeted, and the myriad species that depend on them have migrated or seen their own numbers dwindle.

Significant northward surges of warm water have happened before, even frequently. El Niño, for example, does this on a predictable basis. But what’s happening this year appears to be something new. Some climate scientists think that the wind shift is linked to the rapid decline in Arctic sea ice over the past few years, which separate research has shown makes weather patterns more likely to get stuck.

A similar shift in the behavior of the jet stream has also contributed to the California drought and severe polar vortex winters in the Northeast over the past two years. An amplified jet-stream pattern has produced an unusual doldrum off the West Coast that’s persisted for most of the past 18 months. Daniel Swain, a Stanford University meteorologist, has called it the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge” — weather patterns just aren’t supposed to last this long.

What’s increasingly uncontroversial among scientists is that in many ecosystems, the impacts of the current off-the-charts temperatures in the North Pacific will linger for years, or longer. The largest ocean on Earth, the Pacific is exhibiting cyclical variability to greater extremes than other ocean basins. While the North Pacific is currently the most dramatic area of change in the world’s oceans, it’s not alone: Globally, 2014 was a record-setting year for ocean temperatures, and 2015 is on pace to beat it soundly, boosted by the El Niño in the Pacific. Six percent of the world’s reefs could disappear before the end of the decade, perhaps permanently, thanks to warming waters.

Since warmer oceans expand in volume, it’s also leading to a surge in sea-level rise. One recent study showed a slowdown in Atlantic Ocean currents, perhaps linked to glacial melt from Greenland, that caused a four-inch rise in sea levels along the Northeast coast in just two years, from 2009 to 2010. To be sure, it seems like this sudden and unpredicted surge was only temporary, but scientists who studied the surge estimated it to be a 1-in-850-year event, and it’s been blamed on accelerated beach erosion “almost as significant as some hurricane events.” 

Possibly worse than rising ocean temperatures is the acidification of the waters. Acidification has a direct effect on mollusks and other marine animals with hard outer bodies: A striking study last year showed that, along the West Coast, the shells of tiny snails are already dissolving, with as-yet-unknown consequences on the ecosystem. One of the study’s authors, Nina Bednaršek, told Science magazine that the snails’ shells, pitted by the acidifying ocean, resembled “cauliflower” or “sandpaper.” A similarly striking study by more than a dozen of the world’s top ocean scientists this July said that the current pace of increasing carbon emissions would force an “effectively irreversible” change on ocean ecosystems during this century. In as little as a decade, the study suggested, chemical changes will rise significantly above background levels in nearly half of the world’s oceans.

“I used to think it was kind of hard to make things in the ocean go extinct,” James Barry of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California told the Seattle Times in 2013. “But this change we’re seeing is happening so fast it’s almost instantaneous.” 

Thanks to the pressure we’re putting on the planet’s ecosystem — warming, acidification and good old-fashioned pollution — the oceans are set up for several decades of rapid change. Here’s what could happen next.

The combination of excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff, abnormal wind patterns and the warming oceans is already creating seasonal dead zones in coastal regions when algae blooms suck up most of the available oxygen. The appearance of low-oxygen regions has doubled in frequency every 10 years since 1960 and should continue to grow over the coming decades at an even greater rate.

So far, dead zones have remained mostly close to the coasts, but in the 21st century, deep-ocean dead zones could become common. These low-oxygen regions could gradually expand in size — potentially thousands of miles across — which would force fish, whales, pretty much everything upward. If this were to occur, large sections of the temperate deep oceans would suffer should the oxygen-free layer grow so pronounced that it stratifies, pushing surface ocean warming into overdrive and hindering upwelling of cooler, nutrient-rich deeper water.

Enhanced evaporation from the warmer oceans will create heavier downpours, perhaps destabilizing the root systems of forests, and accelerated runoff will pour more excess nutrients into coastal areas, further enhancing dead zones. In the past year, downpours have broken records in Long Island, Phoenix, Detroit, Baltimore, Houston and Pensacola, Florida.

Evidence for the above scenario comes in large part from our best understanding of what happened 250 million years ago, during the “Great Dying,” when more than 90 percent of all oceanic species perished after a pulse of carbon dioxide and methane from land-based sources began a period of profound climate change. The conditions that triggered “Great Dying” took hundreds of thousands of years to develop. But humans have been emitting carbon dioxide at a much quicker rate, so the current mass extinction only took 100 years or so to kick-start.

With all these stressors working against it, a hypoxic feedback loop could wind up destroying some of the oceans’ most species-rich ecosystems within our lifetime. A recent study by Sarah Moffitt of the University of California-Davis said it could take the ocean thousands of years to recover. “Looking forward for my kid, people in the future are not going to have the same ocean that I have today,” Moffitt said.

As you might expect, having tickets to the front row of a global environmental catastrophe is taking an increasingly emotional toll on scientists, and in some cases pushing them toward advocacy. Of the two dozen or so scientists I interviewed for this piece, virtually all drifted into apocalyptic language at some point.

For Simone Alin, an oceanographer focusing on ocean acidification at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, the changes she’s seeing hit close to home. The Puget Sound is a natural laboratory for the coming decades of rapid change because its waters are naturally more acidified than most of the world’s marine ecosystems.

The local oyster industry here is already seeing serious impacts from acidifying waters and is going to great lengths to avoid a total collapse. Alin calls oysters, which are non-native, the canary in the coal mine for the Puget Sound: “A canary is also not native to a coal mine, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good indicator of change.”

Though she works on fundamental oceanic changes every day, the Dutkiewicz study on the impending large-scale changes to plankton caught her off-guard: “This was alarming to me because if the basis of the food web changes, then . . . everything could change, right?”

Alin’s frank discussion of the looming oceanic apocalypse is perhaps a product of studying unfathomable change every day. But four years ago, the birth of her twins “heightened the whole issue,” she says. “I was worried enough about these problems before having kids that I maybe wondered whether it was a good idea. Now, it just makes me feel crushed.” 

Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and evangelical Christian, moved from Canada to Texas with her husband, a pastor, precisely because of its vulnerability to climate change. There, she engages with the evangelical community on science — almost as a missionary would. But she’s already planning her exit strategy: “If we continue on our current pathway, Canada will be home for us long term. But the majority of people don’t have an exit strategy. . . . So that’s who I’m here trying to help.”

James Hansen, the dean of climate scientists, retired from NASA in 2013 to become a climate activist. But for all the gloom of the report he just put his name to, Hansen is actually somewhat hopeful. That’s because he knows that climate change has a straightforward solution: End fossil-fuel use as quickly as possible. If tomorrow, the leaders of the United States and China would agree to a sufficiently strong, coordinated carbon tax that’s also applied to imports, the rest of the world would have no choice but to sign up. This idea has already been pitched to Congress several times, with tepid bipartisan support. Even though a carbon tax is probably a long shot, for Hansen, even the slim possibility that bold action like this might happen is enough for him to devote the rest of his life to working to achieve it. On a conference call with reporters in July, Hansen said a potential joint U.S.-China carbon tax is more important than whatever happens at the United Nations climate talks in Paris.

One group Hansen is helping is Our Children’s Trust, a legal advocacy organization that’s filed a number of novel challenges on behalf of minors under the idea that climate change is a violation of intergenerational equity — children, the group argues, are lawfully entitled to inherit a healthy planet.

A separate challenge to U.S. law is being brought by a former EPA scientist arguing that carbon dioxide isn’t just a pollutant (which, under the Clean Air Act, can dissipate on its own), it’s also a toxic substance. In general, these substances have exceptionally long life spans in the environment, cause an unreasonable risk, and therefore require remediation. In this case, remediation may involve planting vast numbers of trees or restoring wetlands to bury excess carbon underground.

Even if these novel challenges succeed, it will take years before a bend in the curve is noticeable. But maybe that’s enough. When all feels lost, saving a few species will feel like a triumph.

Analysis of “How Arctic ice has made fools of all those poor warmists”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-telegraph-christopher-booker-arctic-ice-has-made-fools-of-warmists/,How Arctic ice has made fools of all those poor warmists,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11763272/How-Arctic-ice-has-made-fools-of-all-those-poor-warmists.html,"Two events last week brought yet further twists to one of the longest-running farces of our modern world. One was the revelation by the European Space Agency that in 2013 and 2014, after years when the volume of Arctic ice had been diminishing, it increased again by as much as 33 per cent. The other was that Canadian scientists studying the effect of climate change on Arctic ice from an icebreaker had to suspend their research, when their vessel was called to the aid of other ships trapped in the thickest summer ice seen in Hudson Bay for 20 years.

For more than a decade now, the belief that, thanks to global warming, Arctic ice was vanishing has been for the warmists the ultimate poster-child for their cause (along with those “vanishing” polar bears). In 2007, with the aid of scientists such as Wieslaw Maslowski and Peter Wadhams, the BBC and others were telling us that the Arctic would be totally “ice free by 2013” (the Independent even cleared its front page to announce that the ice could all have disappeared within weeks).

By 2011, the BBC’s science editor Richard Black was telling us that the ice would “probably be gone within this decade”. In 2012, his colleague Roger Harrabin was reporting that the sea ice was now melting so fast that more had vanished that summer than “at any time since satellite records began”.

So taken in had others been by all these dire predictions, that in 2008 the activist Gordon Lewis Pugh, after speaking at a conference alongside

Al Gore, set out to paddle a kayak to the North Pole – only to have to abort his trip after a few days because “the ice was too thick”. In 2009, the three-man Caitlin expedition, sponsored by a “climate risk” insurance company, and backed by the BBC and the Prince of Wales, set out to walk to the North Pole. Their intention was to measure the thickness of the vanishing ice with an electronic instrument, but it froze so hard that they had to resort to a tape measure. Again, after a few weeks, they had to be airlifted back to a rescue ship because the constantly shifting ice was “too thick”.

In December 2013, the world followed agog the plight of yet another “scientific expedition”, when 52 climate activists, accompanied by reporters from the BBC and the Guardian, sailed into the Antarctic to measure the effects of global warming on its sea-ice. By Christmas their ship was so dangerously trapped by thick, multi-year ice that they had to be helicoptered to a Chinese ship 10 miles away, which itself then got so trapped in ice that they had to be airlifted again to two other ships even further away.

What made all this particularly absurd was that, despite being led by an Australian scientist, they were so taken in by the make-believe that they seemed quite oblivious to the satellite records showing that Antarctic sea-ice had long been expanding to such record levels that these more than matched any decline in the Arctic ice at the other end of the world. But wasn’t the whole point of this warming that it was meant to be “global”?

Of course, the reason why they have all wanted the ice at the poles to melt, not least on the land in Antarctica and Greenland, is that this would bring about their ultimate scare scenario: those sea levels rising by as much as 20 feet, which, as Al Gore showed in his Oscar-winning film An Inconvenient Truth, would flood New York, Shanghai and many of the world’s most populous cities.

But, alas, it just isn’t happening. In recent years there has been more polar ice in the world than at any time since satellite records began in 1979. In the very year they had forecast that the Arctic would be “ice free”, its thickness increased by a third. Polar bear numbers are rising, not falling. Temperatures in Greenland have shown no increase for decades.

The greatest scare story of all simply isn’t turning out as their computer models predicted. And no one has been more dangerously taken in by this silly scare story than the warmists themselves.",very_low,"Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",81,"Christopher Booker’s article claims that sea ice behavior contradicts the predicted effects of climate change, but his argument contains major scientific inaccuracies. It uses anecdotal claims as evidence, short-term year-to-year changes to dismiss long-term trends, and builds on cherry-picked information to reach its conclusions. In reality, the long-term trend of sea ice loss is clear, and mass loss from ice sheets is contributing to sea level rise.

","The writer fails to understand interannual variability. Long-term ice extent decline and ice volume decline does not mean each year will be lower than the year before, but that the long-term trend is towards less sea ice and thinner ice. The fact that the ice thickness increased from the record low in 2012 is no surprise since there was more ice left over in summer 2013 and 2014. This does not signal a “recovery” as the ice is still much thinner than it was in the 1980s and 1990s. It is simply a reflection of interannual variability, in particular a cooler summer in 2013 that resulted in significantly less ice melt that year. Note that the thickness did not increase by a third, the total ice volume (thickness x area) increased.

The article contains numerous scientific errors as well as errors in understanding basic physics and how things are measured. For example, the author incorrectly states that you cannot measure thick ice with electromagnetic induction instruments and that instead a tape measure was needed. In fact the reverse is true, if the ice is too thick, it’s too hard to drill through the ice and measure it with a tape measure. The author is also incorrect that there is more polar ice than since 1979. Global sea ice measurements do not support this statement.

Finally the fact that ships get stuck in the ice is never a surprise to those working in the polar regions. Conditions vary regionally all the time and movement of ice can suddenly result in ice compression and thick ice that may trap ships.

","This “take” on Arctic sea-ice changes, and more generally polar ice evolution, is highly inaccurate and totally misleading. The authors goes to great lengths to try to convince readers that polar ice is doing just fine, and therefore by extension that global warming is nothing to worry about – he cherry-picks claims, tries to pass anecdotes as evidence and annual changes as representative of long-term trends.

","This article is cherry picking individual years in the satellite sea ice record whilst ignoring the long term trend. It uses anecdotes of ships getting stuck in locally thick sea ice whilst ignoring the broader spatial and temporal patterns of change. It uses misleading confusion of the effect of sea ice and land ice on sea level to justify the authors opinion that climate change is one of “the longest-running farces of our modern world”. Arctic sea ice is just one thread of evidence amongst many that suggest the climate is undergoing a warming shift as a result of anthropogenic activities.

","Emmanuel M Vincent, Research Scientist, University of California, Merced: Emmanuel Vincent, Research Scientist, Editor, Science Feedback
","The article contains major inacurracies and fails to remind the broader context of polar sea-ice and land-ice evolution over the last several decades. It also builds on a few cherry-picked facts to reach its conclusions; in science one has to account for all evidences to conclude on the most likely theory.

","Britta Voss, Postdoctoral Research fellow, U.S. Geological Survey
","This article cherry-picks portions of climate records which suit the author’s argument (that changes in Arctic ice are overstated or not a matter of concern) and relies on anecdotes rather than technical analysis.

","Kyle Armour, Assistant Professor, University of Washington
","This article contains major scientific errors in just about every paragraph. Those scientific statements that are somewhat accurate are used in very misleading ways (e.g., the expansion of Antarctic sea ice being incorrectly linked to sea level rise; and the increase in sea-ice volume over just a few years being taken as a sign of sea-ice recovery). Further, the article highlights statements made in the press and findings by scientists that have always been considered far outside the scientific mainstream, which gives me the impression that the article was written to be intentionally misleading.

Analysis of “Earth heading for ‘mini ice age’ within 15 years”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-telegraph-dan-hyde-earth-heading-for-mini-ice-age-within-15-years/,Earth heading for ‘mini ice age’ within 15 years,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11733369/Earth-heading-for-mini-ice-age-within-15-years.html,"The earth is 15 years from a period of low solar activity similar to that last seen during the ""mini ice-age"" of the 17th century, when the Thames froze.

Solar researchers at the University of Northumbria have created a new model of the sun's activity which they claim produces ""unprecedentedly accurate predictions"".

They said fluid movements within the sun, which are thought to create 11-year cycles in the weather, will converge in the 2030s.

Solar activity will fall by 60 per cent as two waves of fluid ""effectively cancel each other out"", Prof Valentina Zharkova said in a presentation to the National Astronomy Meeting in Llandudno.

• Fiddling with temperature data is biggest science scandal ever (31,000 comments)

“[In the cycle between 2030 and around 2040] the two waves exactly mirror each other – peaking at the same time but in opposite hemispheres of the sun,"" she said.

""Their interaction will be disruptive, or they will nearly cancel each other.

""We predict that this will lead to the properties of a ‘Maunder minimum'"".

Maunder minimum, indicating low sunspot activity, was the name given to the period between 1645 and 1715, when Europe and North America experienced very cold winters.

In England during this ""Little Ice Age"", River Thames frost fairs were held. In the winter of 1683-84 the Thames froze over for seven weeks, during which it was ""passable by foot"", according to historical records.

Prof Zharkova said scientists had known about one dynamo caused by convecting fluids deep within the sun, but her research appeared to have uncovered another.

""We found magnetic wave components appearing in pairs, originating in two different layers in the sun’s interior,"" she said.

• Climate change could undermine the last 50 years of health advances
• Loaves of bread 'smaller in future' due to climate change
• Polar bears 'have started eating dolphins due to climate change'

""They both have a frequency of approximately 11 years, although this frequency is slightly different, and they are offset in time.

""Over the cycle, the waves fluctuate between the northern and southern hemispheres of the Sun. Combining both waves together and comparing to real data for the current solar cycle, we found that our predictions showed an accuracy of 97 per cent.

""Effectively, when the waves are approximately in phase, they can show strong interaction, or resonance, and we have strong solar activity.

""When they are out of phase, we have solar minimums. When there is full phase separation, we have the conditions last seen during the Maunder minimum, 370 years ago.""","low, very_low","Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading",105,"The article’s central message about an imminent mini ice age is unfounded, as it’s based on an incorrect understanding of what the Maunder minimum is, and jumps to conclusions about future climate impacts.

","The article is based on material in a press release for an international astronomy meeting. Nowhere in the press release is it stated that this will cause a mini ice age, or cold winters, or the Thames to freeze. The press release is limited to a study of the solar cycle. The peer reviewed literature shows that changes in solar irradiance due to sunspot cycles may cause the global average temperature to vary by up to 0.1C on an eleven year cycle. The published peer reviewed literature concludes that the Little Ice Age was primarily due to an extended period of increased volcanic activity. A recent study [in press] quantified the cause of the cooling during the Little Ice Age (1600-1850) to be primarily due to changes in volcanic activity (77%) and secondarily due to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations (13%); changes in solar output contributed only about 10% to the net cooling of the Little Ice Age.

",,,,"Michael Lockwood, Professor of Space Environment Physics, University of Reading
","The whole argument in the article rests on the incorrect myth that the Maunder minimum caused a “mini ice age” and uses that name to draw specious implications and conclusions. Just a couple of weeks ago we made a press release about state-of-the-art climate modelling led by the Met Office (by Sarah Ineson et al., published in Nature Communications) that shows what a return to Maunder minimum conditions would (and would not do) – but that is ignored.

","Loic Jullion, Postdoctoral Research fellow, Mediterranean Institute of Oceanography
","The Author (Dan Hyde) uses a paper focussing purely on the dynamics of the Sun solar activity to extrapolate the arrival of an upcoming ice age. Unless Dan Hyde actually attended the meeting and heard the authors explicitly mentioning the impact of their findings on climate, this article is misleading.

","Emmanuel M Vincent, Research Scientist, University of California, Merced
","This article concludes on the imminence of an ice age while the initial scientists’ press release—although ambiguous—does not. Why not fact-check sensational information before publication?

","Britta Voss, Postdoctoral Research fellow, U.S. Geological Survey
","The research this article reports on does not support a “mini ice age”, and the article does not offer commentary from researchers not involved in the work or point out that the results have not yet gone through the process of peer review.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“The earth is 15 years from a “mini ice-age” that will cause bitterly cold winters during which rivers such as the Thames freeze over, scientists have predicted.” 
","The term “mini ice age” is inherently misleading in the context of solar variations as it implies a global decrease in temperatures and at all times of year. This does not apply at all to the solar Maunder minimum. Temperature observations from central England show that summers during the Maunder minimum were, if anything, slightly warmer than average – indeed the third warmest summer in that record occurred in the middle of the Maunder minimum, just 2 years after the coldest winter. Hence there was certainly not the unremitting cold in the Maunder minimum that the term “mini ice age” implies. There is evidence that there was increased occurrence of cold winters during the Maunder minimum but this is an effect of jet stream behaviour specific to northern Europe and the USA and not a global ice age. Recent climate modelling has reproduced this effect and indicates that the inferred lower solar ultraviolet emissions during the Maunder minimum modified the jet stream such that winters in northern Europe and the USA were colder but those in Greenland/Canada and southern Europe were warmer. This was not an “ice age” of any kind. Part of the confusion exploited by this article is that there is some evidence from tree ring data for a slight global decrease in temperatures that has been called “the little ice age” but this is nothing to do with solar variations and commenced decades before solar activity fell and the Maunder minimum began and continued after it ended.

","First of all, the scientists mentioned in the article have not predicted a “mini ice-age”, but an extended period of low solar activity similar to the 17th-century Maunder Minimum. The Maunder Minimum falls into a more extended period of somewhat cooler climate conditions termed the “Little Ice Age” (although this was no true “ice age”). It has thus become rather fashionable to claim that the “Little Ice Age” was caused by low solar activity, but this is not what the science says. First, the “Little Ice Age” began already way before the Maunder Minimum and ended much later. Second, low solar activity has contributed to the cooler conditions in the late 17th century, but other drivers like frequent and powerful volcanic eruptions are responsible for most of the cooling. The link from a prediction of low solar activity in the future to a “mini ice-age” is thus highly questionable.

",,,“Temperatures will fall dramatically in the 2030s.”,"While regional and seasonal effects might be larger, the expected global temperature response to a future grand solar minimum similar to the Maunder Minimum is a cooling of about 0.1°C. It should be pointed out that this cooling would occur on the background of current anthropogenic warming which is about a factor of 10 larger. To claim that “temperatures will fall dramatically” is thus not really justified. It is also clear from these numbers that a future grand solar minimum (which would last only for a few decades anyway) would not save us from global warming, as we have shown in a scientific paper and explained here. The marginal temperature differences between warming scenarios with and without a future Maunder Minimum is illustrated here:

",,,,"“In a presentation to the National Astronomy Meeting in Llandudno, she said the result would be similar to freezing conditions of the late 17th century.”

","Dr. Zharkova’s research predicts a lower solar activity for the next couple solar cycles (explaining patterns in recent solar activity in terms of internal variability within the solar dynamo, and extrapolating them in the future), leading to a so-called “solar minimum”, but says absolutely nothing about its impact on the climate system.

A link between this decreased solar activity and the climate system cannot be drawn from the research presented or from the peer-reviewed paper on which it is based:

Analysis* of Pope Francis’ Encyclical Laudato Si,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/pope-francis-encyclical-laudato-si/,"ENCYCLICAL LETTER
LAUDATO SI’
OF THE HOLY FATHER
FRANCIS
ON CARE FOR OUR COMMON HOME",http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html,"1. “LAUDATO SI’, mi’ Signore” – “Praise be to you, my Lord”. In the words of this beautiful canticle, Saint Francis of Assisi reminds us that our common home is like a sister with whom we share our life and a beautiful mother who opens her arms to embrace us. “Praise be to you, my Lord, through our Sister, Mother Earth, who sustains and governs us, and who produces various fruit with coloured flowers and herbs”.[1]

2. This sister now cries out to us because of the harm we have inflicted on her by our irresponsible use and abuse of the goods with which God has endowed her. We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to plunder her at will. The violence present in our hearts, wounded by sin, is also reflected in the symptoms of sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life. This is why the earth herself, burdened and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor; she “groans in travail” (Rom 8:22). We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the earth (cf. Gen 2:7); our very bodies are made up of her elements, we breathe her air and we receive life and refreshment from her waters.

Nothing in this world is indifferent to us

3. More than fifty years ago, with the world teetering on the brink of nuclear crisis, Pope Saint John XXIII wrote an Encyclical which not only rejected war but offered a proposal for peace. He addressed his message Pacem in Terris to the entire “Catholic world” and indeed “to all men and women of good will”. Now, faced as we are with global environmental deterioration, I wish to address every person living on this planet. In my Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium, I wrote to all the members of the Church with the aim of encouraging ongoing missionary renewal. In this Encyclical, I would like to enter into dialogue with all people about our common home.

4. In 1971, eight years after Pacem in Terris, Blessed Pope Paul VI referred to the ecological concern as “a tragic consequence” of unchecked human activity: “Due to an ill-considered exploitation of nature, humanity runs the risk of destroying it and becoming in turn a victim of this degradation”.[2] He spoke in similar terms to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations about the potential for an “ecological catastrophe under the effective explosion of industrial civilization”, and stressed “the urgent need for a radical change in the conduct of humanity”, inasmuch as “the most extraordinary scientific advances, the most amazing technical abilities, the most astonishing economic growth, unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress, will definitively turn against man”.[3]

5. Saint John Paul II became increasingly concerned about this issue. In his first Encyclical he warned that human beings frequently seem “to see no other meaning in their natural environment than what serves for immediate use and consumption”.[4] Subsequently, he would call for a global ecological conversion.[5] At the same time, he noted that little effort had been made to “safeguard the moral conditions for an authentic human ecology”.[6] The destruction of the human environment is extremely serious, not only because God has entrusted the world to us men and women, but because human life is itself a gift which must be defended from various forms of debasement. Every effort to protect and improve our world entails profound changes in “lifestyles, models of production and consumption, and the established structures of power which today govern societies”.[7] Authentic human development has a moral character. It presumes full respect for the human person, but it must also be concerned for the world around us and “take into account the nature of each being and of its mutual connection in an ordered system”.[8] Accordingly, our human ability to transform reality must proceed in line with God’s original gift of all that is.[9]

6. My predecessor Benedict XVI likewise proposed “eliminating the structural causes of the dysfunctions of the world economy and correcting models of growth which have proved incapable of ensuring respect for the environment”.[10] He observed that the world cannot be analyzed by isolating only one of its aspects, since “the book of nature is one and indivisible”, and includes the environment, life, sexuality, the family, social relations, and so forth. It follows that “the deterioration of nature is closely connected to the culture which shapes human coexistence”.[11] Pope Benedict asked us to recognize that the natural environment has been gravely damaged by our irresponsible behaviour. The social environment has also suffered damage. Both are ultimately due to the same evil: the notion that there are no indisputable truths to guide our lives, and hence human freedom is limitless. We have forgotten that “man is not only a freedom which he creates for himself. Man does not create himself. He is spirit and will, but also nature”.[12] With paternal concern, Benedict urged us to realize that creation is harmed “where we ourselves have the final word, where everything is simply our property and we use it for ourselves alone. The misuse of creation begins when we no longer recognize any higher instance than ourselves, when we see nothing else but ourselves”.[13]

United by the same concern

7. These statements of the Popes echo the reflections of numerous scientists, philosophers, theologians and civic groups, all of which have enriched the Church’s thinking on these questions. Outside the Catholic Church, other Churches and Christian communities – and other religions as well – have expressed deep concern and offered valuable reflections on issues which all of us find disturbing. To give just one striking example, I would mention the statements made by the beloved Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, with whom we share the hope of full ecclesial communion.

8. Patriarch Bartholomew has spoken in particular of the need for each of us to repent of the ways we have harmed the planet, for “inasmuch as we all generate small ecological damage”, we are called to acknowledge “our contribution, smaller or greater, to the disfigurement and destruction of creation”.[14] He has repeatedly stated this firmly and persuasively, challenging us to acknowledge our sins against creation: “For human beings… to destroy the biological diversity of God’s creation; for human beings to degrade the integrity of the earth by causing changes in its climate, by stripping the earth of its natural forests or destroying its wetlands; for human beings to contaminate the earth’s waters, its land, its air, and its life – these are sins”.[15] For “to commit a crime against the natural world is a sin against ourselves and a sin against God”.[16]

9. At the same time, Bartholomew has drawn attention to the ethical and spiritual roots of environmental problems, which require that we look for solutions not only in technology but in a change of humanity; otherwise we would be dealing merely with symptoms. He asks us to replace consumption with sacrifice, greed with generosity, wastefulness with a spirit of sharing, an asceticism which “entails learning to give, and not simply to give up. It is a way of loving, of moving gradually away from what I want to what God’s world needs. It is liberation from fear, greed and compulsion”.[17] As Christians, we are also called “to accept the world as a sacrament of communion, as a way of sharing with God and our neighbours on a global scale. It is our humble conviction that the divine and the human meet in the slightest detail in the seamless garment of God’s creation, in the last speck of dust of our planet”.[18]

Saint Francis of Assisi

10. I do not want to write this Encyclical without turning to that attractive and compelling figure, whose name I took as my guide and inspiration when I was elected Bishop of Rome. I believe that Saint Francis is the example par excellence of care for the vulnerable and of an integral ecology lived out joyfully and authentically. He is the patron saint of all who study and work in the area of ecology, and he is also much loved by non-Christians. He was particularly concerned for God’s creation and for the poor and outcast. He loved, and was deeply loved for his joy, his generous self-giving, his openheartedness. He was a mystic and a pilgrim who lived in simplicity and in wonderful harmony with God, with others, with nature and with himself. He shows us just how inseparable the bond is between concern for nature, justice for the poor, commitment to society, and interior peace.

11. Francis helps us to see that an integral ecology calls for openness to categories which transcend the language of mathematics and biology, and take us to the heart of what it is to be human. Just as happens when we fall in love with someone, whenever he would gaze at the sun, the moon or the smallest of animals, he burst into song, drawing all other creatures into his praise. He communed with all creation, even preaching to the flowers, inviting them “to praise the Lord, just as if they were endowed with reason”.[19] His response to the world around him was so much more than intellectual appreciation or economic calculus, for to him each and every creature was a sister united to him by bonds of affection. That is why he felt called to care for all that exists. His disciple Saint Bonaventure tells us that, “from a reflection on the primary source of all things, filled with even more abundant piety, he would call creatures, no matter how small, by the name of ‘brother’ or ‘sister’”.[20] Such a conviction cannot be written off as naive romanticism, for it affects the choices which determine our behaviour. If we approach nature and the environment without this openness to awe and wonder, if we no longer speak the language of fraternity and beauty in our relationship with the world, our attitude will be that of masters, consumers, ruthless exploiters, unable to set limits on their immediate needs. By contrast, if we feel intimately united with all that exists, then sobriety and care will well up spontaneously. The poverty and austerity of Saint Francis were no mere veneer of asceticism, but something much more radical: a refusal to turn reality into an object simply to be used and controlled.

12. What is more, Saint Francis, faithful to Scripture, invites us to see nature as a magnificent book in which God speaks to us and grants us a glimpse of his infinite beauty and goodness. “Through the greatness and the beauty of creatures one comes to know by analogy their maker” (Wis 13:5); indeed, “his eternal power and divinity have been made known through his works since the creation of the world” (Rom 1:20). For this reason, Francis asked that part of the friary garden always be left untouched, so that wild flowers and herbs could grow there, and those who saw them could raise their minds to God, the Creator of such beauty.[21] Rather than a problem to be solved, the world is a joyful mystery to be contemplated with gladness and praise.

My appeal

13. The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change. The Creator does not abandon us; he never forsakes his loving plan or repents of having created us. Humanity still has the ability to work together in building our common home. Here I want to recognize, encourage and thank all those striving in countless ways to guarantee the protection of the home which we share. Particular appreciation is owed to those who tirelessly seek to resolve the tragic effects of environmental degradation on the lives of the world’s poorest. Young people demand change. They wonder how anyone can claim to be building a better future without thinking of the environmental crisis and the sufferings of the excluded.

14. I urgently appeal, then, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all. The worldwide ecological movement has already made considerable progress and led to the establishment of numerous organizations committed to raising awareness of these challenges. Regrettably, many efforts to seek concrete solutions to the environmental crisis have proved ineffective, not only because of powerful opposition but also because of a more general lack of interest. Obstructionist attitudes, even on the part of believers, can range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation or blind confidence in technical solutions. We require a new and universal solidarity. As the bishops of Southern Africa have stated: “Everyone’s talents and involvement are needed to redress the damage caused by human abuse of God’s creation”. [22] All of us can cooperate as instruments of God for the care of creation, each according to his or her own culture, experience, involvements and talents.

15. It is my hope that this Encyclical Letter, which is now added to the body of the Church’s social teaching, can help us to acknowledge the appeal, immensity and urgency of the challenge we face. I will begin by briefly reviewing several aspects of the present ecological crisis, with the aim of drawing on the results of the best scientific research available today, letting them touch us deeply and provide a concrete foundation for the ethical and spiritual itinerary that follows. I will then consider some principles drawn from the Judaeo-Christian tradition which can render our commitment to the environment more coherent. I will then attempt to get to the roots of the present situation, so as to consider not only its symptoms but also its deepest causes. This will help to provide an approach to ecology which respects our unique place as human beings in this world and our relationship to our surroundings. In light of this reflection, I will advance some broader proposals for dialogue and action which would involve each of us as individuals, and also affect international policy. Finally, convinced as I am that change is impossible without motivation and a process of education, I will offer some inspired guidelines for human development to be found in the treasure of Christian spiritual experience.

16. Although each chapter will have its own subject and specific approach, it will also take up and re-examine important questions previously dealt with. This is particularly the case with a number of themes which will reappear as the Encyclical unfolds. As examples, I will point to the intimate relationship between the poor and the fragility of the planet, the conviction that everything in the world is connected, the critique of new paradigms and forms of power derived from technology, the call to seek other ways of understanding the economy and progress, the value proper to each creature, the human meaning of ecology, the need for forthright and honest debate, the serious responsibility of international and local policy, the throwaway culture and the proposal of a new lifestyle. These questions will not be dealt with once and for all, but reframed and enriched again and again.

CHAPTER ONE

WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR COMMON HOME

17. Theological and philosophical reflections on the situation of humanity and the world can sound tiresome and abstract, unless they are grounded in a fresh analysis of our present situation, which is in many ways unprecedented in the history of humanity. So, before considering how faith brings new incentives and requirements with regard to the world of which we are a part, I will briefly turn to what is happening to our common home.

18. The continued acceleration of changes affecting humanity and the planet is coupled today with a more intensified pace of life and work which might be called “rapidification”. Although change is part of the working of complex systems, the speed with which human activity has developed contrasts with the naturally slow pace of biological evolution. Moreover, the goals of this rapid and constant change are not necessarily geared to the common good or to integral and sustainable human development. Change is something desirable, yet it becomes a source of anxiety when it causes harm to the world and to the quality of life of much of humanity.

19. Following a period of irrational confidence in progress and human abilities, some sectors of society are now adopting a more critical approach. We see increasing sensitivity to the environment and the need to protect nature, along with a growing concern, both genuine and distressing, for what is happening to our planet. Let us review, however cursorily, those questions which are troubling us today and which we can no longer sweep under the carpet. Our goal is not to amass information or to satisfy curiosity, but rather to become painfully aware, to dare to turn what is happening to the world into our own personal suffering and thus to discover what each of us can do about it.

I. POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE

Pollution, waste and the throwaway culture

20. Some forms of pollution are part of people’s daily experience. Exposure to atmospheric pollutants produces a broad spectrum of health hazards, especially for the poor, and causes millions of premature deaths. People take sick, for example, from breathing high levels of smoke from fuels used in cooking or heating. There is also pollution that affects everyone, caused by transport, industrial fumes, substances which contribute to the acidification of soil and water, fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and agrotoxins in general. Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others.

21. Account must also be taken of the pollution produced by residue, including dangerous waste present in different areas. Each year hundreds of millions of tons of waste are generated, much of it non-biodegradable, highly toxic and radioactive, from homes and businesses, from construction and demolition sites, from clinical, electronic and industrial sources. The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth. In many parts of the planet, the elderly lament that once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish. Industrial waste and chemical products utilized in cities and agricultural areas can lead to bioaccumulation in the organisms of the local population, even when levels of toxins in those places are low. Frequently no measures are taken until after people’s health has been irreversibly affected.

22. These problems are closely linked to a throwaway culture which affects the excluded just as it quickly reduces things to rubbish. To cite one example, most of the paper we produce is thrown away and not recycled. It is hard for us to accept that the way natural ecosystems work is exemplary: plants synthesize nutrients which feed herbivores; these in turn become food for carnivores, which produce significant quantities of organic waste which give rise to new generations of plants. But our industrial system, at the end of its cycle of production and consumption, has not developed the capacity to absorb and reuse waste and by-products. We have not yet managed to adopt a circular model of production capable of preserving resources for present and future generations, while limiting as much as possible the use of non-renewable resources, moderating their consumption, maximizing their efficient use, reusing and recycling them. A serious consideration of this issue would be one way of counteracting the throwaway culture which affects the entire planet, but it must be said that only limited progress has been made in this regard.

Climate as a common good

23. The climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all. At the global level, it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions for human life. A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system. In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon. Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it. It is true that there are other factors (such as volcanic activity, variations in the earth’s orbit and axis, the solar cycle), yet a number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity. As these gases build up in the atmosphere, they hamper the escape of heat produced by sunlight at the earth’s surface. The problem is aggravated by a model of development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels, which is at the heart of the worldwide energy system. Another determining factor has been an increase in changed uses of the soil, principally deforestation for agricultural purposes.

24. Warming has effects on the carbon cycle. It creates a vicious circle which aggravates the situation even more, affecting the availability of essential resources like drinking water, energy and agricultural production in warmer regions, and leading to the extinction of part of the planet’s biodiversity. The melting in the polar ice caps and in high altitude plains can lead to the dangerous release of methane gas, while the decomposition of frozen organic material can further increase the emission of carbon dioxide. Things are made worse by the loss of tropical forests which would otherwise help to mitigate climate change. Carbon dioxide pollution increases the acidification of the oceans and compromises the marine food chain. If present trends continue, this century may well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us. A rise in the sea level, for example, can create extremely serious situations, if we consider that a quarter of the world’s population lives on the coast or nearby, and that the majority of our megacities are situated in coastal areas.

25. Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. Its worst impact will probably be felt by developing countries in coming decades. Many of the poor live in areas particularly affected by phenomena related to warming, and their means of subsistence are largely dependent on natural reserves and ecosystemic services such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. They have no other financial activities or resources which can enable them to adapt to climate change or to face natural disasters, and their access to social services and protection is very limited. For example, changes in climate, to which animals and plants cannot adapt, lead them to migrate; this in turn affects the livelihood of the poor, who are then forced to leave their homes, with great uncertainty for their future and that of their children. There has been a tragic rise in the number of migrants seeking to flee from the growing poverty caused by environmental degradation. They are not recognized by international conventions as refugees; they bear the loss of the lives they have left behind, without enjoying any legal protection whatsoever. Sadly, there is widespread indifference to such suffering, which is even now taking place throughout our world. Our lack of response to these tragedies involving our brothers and sisters points to the loss of that sense of responsibility for our fellow men and women upon which all civil society is founded.

26. Many of those who possess more resources and economic or political power seem mostly to be concerned with masking the problems or concealing their symptoms, simply making efforts to reduce some of the negative impacts of climate change. However, many of these symptoms indicate that such effects will continue to worsen if we continue with current models of production and consumption. There is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced, for example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy. Worldwide there is minimal access to clean and renewable energy. There is still a need to develop adequate storage technologies. Some countries have made considerable progress, although it is far from constituting a significant proportion. Investments have also been made in means of production and transportation which consume less energy and require fewer raw materials, as well as in methods of construction and renovating buildings which improve their energy efficiency. But these good practices are still far from widespread.

II. THE ISSUE OF WATER

27. Other indicators of the present situation have to do with the depletion of natural resources. We all know that it is not possible to sustain the present level of consumption in developed countries and wealthier sectors of society, where the habit of wasting and discarding has reached unprecedented levels. The exploitation of the planet has already exceeded acceptable limits and we still have not solved the problem of poverty.

28. Fresh drinking water is an issue of primary importance, since it is indispensable for human life and for supporting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Sources of fresh water are necessary for health care, agriculture and industry. Water supplies used to be relatively constant, but now in many places demand exceeds the sustainable supply, with dramatic consequences in the short and long term. Large cities dependent on significant supplies of water have experienced periods of shortage, and at critical moments these have not always been administered with sufficient oversight and impartiality. Water poverty especially affects Africa where large sectors of the population have no access to safe drinking water or experience droughts which impede agricultural production. Some countries have areas rich in water while others endure drastic scarcity.

29. One particularly serious problem is the quality of water available to the poor. Every day, unsafe water results in many deaths and the spread of water-related diseases, including those caused by microorganisms and chemical substances. Dysentery and cholera, linked to inadequate hygiene and water supplies, are a significant cause of suffering and of infant mortality. Underground water sources in many places are threatened by the pollution produced in certain mining, farming and industrial activities, especially in countries lacking adequate regulation or controls. It is not only a question of industrial waste. Detergents and chemical products, commonly used in many places of the world, continue to pour into our rivers, lakes and seas.

30. Even as the quality of available water is constantly diminishing, in some places there is a growing tendency, despite its scarcity, to privatize this resource, turning it into a commodity subject to the laws of the market. Yet access to safe drinkable water is a basic and universal human right, since it is essential to human survival and, as such, is a condition for the exercise of other human rights. Our world has a grave social debt towards the poor who lack access to drinking water, because they are denied the right to a life consistent with their inalienable dignity. This debt can be paid partly by an increase in funding to provide clean water and sanitary services among the poor. But water continues to be wasted, not only in the developed world but also in developing countries which possess it in abundance. This shows that the problem of water is partly an educational and cultural issue, since there is little awareness of the seriousness of such behaviour within a context of great inequality.

31. Greater scarcity of water will lead to an increase in the cost of food and the various products which depend on its use. Some studies warn that an acute water shortage may occur within a few decades unless urgent action is taken. The environmental repercussions could affect billions of people; it is also conceivable that the control of water by large multinational businesses may become a major source of conflict in this century.[23]

III. LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY

32. The earth’s resources are also being plundered because of short-sighted approaches to the economy, commerce and production. The loss of forests and woodlands entails the loss of species which may constitute extremely important resources in the future, not only for food but also for curing disease and other uses. Different species contain genes which could be key resources in years ahead for meeting human needs and regulating environmental problems.

33. It is not enough, however, to think of different species merely as potential “resources” to be exploited, while overlooking the fact that they have value in themselves. Each year sees the disappearance of thousands of plant and animal species which we will never know, which our children will never see, because they have been lost for ever. The great majority become extinct for reasons related to human activity. Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence, nor convey their message to us. We have no such right.

34. It may well disturb us to learn of the extinction of mammals or birds, since they are more visible. But the good functioning of ecosystems also requires fungi, algae, worms, insects, reptiles and an innumerable variety of microorganisms. Some less numerous species, although generally unseen, nonetheless play a critical role in maintaining the equilibrium of a particular place. Human beings must intervene when a geosystem reaches a critical state. But nowadays, such intervention in nature has become more and more frequent. As a consequence, serious problems arise, leading to further interventions; human activity becomes ubiquitous, with all the risks which this entails. Often a vicious circle results, as human intervention to resolve a problem further aggravates the situation. For example, many birds and insects which disappear due to synthetic agrotoxins are helpful for agriculture: their disappearance will have to be compensated for by yet other techniques which may well prove harmful. We must be grateful for the praiseworthy efforts being made by scientists and engineers dedicated to finding solutions to man-made problems. But a sober look at our world shows that the degree of human intervention, often in the service of business interests and consumerism, is actually making our earth less rich and beautiful, ever more limited and grey, even as technological advances and consumer goods continue to abound limitlessly. We seem to think that we can substitute an irreplaceable and irretrievable beauty with something which we have created ourselves.

35. In assessing the environmental impact of any project, concern is usually shown for its effects on soil, water and air, yet few careful studies are made of its impact on biodiversity, as if the loss of species or animals and plant groups were of little importance. Highways, new plantations, the fencing-off of certain areas, the damming of water sources, and similar developments, crowd out natural habitats and, at times, break them up in such a way that animal populations can no longer migrate or roam freely. As a result, some species face extinction. Alternatives exist which at least lessen the impact of these projects, like the creation of biological corridors, but few countries demonstrate such concern and foresight. Frequently, when certain species are exploited commercially, little attention is paid to studying their reproductive patterns in order to prevent their depletion and the consequent imbalance of the ecosystem.

36. Caring for ecosystems demands far-sightedness, since no one looking for quick and easy profit is truly interested in their preservation. But the cost of the damage caused by such selfish lack of concern is much greater than the economic benefits to be obtained. Where certain species are destroyed or seriously harmed, the values involved are incalculable. We can be silent witnesses to terrible injustices if we think that we can obtain significant benefits by making the rest of humanity, present and future, pay the extremely high costs of environmental deterioration.

37. Some countries have made significant progress in establishing sanctuaries on land and in the oceans where any human intervention is prohibited which might modify their features or alter their original structures. In the protection of biodiversity, specialists insist on the need for particular attention to be shown to areas richer both in the number of species and in endemic, rare or less protected species. Certain places need greater protection because of their immense importance for the global ecosystem, or because they represent important water reserves and thus safeguard other forms of life.

38. Let us mention, for example, those richly biodiverse lungs of our planet which are the Amazon and the Congo basins, or the great aquifers and glaciers. We know how important these are for the entire earth and for the future of humanity. The ecosystems of tropical forests possess an enormously complex biodiversity which is almost impossible to appreciate fully, yet when these forests are burned down or levelled for purposes of cultivation, within the space of a few years countless species are lost and the areas frequently become arid wastelands. A delicate balance has to be maintained when speaking about these places, for we cannot overlook the huge global economic interests which, under the guise of protecting them, can undermine the sovereignty of individual nations. In fact, there are “proposals to internationalize the Amazon, which only serve the economic interests of transnational corporations”.[24] We cannot fail to praise the commitment of international agencies and civil society organizations which draw public attention to these issues and offer critical cooperation, employing legitimate means of pressure, to ensure that each government carries out its proper and inalienable responsibility to preserve its country’s environment and natural resources, without capitulating to spurious local or international interests.

39. The replacement of virgin forest with plantations of trees, usually monocultures, is rarely adequately analyzed. Yet this can seriously compromise a biodiversity which the new species being introduced does not accommodate. Similarly, wetlands converted into cultivated land lose the enormous biodiversity which they formerly hosted. In some coastal areas the disappearance of ecosystems sustained by mangrove swamps is a source of serious concern.

40. Oceans not only contain the bulk of our planet’s water supply, but also most of the immense variety of living creatures, many of them still unknown to us and threatened for various reasons. What is more, marine life in rivers, lakes, seas and oceans, which feeds a great part of the world’s population, is affected by uncontrolled fishing, leading to a drastic depletion of certain species. Selective forms of fishing which discard much of what they collect continue unabated. Particularly threatened are marine organisms which we tend to overlook, like some forms of plankton; they represent a significant element in the ocean food chain, and species used for our food ultimately depend on them.

41. In tropical and subtropical seas, we find coral reefs comparable to the great forests on dry land, for they shelter approximately a million species, including fish, crabs, molluscs, sponges and algae. Many of the world’s coral reefs are already barren or in a state of constant decline. “Who turned the wonderworld of the seas into underwater cemeteries bereft of colour and life?”[25] This phenomenon is due largely to pollution which reaches the sea as the result of deforestation, agricultural monocultures, industrial waste and destructive fishing methods, especially those using cyanide and dynamite. It is aggravated by the rise in temperature of the oceans. All of this helps us to see that every intervention in nature can have consequences which are not immediately evident, and that certain ways of exploiting resources prove costly in terms of degradation which ultimately reaches the ocean bed itself.

42. Greater investment needs to be made in research aimed at understanding more fully the functioning of ecosystems and adequately analyzing the different variables associated with any significant modification of the environment. Because all creatures are connected, each must be cherished with love and respect, for all of us as living creatures are dependent on one another. Each area is responsible for the care of this family. This will require undertaking a careful inventory of the species which it hosts, with a view to developing programmes and strategies of protection with particular care for safeguarding species heading towards extinction.

IV. DECLINE IN THE QUALITY OF HUMAN LIFE AND THE BREAKDOWN OF SOCIETY

43. Human beings too are creatures of this world, enjoying a right to life and happiness, and endowed with unique dignity. So we cannot fail to consider the effects on people’s lives of environmental deterioration, current models of development and the throwaway culture.

44. Nowadays, for example, we are conscious of the disproportionate and unruly growth of many cities, which have become unhealthy to live in, not only because of pollution caused by toxic emissions but also as a result of urban chaos, poor transportation, and visual pollution and noise. Many cities are huge, inefficient structures, excessively wasteful of energy and water. Neighbourhoods, even those recently built, are congested, chaotic and lacking in sufficient green space. We were not meant to be inundated by cement, asphalt, glass and metal, and deprived of physical contact with nature.

45. In some places, rural and urban alike, the privatization of certain spaces has restricted people’s access to places of particular beauty. In others, “ecological” neighbourhoods have been created which are closed to outsiders in order to ensure an artificial tranquillity. Frequently, we find beautiful and carefully manicured green spaces in so-called “safer” areas of cities, but not in the more hidden areas where the disposable of society live.

46. The social dimensions of global change include the effects of technological innovations on employment, social exclusion, an inequitable distribution and consumption of energy and other services, social breakdown, increased violence and a rise in new forms of social aggression, drug trafficking, growing drug use by young people, and the loss of identity. These are signs that the growth of the past two centuries has not always led to an integral development and an improvement in the quality of life. Some of these signs are also symptomatic of real social decline, the silent rupture of the bonds of integration and social cohesion.

47. Furthermore, when media and the digital world become omnipresent, their influence can stop people from learning how to live wisely, to think deeply and to love generously. In this context, the great sages of the past run the risk of going unheard amid the noise and distractions of an information overload. Efforts need to be made to help these media become sources of new cultural progress for humanity and not a threat to our deepest riches. True wisdom, as the fruit of self-examination, dialogue and generous encounter between persons, is not acquired by a mere accumulation of data which eventually leads to overload and confusion, a sort of mental pollution. Real relationships with others, with all the challenges they entail, now tend to be replaced by a type of internet communication which enables us to choose or eliminate relationships at whim, thus giving rise to a new type of contrived emotion which has more to do with devices and displays than with other people and with nature. Today’s media do enable us to communicate and to share our knowledge and affections. Yet at times they also shield us from direct contact with the pain, the fears and the joys of others and the complexity of their personal experiences. For this reason, we should be concerned that, alongside the exciting possibilities offered by these media, a deep and melancholic dissatisfaction with interpersonal relations, or a harmful sense of isolation, can also arise.

V. GLOBAL INEQUALITY

48. The human environment and the natural environment deteriorate together; we cannot adequately combat environmental degradation unless we attend to causes related to human and social degradation. In fact, the deterioration of the environment and of society affects the most vulnerable people on the planet: “Both everyday experience and scientific research show that the gravest effects of all attacks on the environment are suffered by the poorest”.[26] For example, the depletion of fishing reserves especially hurts small fishing communities without the means to replace those resources; water pollution particularly affects the poor who cannot buy bottled water; and rises in the sea level mainly affect impoverished coastal populations who have nowhere else to go. The impact of present imbalances is also seen in the premature death of many of the poor, in conflicts sparked by the shortage of resources, and in any number of other problems which are insufficiently represented on global agendas.[27]

49. It needs to be said that, generally speaking, there is little in the way of clear awareness of problems which especially affect the excluded. Yet they are the majority of the planet’s population, billions of people. These days, they are mentioned in international political and economic discussions, but one often has the impression that their problems are brought up as an afterthought, a question which gets added almost out of duty or in a tangential way, if not treated merely as collateral damage. Indeed, when all is said and done, they frequently remain at the bottom of the pile. This is due partly to the fact that many professionals, opinion makers, communications media and centres of power, being located in affluent urban areas, are far removed from the poor, with little direct contact with their problems. They live and reason from the comfortable position of a high level of development and a quality of life well beyond the reach of the majority of the world’s population. This lack of physical contact and encounter, encouraged at times by the disintegration of our cities, can lead to a numbing of conscience and to tendentious analyses which neglect parts of reality. At times this attitude exists side by side with a “green” rhetoric. Today, however, we have to realize that a true ecological approach always becomes a social approach; it must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor.

50. Instead of resolving the problems of the poor and thinking of how the world can be different, some can only propose a reduction in the birth rate. At times, developing countries face forms of international pressure which make economic assistance contingent on certain policies of “reproductive health”. Yet “while it is true that an unequal distribution of the population and of available resources creates obstacles to development and a sustainable use of the environment, it must nonetheless be recognized that demographic growth is fully compatible with an integral and shared development”.[28] To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. It is an attempt to legitimize the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalized, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption. Besides, we know that approximately a third of all food produced is discarded, and “whenever food is thrown out it is as if it were stolen from the table of the poor”.[29] Still, attention needs to be paid to imbalances in population density, on both national and global levels, since a rise in consumption would lead to complex regional situations, as a result of the interplay between problems linked to environmental pollution, transport, waste treatment, loss of resources and quality of life.

51. Inequity affects not only individuals but entire countries; it compels us to consider an ethics of international relations. A true “ecological debt” exists, particularly between the global north and south, connected to commercial imbalances with effects on the environment, and the disproportionate use of natural resources by certain countries over long periods of time. The export of raw materials to satisfy markets in the industrialized north has caused harm locally, as for example in mercury pollution in gold mining or sulphur dioxide pollution in copper mining. There is a pressing need to calculate the use of environmental space throughout the world for depositing gas residues which have been accumulating for two centuries and have created a situation which currently affects all the countries of the world. The warming caused by huge consumption on the part of some rich countries has repercussions on the poorest areas of the world, especially Africa, where a rise in temperature, together with drought, has proved devastating for farming. There is also the damage caused by the export of solid waste and toxic liquids to developing countries, and by the pollution produced by companies which operate in less developed countries in ways they could never do at home, in the countries in which they raise their capital: “We note that often the businesses which operate this way are multinationals. They do here what they would never do in developed countries or the so-called first world. Generally, after ceasing their activity and withdrawing, they leave behind great human and environmental liabilities such as unemployment, abandoned towns, the depletion of natural reserves, deforestation, the impoverishment of agriculture and local stock breeding, open pits, riven hills, polluted rivers and a handful of social works which are no longer sustainable”.[30]

52. The foreign debt of poor countries has become a way of controlling them, yet this is not the case where ecological debt is concerned. In different ways, developing countries, where the most important reserves of the biosphere are found, continue to fuel the development of richer countries at the cost of their own present and future. The land of the southern poor is rich and mostly unpolluted, yet access to ownership of goods and resources for meeting vital needs is inhibited by a system of commercial relations and ownership which is structurally perverse. The developed countries ought to help pay this debt by significantly limiting their consumption of non-renewable energy and by assisting poorer countries to support policies and programmes of sustainable development. The poorest areas and countries are less capable of adopting new models for reducing environmental impact because they lack the wherewithal to develop the necessary processes and to cover their costs. We must continue to be aware that, regarding climate change, there are differentiated responsibilities. As the United States bishops have said, greater attention must be given to “the needs of the poor, the weak and the vulnerable, in a debate often dominated by more powerful interests”.[31] We need to strengthen the conviction that we are one single human family. There are no frontiers or barriers, political or social, behind which we can hide, still less is there room for the globalization of indifference.",high,Sound reasoning,236,"Pope Francis’s encyclical rather accurately depicts the current reality of climate change. While it does contain a few minor scientific inaccuracies, and could be interpreted as understating the degree of certainty scientists have in understanding climate change impacts, the encyclical fairly represents the present concerns raised by the scientific community.

","The Pope’s encyclical is strongly aligned with the scientific consensus about the reality and risks posed by global warming. The most striking feature of the encyclical is its linking of environmental degradation to cultural and political decline, painting it as a moral issue, not just a practical problem.

","In the few passages dealing with climate science, this text does not contain major scientific inaccuracies – but it does contain some minor ones, or at least some poor choices of words. The presentation of some elements (e.g., the scientific consensus on the attribution of observed climate change) is not as clear as it could be.

I found Chapter 1 to be a great representation of ‘popular’ scientific understanding of the effects of climate change. However, there could have been more input on the interactions of how humans in one country influence humans in others (i.e. Fossil fuel production in North America / China decreasing rainfall in west Africa/India).

","The Encyclical summarized the current state of climate science well, in conjunction with a raft of other issues related to human exploitation of the natural environment.
The key part of this document is bridging the gap between the scientific observations that we make, which often do not engage the public’s attention, and the moral implications of humans as guardians of our planet (whether you are religious or not, this still makes sense).
As a specific point, I think the Encyclical could have been more definitive in attributing recent climate change to anthropogenic factors – mentioning the natural forcings in the context of warming seemed to be uncharacteristically overcautious.

","This encyclical is beautifully written and largely captures the scientific consensus. It is a bit too conservative in places, especially in terms of the amount of climate change attributed to humans.
",,,,,,,,,"“In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon.”
","It depends on the type of event. heatwaves and extreme heat events have increased since at least the 1950s1.

Though tropical cyclones and drought are a bit harder to analyse since natural climate variability also plays a large role. This means there may be a signal of change due to human activity, but is more difficult to measure, due to the noise of the natural variability of the climate.

Also, “attribution” can be done for specific events. this basically compares how often an extreme event of a particular magnitude and duration occurs in climate model simulations both with and without human emissions of greenhouse gases. This was first done on the 2003 European heatwave2. So it can be done, but is heavily dependent to the event you analyse, the spacial scale on which it occurs, and even the climate model/s and experimental set up you use3

",,,,"“….to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it. It is true that there are other factors (such as volcanic activity, variations in the earth’s orbit and axis, the solar cycle), yet a number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity.”","I think this statement is unnecessarily unclear and could be cherry-picked: “The Pope says volcanic activity, Earth’s orbit and the solar cycle cause global warming”.

While volcanic activity, changes in Earth’s orbit and the solar cycle can (and do) produce changes in climate, the recent trend of these forcings over the last couple of decades is probably towards net cooling.

","I find this statement a little weak. As mentioned above, natural factors would not lead to global warming over recent decades. Saying “a number of scientific studies” is a little bit of an understatement: it’s really almost all of the literature on the topic… The IPCC statement in the Summary for Policy Makers:

“It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period. {10.3}”

",,,"“Another determining factor has been an increase in changed uses of the soil, principally deforestation for agricultural purposes.”","This statement is correct. Deforestation leads to the emissions of greenhouse gases, a reduced absorption of gases and a range of other problems that adds to the problem of burning fossil fuels.

","Deforestation is principally the result of the agricultural expansion, for example soy bean and beef production in Brazil (1).

The conversion of forests to other types of land use leads to a release of greenhouse gases. Tropical deforestation alone emits around 0.57-1.22 Pg C y-1 (2) globally, or 7-14% of the total anthropogenic emissions. The large uncertainty is due to the complex interactions of multiple mechanisms that occur at different time scales such as instantaneous burning, and slower decay of slash residues (3). However, removing trees limits the capacity of the land surface to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide and thereby reduces the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to act as long-term carbon stores.

","This is really poorly phrased. If by “warmth of the sun’s rays reflected by the earth” one means something like “infrared radiation emitted by the earth when heated by the sun”, then okay – but that’s a stretch. As it is it makes it sound as if greenhouse gases trap reflected solar radiation…

","This statement is simply careless – sun’s rays reflected pass back out – its the suns rays absorbed and then re-emitted that get trapped. Its a basic error that should not exist.

","This is a bit confused, it seems. While melting ice caps (Greenland, Antarctica) and glaciers will lead to sea-level rise, I am unaware of the fact that it would lead to methane release. On the other hand, the “decomposition of frozen organic material” in, e.g., melting frozen soils of high latitudes (permafrost), could lead to carbon dioxide or methane release (depending on the hydrological conditions associated with this melting, i.e. aerobic or anaerobic).

 ",,,,"“Things are made worse by the loss of tropical forests which would otherwise help to mitigate climate change.”

","Tropical deforestation contributes to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases (see my above comment). Although regrowth and reforestation may partially offset these emissions, deforested areas will remain a long-term net source of greenhouse gases (1) unless complete regrowth is allowed.

Analysis of “9 questions on rising seas”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/cnn-john-sutter-9-questions-on-rising-seas/,9 questions on rising seas,https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/05/opinions/sutter-sea-level-climate/index.html,"CNN —  
You’ve probably heard about some of the impacts of rising seas: Nearly a fifth of Bangladesh, in South Asia, could be submerged; some low-lying islands in the Pacific may disappear; coastal cities like Miami and New York are expected to see more floods.

But exactly how and why are the seas rising?

The underlying answer, of course, is that humans are warming the planet by burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and engaging in other activities that release heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. Policy makers have concluded that the warming would be especially dangerous if it crosses a threshold of 2 degrees Celsius higher than Earth’s temperature at the start of the industrial revolution. But for details on how climate change is raising the height of the ocean, I turned to CNN International meteorologist and supervising weather producer Brandon Miller.

Below you’ll find an edited transcript of our email conversation.

I’ll be exploring sea-level rise and what happens to people whose homes are flooded this month as part of CNN’s “2 degrees” series on climate change. Let me know in the comments at the bottom of this post if there are other sea-level-related questions you’d like to see answered. And consider signing up for the “2 degrees” newsletter if you’d like to follow along.

1. Why are sea levels rising?
Global sea level rise occurs because of two factors. The biggest reason is because of something called “thermal expansion,” which is simply that water expands as it warms, just like how the liquid in a thermometer expands as the temperature increases. Therefore, as global temperatures continue to rise, the oceans get warmer and they literally expand, making the level of the sea rise. The other main contributor to sea level rise is the loss of glaciers and the polar ice caps. When the glaciers and ice caps melt, that water flows into the ocean and increases its volume.

2. Is this already happening – or is it a future thing?
Yes it is already happening, and yes it will continue to happen in the future, with the rate of sea level rise likely increasing as well. Since 1900 we have seen seas rise, on average, about 20 cm (8 inches). While ocean levels varied over the past 2,000 years, they did so much more slowly. It would have taken several hundred years to change the ocean level by the amount we have witnessed over the past century, with a bulk of that increase coming in the last 25 years.

The rate of change in the past 20 years is about double the rate of change over the past 100 years, indicating that the rate of sea level rise is increasing.

3. What will happen to sea levels if the climate warms 2 degrees?
Sea levels will certainly continue to rise if the climate warms 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). Sea level rise will not stop, even if the warming ends at 2 degrees. Instead, it will continue for many centuries due to the lag in response times of the world’s oceans and massive ice sheets.

If we look at the distant past, 120,000 years ago, when only very early humans existed, the temperature was 2 degrees warmer than it is now. Sea levels were about 5 meters (16 feet) higher than they are today. Nearly 500 million people worldwide currently live below 5 meters elevation.

4. How much are sea levels expected to rise by, say, 2100?
According to the latest projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a 2 degree increase in temperature by the end of this century would result in about a half a meter (1.5 feet) of sea level rise. If we drastically and immediately reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses we are currently emitting, the sea level will still continue to rise as the result of the warming we have already seen, but it should be less, likely around 40 cm (15 inches). If we continue increasing greenhouse gas emissions at the current rate, the increase in sea level could be up to double that amount, or 80 cm (31 inches) by 2100.

5. What about in the really, really long term?
One of the big questions is how much warming will it take to melt the Greenland Ice Sheet, which contains enough water to raise sea levels by 7 meters (23 feet). This is an incredibly difficult question to answer, but current research shows it is likely between 1 degree and 4 degrees warming, compared to pre-industrial averages. If 2 degrees is enough to melt the Greenland Ice Sheet, for instance, it could mean sea levels would rise much higher and faster than current projections show. A total melting of Greenland’s ice likely would take thousands of years, though.

6. Are lots of the Pacific islands actually going to disappear?
Likely not disappear, at least not in the short term (through the end of this century), but they will be dramatically impacted. Many low-lying regions will see drastic changes to their coastal geography from beach erosion, significant infrastructure challenges from things like saltwater intrusion into the water system, and population displacement from inundation. There are some extreme examples, such as the Marshall Islands, where 99% of the country lies below 5 meters in elevation, which could literally be “wiped off the map,” but the problem is far more wide-reaching than a few tiny Pacific islands. Coastal communities around the world will face higher risks for storm-induced tidal surges, frequent inundation from high tides, etc. Many of the world’s largest and most influential cities are located on the coast and must make significant preparations to combat rising sea levels.

7. What about Bangladesh? Isn’t it very high risk?
Yes, absolutely. Bangladesh is in a very precarious situation in that it is vulnerable to flooding from all sides as a result of climate change. Increasing sea levels will continuously shrink the low-level coastal communities, while the major rivers that flow through Bangladesh (Ganges and Brahmaputra) will face increasing water levels from melting glaciers in the Himalayas. Bangladesh has the eighth largest population of any country – at 158 million – and a majority of these people live in the areas where these rising rivers meet a rising sea.

8. What’s happening to U.S. cities – like New York, NOLA and Miami?
The World Bank recently led a study that ranked cities around the globe in terms of their risk of coastal flooding resulting from climate change. When looking at overall costs of damage, five of the top 10 cities were in the United States: Miami (2), New York (3), New Orleans (4), Tampa (7), Boston (8). This is largely due to the massive amounts of infrastructure, economic assets and population that are located directly on the coast and at low elevation.

Based on the 2014 U.S. National Climate Assessment, New York City would see a local sea level rise of nearly 4 feet by 2100. A 4-foot sea level rise for New York would result in nearly 100,000 people being underwater in New York City alone, with a property value of $16.5 billion.

9. How many people will be displaced by rising seas?
In a 2-degree world, hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding as a result of climate change. Asia, namely East, Southeast, and South Asia will be particularly affected. Unfortunately, some of these regions which will face the largest and most immediate impacts from rising seas have the fewest resources to combat them. In many cases, the cost of coastal adaptation may be too much, flooding from storms pushing higher water levels into homes will become too frequent, or the intrusion of saltwater into the local water table will make growing crops impossible – and people in all regions of the world will be forced to leave their homes and cities.",high,"Insightful, Unbiased",1,"The article succeeds in conveying the main causes, aspects and impacts of rising sea levels. While it does contain a few incomplete scientific statements and facts that ought to be explored and expanded upon in more depth, the article accurately conveys the general scientific realities of the issue.

","The present article requires correction because some facts are missing or misleading. I find the link between the 2-degree world and sea level rise weak. It is not clear what sea level rise will be avoided by limiting warming to 2 degrees. Personally, I am not satisfied with a +2 deg world because ice sheet melt won’t stop with that. I would rather support a return to conditions prevailing in the earlier part of the 20th century. Yes, that means we have to find ways to suck the CO2 back in, not just limit our emissions. What an exciting challenge!

Analysis of “Vanuatu’s president makes a leap in tying Cyclone Pam to climate change”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/mashable-andrew-freedman-vanuatu-cyclone-pam-climate-change/,Vanuatu’s president makes a leap in tying Cyclone Pam to climate change,https://mashable.com/archive/vanuatu-cyclone-pam-global-warming,"After Category 5 Cyclone Pam tore his country apart, prompting a humanitarian emergency, Vanuatu's President Baldwin Lonsdale pinned at least part of the blame for the islands' predicament on manmade global warming. The storm, which struck with a ferocity the country had not experienced before in modern history, had sustained winds of 165 miles per hour, with gusts exceeding 200 miles per hour when it roared through the tiny country. It leveled homes and businesses, and stripped trees bare on the most populated island of Efate, including the capital of Port Vila. The death toll stood at 24 on Tuesday, but it is expected to rise as more information begins streaming in from outlying islands that have been cut off from the outside world. [seealso url=""http://mashable.com/2014/09/29/global-warming-making-heat-waves-some-droughts-more-common-studies-find/""] “This is a very devastating cyclone … I term it a monster that has hit Vanuatu,” Lonsdale said at a U.N. disaster summit in Japan, according to The Guardian. “It is a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu. … All the development that has taken place has been wiped out.” He said the cyclone seasons that the nation had experienced were the result of climate change. “We see the level of sea rise … the cyclone seasons, the warm, the rain, all this is affected,” he said. So, is the president correct to link the devastating cyclone to global warming? Or is the tie so tenuous that it's almost nonexistent? The answer, as it often is in climate science, is far more nuanced than Vanuatu's president portrays it. Scientists say unusually mild sea surface temperatures and added atmospheric water vapor helped the storm intensify before slamming into Vanuatu. At the same time, rising sea levels likely made the storm more damaging than it would have been just a few decades ago. Here are the main factors to consider when analyzing the potential ties between Cyclone Pam and the warming climate.
Ocean temperatures are the main suspect
Scientists Mashable contacted said the storm intensified rapidly before hitting Vanuatu, aided by an area of unusually mild ocean waters and favorable atmospheric conditions. Ocean temperatures in the area where the cyclone intensified were up to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Some -- but not all -- of the sea surface temperature anomalies in the Southwest Pacific Ocean are likely related to global warming, according to Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, as well as other experts.

According to Trenberth, about about 0.6 degrees Celsius, or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit, of the ocean temperature anomalies ""can be blamed on human-induced global warming"" while the rest is ""natural"" and associated with an ongoing El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Niño is a climate phenomenon that features warmer than average ocean temperatures in much of the tropical Pacific Ocean. It can alter worldwide weather patterns, including tropical cyclone seasons in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Whatever the cause, though, the warm ocean waters can supercharge storms like Cyclone Pam, as more evaporation takes place and moisture is added to the air. ""The atmosphere all around there has some 10 to 20% more moisture in it than a comparable storm in the 1970s would have had. The high sea surface temperatures and the water vapor fueled the storm and undoubtedly increased its intensity and size,"" Trenberth said in an email conversation. ""The winds are stronger, the storm surge is greater on higher sea levels."" El Niño ""has played a role here on top of global warming. But strong storms can certainly occur in that region anyway (but not this strong). The sea surface temperatures are over 86 degrees Fahrenheit for heaven's sake,"" he said. An analysis of long-term trends in sea surface temperatures in the region where Cyclone Pam rapidly intensified into a Category 5 monster shows that there has been a warming trend since 1948, although there are considerable uncertainties in this data, says Michael Ventrice, an operational meteorologist at WSI Corporation in Massachusetts. He said it is not clear from the data whether the higher temperatures were a result of natural variations or human effects.

""The bottom line point is that there has been a long-term warming trend observed in the location where Pam intensified,"" Ventrice said.
Madden and Julian...
Ventrice says Cyclone Pam ""thrived"" in an environment that was well-suited to explosive intensification. These environmental factors included the warm ocean waters that extended deep into the ocean, as well as a natural weather cycle known as the Madden Julian Oscillation, or MJO. In certain instances, the MJO can encourage the air to rise, forming thunderstorms as well as tropical cyclones. Think of the MJO as a helping hand that likely aided the storm's rapid intensification. ""The MJO acts to moisten the middle and upper-levels of the atmosphere and reduce vertical wind shear, both are which parameters that are musts for intensification,"" Ventrice said.

Few robust trends in tropical cyclones near Vanuatu
Climate research has shown that tropical cyclones in many ocean basins are becoming stronger and lasting longer than they used to. However, the Southwest Pacific, where Cyclone Pam occurred, is not one of these areas, possibly due to the relative paucity of data there. Kerry Emanuel, a meteorologist at MIT who is a prominent researcher examining global warming-related trends in tropical storms and hurricanes, told Mashable that not much can be said about trends in the vicinity of Vanuatu.

""Ironically, this is a part of the world where we do not observe any significant upward trends in tropical cyclone metrics, and few models predict upward trends there as a consequence of global warming,"" he said in an email. In a post for the blog Realclimate on March 18, Emanuel wrote that there are signs that some parameters of severe tropical cyclones are changing, even in areas like the Southwest Pacific basin where data is relatively sparse. ""While Pam and Haiyan, as well as other recent tropical cyclone disasters, cannot be uniquely pinned on global warming, they have no doubt been influenced by natural and anthropogenic climate change and they do remind us of our continuing vulnerability to such storms,"" Emanuel said. Tom Knutson, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that of the six ocean basins that give rise to tropical cyclones, the Southwest Pacific basin is an area that shows the least tendency for an increase in storm activity by the end of the century. In fact, there may be a decrease in cyclone frequency or intensity there, based on the most recent computer model simulations, Knutson says. James Elsner, a professor at Florida State University who has been investigating how global warming may be altering the strongest storms on Earth, says he would be surprised if South Pacific storms were not growing stronger, like storms elsewhere. But the data is not yet there to prove it. ""We have a pretty solid basis (physical & empirical) for our understanding that ocean heat makes the strongest tropical cyclones stronger,"" he said. ""Empirically it has been shown for the global as a whole and for the North Atlantic. But the signal is hard to see in noisy data, and especially where confounded by a trend toward fewer cyclones."" Although global warming signals may not be present yet, multiple studies have shown that manmade global warming is likely to cause tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons) to be more intense, on average, than they are today, which means these storms will be more destructive. Manmade warming is also likely to lead to an uptick in the number of extremely intense tropical cyclones in some ocean basins during the next several decades, according to peer reviewed research. Since sea-level rise is already making cyclones more destructive by giving them a higher launching pad for storm surge flooding, this means that future storms may be an order of magnitude more damaging than what we typically experience today. As a small, low-lying island nation, Vanuatu is acutely aware of rising sea levels due to global warming. Along with other small island countries, some of which were affected by the same cyclone, Vanuatu has lobbied the U.N. in favor of steep greenhouse gas emissions cuts to reduce the severity of climate change, seeing it as a matter of its very survival as a nation. [wp_scm_comment]","high, very_high",Insightful,1,"The main reason for the positive evaluation is that the author successfully places Cyclone Pam within the larger context of climate change and its’ effect on tropical cyclones, and does so by effectively calling on several scientists with expertise in this field.

","All of the scientists quoted in that article are reputable, well-respected experts on the subject. The extent to which there’s a diversity of expert opinions expressed in that article concerning the connection between Pam and anthropogenic global warming accurately reflects the degree of scientific uncertainty on the matter and the various ways in which climate change can influence tropical cyclones. For example, sea level has undoubtedly risen due to anthropogenic activities and this certainly increases the storm surge. Likewise, higher moisture contents in the atmosphere lead to higher rainfall amounts in tropical cyclones. The impact of anthropogenic climate change on TC intensity is less clear, and this is reflected in the comments of those quoted.

","A growing body of published evidence is pointing towards there being substantially more intense tropical cyclones as a result of climate change. And this is not just in the future. Recent studies by us have indicated a substantial increase in the proportion of Category 4 and 5 cyclones both globally and in individual regions that is strongly related to the global surface temperature increases that have already occurred. For the western South Pacific the proportion of Cat 4-5 cyclones has more than doubled in the last 30 years[1]. Thus, the chances of a Pam occurring have increased substantially because of climate change.

",,,"Jim Kossin, Research Scientist, NOAA's Center for Weather and Climate
","An insightful and timely article. There are some statements quoted that are not easily supported and may be overstating the direct impacts of climate change on Cyclone Pam, but the overall message is reasonable.

","Dan Chavas, Assistant Professor, Purdue University
","Overall it’s a nice, well-written article that hits most of the key points regarding the complex question of how global warming may affect tropical cyclones. The main issue is with the comments quoted from one of the “experts”, Kevin Trenberth, that are misleading.

","Emmanuel M Vincent, Research Scientist, University of California, Merced: Emmanuel Vincent, Research Scientist, Editor, Science Feedback
","Even though one may ask whether a single storm is caused by or linked to climate change, this is not a question that science can confidently answer (Vice News has an insightful article on this). What can be more confidently stated is that the impacts associated with Tropical Cyclones (notably coastal surge and floods from cyclonic rainfall) are very likely increasing due to anthropogenic climate change.

","Hamish Ramsay, Lecturer, Monash University
","The interannual (El Niño) and intraseasonal (Madden-Julian Oscillation) variability present in the South Pacific at the time of Pam likely contributed to its extreme intensity. It is important that we understand the influence of these internal modes on tropical cyclone intensity within the broader context of a long-term warming trend in the Pacific.

Analysis of “The Alarming Thing About Climate Alarmism”,https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-bjorn-lomborg-alarming-thing-climate-alarmism/,The Alarming Thing About Climate Alarmism,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bjorn-lomborg-the-alarming-thing-about-climate-alarmism-1422832462#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20climate%20change%20is,reality%20or%20not%20a%20problem.&text=But%20the%20narrative%20that%20the,from%20focusing%20on%20smart%20solutions.","It is an indisputable fact that carbon emissions are rising—and faster than most scientists predicted. But many climate-change alarmists seem to claim that all climate change is worse than expected. This ignores that much of the data are actually encouraging. The latest study from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that in the previous 15 years temperatures had risen 0.09 degrees Fahrenheit. The average of all models expected 0.8 degrees. So we’re seeing about 90% less temperature rise than expected.

Facts like this are important because a one-sided focus on worst-case stories is a poor foundation for sound policies. Yes, Arctic sea ice is melting faster than the models expected. But models also predicted that Antarctic sea ice would decrease, yet it is increasing. Yes, sea levels are rising, but the rise is not accelerating—if anything, two recent papers, one by Chinese scientists published in the January 2014 issue of Global and Planetary Change, and the other by U.S. scientists published in the May 2013 issue of Coastal Engineering, have shown a small decline in the rate of sea-level increase.

We are often being told that we’re seeing more and more droughts, but a study published last March in the journal Nature actually shows a decrease in the world’s surface that has been afflicted by droughts since 1982.

Hurricanes are likewise used as an example of the “ever worse” trope. If we look at the U.S., where we have the best statistics, damage costs from hurricanes are increasing—but only because there are more people, with more-expensive property, living near coastlines. If we adjust for population and wealth, hurricane damage during the period 1900-2013 decreased slightly.

At the U.N. climate conference in Lima, Peru, in December, attendees were told that their countries should cut carbon emissions to avoid future damage from storms like typhoon Hagupit, which hit the Philippines during the conference, killing at least 21 people and forcing more than a million into shelters. Yet the trend for landfalling typhoons around the Philippines has actually declined since 1950, according to a study published in 2012 by the American Meteorological Society’s Journal of Climate. Again, we’re told that things are worse than ever, but the facts don’t support this.","very_low, low","Cherry-picking, Flawed reasoning, Misleading",7,"The main reason for this negative evaluation is that the author practices cherry-picking: he is selecting limited evidence to support his thesis that “much of the data about climate change are…encouraging”. The evidence provided is insufficient: several examples are either inaccurate or only speak about one aspect of the problem, ignoring much of the published literature on the subject.

","Bjorn Lomborg’s op-ed refers to the recent plateau in global mean temperature, but he ignores that the last fifteen years have been very warm; most of the warmest years on record occurred in the past 15. This is a very old argument, that “cherry-picks” data without providing historical context.
I am “not a climate scientist, but I know many very good scientists”, so I will not speak more to the science behind that.
I will, though, speak to the detected and attributed examples of the observed and anticipated increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and the message that Bjorn sends for those whose job is to protect people and natural systems.
These events are the fingerprints of the manifestation of a changing climate that has been reported for decades. It is possible to pick one, like droughts, where attribution is difficult because we have so little data. Or others, like hurricanes, where alternative explanations need some more work.
It is, though, irresponsible to ignore the preponderance of evidence on floods, extreme precipitation events (and if it is winter, these are snow storms), wildfires, etc. These were anticipated to occur as the climate changes. They have occurred around the world (U.S., Russia, Indonesia, Japan, Argentina, etc..), and they are getting worse and more frequent[2].
Bjorn does speak to impacts on humans with his natural disaster discussion, but he ignores the value of adaptations that communities have undertaken over the past decade or so to reduce risk –successful adaptations based on local social, political and economic context that allow people to survive. Ignoring these activities allows Bjorn to suggest that the climate problem is minimal. That is to say, the reductions in deaths that he reports can be attributed largely to reactions undertaken by communities and societies because they had recognized the “dark tails” of what the future might hold[3].
The message of this opinion piece, if believed, would eliminate the value of responses based on risk –and cost lives and billions of dollars in damage[4] that will then be attributed to a gross misinterpretation of the recent history.
Bjorn is a fan of cost-benefit analysis with high discount rates and a single metric, and it is from that perspective that he derives his repetition of the same message. The world has moved on, and the WSJ should know better. Their readers understand risk management; why do not the editors insist that their opinion writers do the same?

","The article contains numerous scientific errors, does not provide references for some of its key claims, and ignores much of the published literature on the subjects discussed. It appears that many details have been cherry-picked or misconstrued in service of making a political point.","Alexis Berg, Research Associate, Harvard University
","The author tries to rebut the narrative “that the world’s climate is changing from bad to worse”. In doing so, he erects a straw-man, cherry-picks studies and misrepresents current climate science. Furthermore, the logic that since things are not ‘worst-than-we-thought’, we shouldn’t take action and do the things we would do if things were simply ‘bad’, is lost on me…

","Emmanuel M Vincent, Research Scientist, University of California, Merced:","The article is imprecise, for instance, about who the “doomsayers” and the “alarmists” are: since the core of the argumentation is about them, a definition of who they are and what they argue exactly cannot be avoided. It is also vague in its conclusion: “we need balance”, here again what exactly is meant by balance should be made clearer.

","John Dwyer, Postdoctoral research fellow, MIT
","Tries and fails to make a convincing case for why humans need to worry about climate change less than they currently do.

","Britta Voss, Postdoctoral Research fellow, U.S. Geological Survey
","Although this author appears to have read parts of the IPCC report and carefully selected the facts which support his narrative, he presents information in a very misleading way, and some of his statements (e.g. “despite endless successions of climate summits, carbon emissions continue to rise”) do not support his thesis that action on climate change is alarmist and unnecessary. His conclusion that “climate change is not worse than we thought. Some indicators are worse, but some are better” suggests a false equivalency between the indicators that are “worse” and those that are “better”.

","Dan Chavas, Assistant Professor, Purdue University
","The author on multiple occasions presents blatantly inaccurate information and otherwise uses selective information to argue his point, which is highly misleading.

"Analysis of “2014 Breaks Heat Record, Challenging Global Warming Skeptics”",https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/new-york-times-justin-gillis-2014-breaks-heat-record/,"2014 Breaks Heat Record, Challenging Global Warming Skeptics","https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/science/earth/2014-was-hottest-year-on-record-surpassing-2010.html#:~:text=Christy%2C%20an%20atmospheric%20scientist%20at,error%20margin%20of%20global%20temperature","Last year was the hottest on earth since record-keeping began in 1880, scientists reported on Friday, underscoring warnings about the risks of runaway greenhouse gas emissions and undermining claims by climate change contrarians that global warming had somehow stopped.

Extreme heat blanketed Alaska and much of the western United States last year. Records were set across large areas of every inhabited continent. And the ocean surface was unusually warm virtually everywhere except near Antarctica, the scientists said, providing the energy that fueled damaging Pacific storms.

In the annals of climatology, 2014 surpassed 2010 as the warmest year. The 10 warmest years have all occurred since 1997, a reflection of the relentless planetary warming that scientists say is a consequence of human activity and poses profound long-term risks to civilization and nature.

“Climate change is perhaps the major challenge of our generation,” said Michael H. Freilich, director of earth sciences at NASA, one of the agencies that track global temperatures.

Of the large land areas where many people live, only the eastern portion of the United States recorded below-average temperatures in 2014, in sharp contrast to the unusual heat in the West. Some experts think the weather pattern that produced those American extremes is an indirect consequence of the release of greenhouse gases, though that is not proven.

Several scientists said the most remarkable thing about the 2014 record was that it had occurred in a year that did not feature a strong El Niño, a large-scale weather pattern in which the Pacific Ocean pumps an enormous amount of heat into the atmosphere.

Skeptics of climate change have long argued that global warming stopped around 1998, when an unusually powerful El Niño produced the hottest year of the 20th century. Some politicians in Washington have seized on that claim to justify inaction on emissions.

But the temperature of 1998 is now being surpassed every four or five years, and 2014 was the first time that happened without a significant El Niño. Gavin A. Schmidt, head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, said the next strong El Niño would probably rout all temperature records.

“Obviously, a single year, even if it is a record, cannot tell us much about climate trends,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, head of earth system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “However, the fact that the warmest years on record are 2014, 2010 and 2005 clearly indicates that global warming has not ‘stopped in 1998,’ as some like to falsely claim.”

Such claims are unlikely to go away, though. John R. Christy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is known for his skepticism about the seriousness of global warming, pointed out in an interview that 2014 had surpassed the other record-warm years by only a few hundredths of a degree, well within the error margin of global temperature measurements. “Since the end of the 20th century, the temperature hasn’t done much,” Dr. Christy said. “It’s on this kind of warmish plateau.”

Despite such arguments from a handful of scientists, the vast majority of those who study the climate say the earth is in a long-term warming trend that is profoundly threatening and caused almost entirely by human activity.

They expect the heat to get much worse over coming decades, but already it is killing forests around the world, driving plants and animals to extinction, melting land ice and causing the seas to rise at an accelerating pace.

“It is exceptionally unlikely that we would be witnessing a record year of warmth, during a record-warm decade, during a several decades-long period of warmth that appears to be unrivaled for more than a thousand years, were it not for the rising levels of planet-warming gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels,” Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at the Pennsylvania State University, said in an email.

NASA and the other American agency that maintains long-term temperature records, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, issued separate data compilations on Friday that confirmed the 2014 record. A Japanese agency had released preliminary information in early January showing 2014 as the warmest year.

One more scientific group, in Britain, that curates the world’s temperature record is scheduled to report in the coming weeks.

Separate temperature measurements taken from satellites do not show 2014 as a record year, although it is close. Several scientists said the satellite readings reflected temperatures in the atmosphere, not at the earth’s surface, so it was not surprising that they would differ slightly from the ground and ocean-surface measurements that showed record warmth.

“Why do we keep getting so many record-warm years?” Dr. Schmidt asked in an interview. “It’s because the planet is warming. The basic issue is the long-term trend, and it is not going away.”

February 1985 was the last time global surface temperatures fell below the 20th-century average for a given month, meaning that no one younger than 30 has ever lived through a below-average month. The last full year that was colder than the 20th-century average was 1976.

The contiguous United States set a temperature record in 2012, a year of scorching heat waves and drought. But, mostly because of the unusual chill in the East, 2014 was only the 34th warmest year on record for the lower 48 states.

That cold was drawn into the interior of the country by a loop in a current called the jet stream that allowed Arctic air to spill southward. But an offsetting kink allowed unusually warm tropical air to settle over the West, large parts of Alaska and much of the Arctic.

A few recent scientific papers say that such long-lasting kinks in the jet stream have become more likely because global warming is rapidly melting the sea ice in the Arctic, but many leading scientists are not convinced on that point.

Whatever the underlying cause, last year’s extreme warmth in the West meant that Alaska, Arizona, California and Nevada all set temperature records. Some parts of California essentially had no winter last year, with temperatures sometimes running 10 to 15 degrees above normal for the season. The temperature in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city, never fell below zero in 2014, the first time that has happened in 101 years of record-keeping for the city.

Twenty years of global negotiations aimed at slowing the growth of heat-trapping emissions have yielded little progress. However, 2014 saw signs of large-scale political mobilization on the issue, as more than 300,000 people marched in New York City in September, and tens of thousands more took to the streets in other cities around the world.

The next big attempt at a global climate agreement will come when negotiators from around the world gather in Paris in December. Political activists on climate change wasted no time Friday in citing the 2014 heat record as proof that strong action was needed.

“The steady and now record-breaking rise in average global temperatures is not an issue for another day,” Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who is spending tens of millions of dollars of his personal fortune to battle climate change, said in a statement. “It’s a clear and present danger that poses major economic, health, environmental and geopolitical risks.”","high, very_high","Accurate, Insightful, Sound reasoning",1,"This article covers the release of annual average global surface temperature estimates for 2014, which placed it as the warmest year on record. Justin Gillis’ article placed the 2014 temperature record in the context of both natural climate variability and the long-term trend of anthropogenic climate change. Gillis fairly described some ideas as still subject to debate in the scientific community, while identifying consensus ideas clearly.

","This article accurately describes global warming and puts the news that 2014 is the hottest year on record into appropriate context. The article does a very good job of distinguishing between climate variability and climate change with helpful discussion on ENSO and the relatively cold temperatures in the Eastern United States (while staying within the bounds of the mainstream climate science understanding).

","Kyle Armour, Assistant Professor, University of Washington
","Very good article overall. I do wish the author had fact checked the incorrect claim by Dr. Christy (that global temperatures have not changed since the end of the 20th century) prior to including his quote in the article.

","Andreas Klocker, Physical Oceanographer, University of Tasmania","Scientifically this article seems to be correct but it could be a bit more precise in some of its statements. One thing I like is that it mentions different opinions on some points where scientists do not agree rather than giving a biased story.

","Britta Voss, Postdoctoral Research fellow, U.S. Geological Survey
","This article does a good job of putting the 2014 temperature record in context with quotes from experts and good descriptions of relevant issues such as El Nino. References to “skeptics” were appropriately followed up by evidence of their misinterpretation / mischaracterization of the data.

","Alice Alpert, PhD candidate, MIT - WHOI Joint Program
","This article provides an accurate and well supported evaluation of the finding that 2014 was the hottest year on record.
","Emmanuel M Vincent, Research Scientist, University of California, Merced
","Overall, this article is fair in its representation of the 2014 temperature record event and in reminding the context of the long-term warming trend+natural climate variability.

","Alexis Tantet, Postdoctoral researcher, Hamburg University, Meteorologisches Institut
","The quality of this article is overall higher than most newspaper articles on climate change as it avoids the usual pitfalls such as confusing year to year variability with long-term change. It also addresses issues prone to confusion, such as why eastern USA did not experience such a warm year as most of the globe, which can help the readers to put the science in perspective with the seasonal climate they have actually experienced.
