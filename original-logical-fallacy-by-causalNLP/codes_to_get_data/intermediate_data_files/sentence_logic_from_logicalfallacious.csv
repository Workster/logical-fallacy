0,https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Accent-Fallacy," In the movie, My Cousin Vinny, Ralph Maccio's character, Bill, was interrogated for suspected murder. When the police officer asks him, ""At what point did you shoot the clerk?"" Bill replies in shock, ""I shot the clerk? I shot the clerk?"" Later in the film, the police officer reads Bill's statement as a confession in court, ""...and he said, 'I shot the clerk. I shot the clerk.'""",Accent Fallacy," In the movie, it appeared that the police officer did understand Bill's question as a confession. So it did not appear to be a fallacious tactic of the police officer, rather a failure of critical thought perhaps due to a strong confirmation bias (the officer was very confident that Bill was guilty, thus failed to detect the nuance in the question).",,"Claim is made with accent on word X giving claim meaning Y.

1,https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Accent-Fallacy," In the hilarious Broadway musical, The Book of Mormon, there is a musical number where one character is explaining how to bury ""bad thoughts"" by just ""turning them off"" (like a light switch). The character doing the explaining (in glorious song) is specifically explaining to the main character how to suppress gay thoughts when the main character's ""bad thoughts"" have nothing to do with being gay. After the instructions, the main character tries to make this clear by affirming, ""I'm not having gay thoughts,"" to which the other characters respond ""Hurray! It worked!""",Accent Fallacy," The stress on the ""I'm"" was ignored and confused for ""Hey, I'm not having gay thoughts anymore!"" Although this was comedy it portrayed an argument.",,,,,

These kinds of extreme views are rarely built on reason."," Stating the general rule when a good argument can be made that the action in question is a violation of the rule, would not be considered fallacious.
The Bible says, “Thou shall not murder,” therefore, as a Christian, you better put that chainsaw down and untie that little kid.","X is a common and accepted rule.
Therefore, there are no exceptions to X."," When an attempt is made to apply a general rule to all situations when clearly there are exceptions to the rule.

Vici: You know, dreams are not accurate ways to predict the future; they are simply the result of random neurons firing.
Rick: The last time I checked, you are no neurologist or psychologist, so how sure are you that I am not seeing the future?
Vici: It’s possible you can be seeing the future, I guess.
",Ad Fidentia," Although Vici is trying to reason with his friend, Rick attempts to weaken Vici’s argument by making Vici more unsure of his position.  This is a fallacious tactic by Rick, and if Vici falls for it, fallacious reasoning on his part."," When one claims certainty for something where certainty is unknowable, it is your duty to point it out.","Person 1 claims that Y is true, but is person 1 really sure about that?

Joe: Of course not, how can I be?
Chris: Exactly! One point for me!
Joe: What?
",Ad Fidentia," This is a common fallacy among those who argue for the supernatural or anything else not falsifiable.  If Joe was not that reasonable of a thinker, then he might start to question the validity of his position, not based on any new counter evidence presented, but a direct attack on his self-confidence.  Fortunately for Joe, he holds no dogmatic beliefs and is perfectly aware of the difference between possibilities and probabilities (see also appeal to possibility).",,,,,

Edna: He has been seeing Rose for three months now.
Frieda: He is just seeing her to make me jealous.
Edna: They’re engaged.
Frieda: Well, that’s just his way of making sure I know about it.
",Ad Hoc Rescue," Besides being a bit deluded, poor Frieda refuses to accept the evidence that leads to a truth she is not ready to accept.  As a result, she creates an ad hoc reason in an attempt to rescue her initial claim."," Proposing possible solutions is perfectly acceptable when an argument is suggesting only a possible solution -- especially in a hypothetical situation. For example, “If there is no God, then life is meaningless.”  If there is no God who dictates meaning to our lives, perhaps we are truly free to find our own meaning.","Claim X is true because of evidence Y.
Evidence Y is demonstrated not to be acceptable evidence.
Therefore, it must be guess Z then, even though there is no evidence for guess Z."," Very often we desperately want to be right and hold on to certain beliefs, despite any evidence presented to the contrary.

Ad hominem attacks are usually made out of desperation when one cannot find a decent counter argument."," When the attack on the person is relevant to the argument, it is not a fallacy.  In our first example, if the issue being debated was the elimination of taxes only on Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, then pointing out her eating habits would be strong evidence of a conflict of interest.","Person 1 is claiming Y.

Will: I doubt it—you obviously just want to sell me that car.
",Ad Hominem (Circumstantial)," The fact that the salesman has a vested interest in selling Will the car does not mean that he is lying.  He may be, but this is not something you can conclude solely on his interests.  It is reasonable to assume that salespeople sell the products and services they do because they believe in them."," As the bias or conflict of interest becomes more relevant to the argument, usually signified by a lack of other evidence, the argument is seen as less of a fallacy and more as a legitimate motive.  For example, courtesy of Meat Loaf...","Person 1 is claiming Y.
Person 1 has a vested interest in Y being true.

12,https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Ad-Hominem-Guilt-by-Association,Delores is a big supporter for equal pay for equal work.  This is the same policy that all those extreme feminist groups support.  Extremists like Delores should not be taken seriously -- at least politically.,Ad Hominem (Guilt by Association)," Making the assumption that Delores is an extreme feminist simply because she supports a policy that virtually every man and woman also supports, is fallacious."," If one can demonstrate that the connection between the two characteristics that were inherited by association is causally linked, or the probability of taking on a characteristic would be high, then it would be valid. In example #1, if Delores supported the “all men should be castrated” position, we can call her an “extremist.” In example #2, if we used “murdered children” instead of “against religion,” the claim of being a “very bad man” would be justified. In example #3, if Jake appeared on the podcast titled “I am racist, and you should be too,” Callie’s claim of Jake being a racist would be justified.","Person 1 states that Y is true.

Frankie is against religion; therefore, Frankie also must be a very bad man.",Ad Hominem (Guilt by Association)," The fact that Pol Pot and Frankie share one particular view does not mean they are identical in other ways unrelated, specifically, being a very bad man.  Pol Pot was not a bad man because he was against religion, he was a bad man for his genocidal actions.",,,,,

Chris: Did he say something racist?
Callie: No, but the podcast host did an interview two years ago with a woman who said she supported an organization that had a history of racism back in the 1960s. Jake clearly supports racism!
",Ad Hominem (Guilt by Association)," In this case, Jake Tooten is the “source” who is viewed negatively (as a racist) because of his association with the organization referenced. Note that his “association” with this group says nothing about his beliefs, which makes this fallacious. It is even more fallacious due to 1) Jake being several steps removed from this organization and 2) the organization’s history of racism rather than the organization’s current position on racism.
Callie actually was right, but for the wrong reason. Jake runs a Nazi youth group.",,,,,

Hugh: You eat fat burgers all the time so that can’t be true.
",Ad Hominem (Tu quoque)," It doesn’t matter (to the truth claim of the argument at least) if Helga follows her own advice or not.  While it might appear that the reason she does not follow her own advice is that she doesn’t believe it’s true, it could also be that those fat burgers are just too damn irresistible."," If Jimbo insisted that his actions were in line with sexual morality, then it would be a very germane part of the argument.","Person 1 is claiming that Y is true, but person 1 is acting as if Y is not true.

Therefore, all people under the age of 66 are children.",Affirmative Conclusion from a Negative Premise," In this case, the conclusion is obviously counterfactual although both premises are true.  Why?  Because this is a categorical syllogism where we have one or more negative premises (i.e., “no people...” and “no senior citizens...”), and we are attempting to draw a positive (affirmative) conclusion (i.e., “all people...”). ", No exceptions as this is a formal fallacy.,Any form of categorical syllogism with an affirmative conclusion and at least one negative premise.," The conclusion of a standard form categorical syllogism is affirmative, but at least one of the premises is negative.

Remember, a fallacy is an error in reasoning. Dismissing the council of legitimate experts and authorities turns good skepticism into denialism. The appeal to authority is a fallacy in argumentation, but deferring to an authority is a reliable heuristic that we all use virtually every day on issues of relatively little importance. There is always a chance that any authority can be wrong, that’s why the critical thinker accepts facts provisionally. It is not at all unreasonable (or an error in reasoning) to accept information as provisionally true by credible authorities. Of course, the reasonableness is moderated by the claim being made (i.e., how extraordinary, how important) and the authority (how credible, how relevant to the claim).
The appeal to authority is more about claims that require evidence than about facts. For example, if your tour guide told you that Vatican City was founded February 11, 1929, and you accept that information as true, you are not committing a fallacy (because it is not in the context of argumentation) nor are you being unreasonable.","According to person 1, who is an expert on the issue of Y, Y is true.

Like most fallacies, we have the fallacious tactic by the one who shares an article, post, or meme on social media depicting a statistically rare event with the intent to manipulate public perception of the event as a common event. Someone who views an article, post, or meme on social media depicting a statistically rare event and believes it to be a common event, has been a victim of deceptive sharing and is using fallacious reasoning. It is also possible for those sharing content to be deceived, themselves.
There is a strong, implied argument with the share that the event is far more common than it actually is. If the content is shared with an explicit argument claiming that the event is more common than it really is, then there is no fallacy; it is a factual error.

I think it is hilarious, so I am including it here in its entirety.My friends, I had not intended to discuss this controversial subject at this particular time. However, I want you to know that I do not shun controversy. On the contrary, I will take a stand on any issue at any time, regardless of how fraught with controversy it might be. You have asked me how I feel about whiskey. All right, here is how I feel about whiskey:
If when you say whiskey you mean the devil’s brew, the poison scourge, the bloody monster, that defiles innocence, dethrones reason, destroys the home, creates misery and poverty, yea, literally takes the bread from the mouths of little children; if you mean the evil drink that topples the Christian man and woman from the pinnacle of righteous, gracious living into the bottomless pit of degradation, and despair, and shame and helplessness, and hopelessness, then certainly I am against it.
But, if when you say whiskey you mean the oil of conversation, the philosophic wine, the ale that is consumed when good fellows get together, that puts a song in their hearts and laughter on their lips, and the warm glow of contentment in their eyes; if you mean Christmas cheer; if you mean the stimulating drink that puts the spring in the old gentleman’s step on a frosty, crispy morning; if you mean the drink which enables a man to magnify his joy, and his happiness, and to forget, if only for a little while, life’s great tragedies, and heartaches, and sorrows; if you mean that drink, the sale of which pours into our treasuries untold millions of dollars, which are used to provide tender care for our little crippled children, our blind, our deaf, our dumb, our pitiful aged and infirm; to build highways and hospitals and schools, then certainly I am for it.
This is my stand. I will not retreat from it. I will not compromise.
",If-By-Whiskey," This is an amazing insight into the human mind and the area of rhetoric.  We can see how when both sides of the issue are presented through the same use of emotionally charged words and phrases, the argument is really vacuous and presents very little factual information, nor does it even take a stance on the issue."," If you are serving as a moderator and need to remain neutral, plus want to add a little “spice” in the debate, this might be a good technique.","If you mean X, then (one-sided, loaded-language rant supporting side A).
If you mean Y, then (one-sided, loaded-language rant supporting side B).", A response to a question that is contingent on the questioner’s opinions and makes use of words with strong connotations.  This fallacy appears to support both sides of an issue -- a tactic common in politics.,,
289,https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/If-By-Whiskey," Having evaluated literally thousands of positions on God by people all over the belief spectrum, I thought I would create my own, “If-by-God” version of the argument, showing how carefully placed rhetoric can blur the line between the most perfect being imaginable and the most horrible being imaginable.
The question is, if God does exist, should we love him and worship him?  My position is clear, and I am not embarrassed to let the world know exactly how I feel.  So here it goes.
If by God you mean the great dictator in the sky, the almighty smiter, the God who created us with imperfections then holds us responsible for the imperfections, the God who took away paradise and eternal life from us because the first man and woman committed a “wrong” against God before they were capable of knowing right from wrong, the God who commanded his chosen people to utterly destroy every man, woman, and child in dozens of cities, the God who hardened hearts, killed first-borns, demanded blood sacrifices, commanded man to brutally kill other humans for “crimes” such as “not honoring your parents”, the God who destroyed virtually all living creatures on the planet, the God who would demand that his own son be brutally murdered to pay a debt to him, the God who allows children to be born with birth defects, die young, and get cancer, the God who continues to destroy using floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters, the God who ignores the prayers of billions of his faithful followers, the God who allows a majority of his creation to suffer through unimaginable torture for all eternity in the fiery pits of Hell, then he is certainly not deserving of our love and worship.
But, if when you say God you mean the defender, the protector, creator of heaven and earth, the father of us all, the being of pure love, kindness, and everything good in the world, the God who led the Israelites from slavery to freedom, the one who looks after us all, the God who heals the sick in his son’s name, the God who gave us his perfect laws for our benefit, the God who loved us so much, that he sacrificed his only son so that we can be saved, the God who allows us to spend a blissful eternity with him and our loved ones, then certainly he is deserving of our love and worship.
This is my stand. I will not retreat from it. I will not compromise.Exception: If you are serving as a moderator and need to remain neutral, plus want to add a little “spice” in the debate, this might be a good technique.
Fun Fact: Reportedly, the example #1 speech took Sweat two and a half months to write.

345,https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Moving-the-Goalposts," Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.

Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

",Multiple Comparisons Fallacy," Because we did multiple tests, i.e., compared multiple groups, statistically we are likely to get results that fall within the acceptable margin of error.  These must be disregarded as anomalies or tested further, but not taken to be meaningful while ignoring the other results.", Only proper testing and accurate representation of the results would lead to non-fallacious conclusions.,," Claiming that unexpected trends that occur through random chance alone in a data set with a large number of variables are meaningful.
In inductive arguments, there is always a chance that the conclusion might be false, despite the truth of the premises. This is often referred to as “confidence level.” In any given study or poll, there is a confidence level of less than 100%. If a confidence level is 95%, then one out of 20 similar studies will have a false conclusion. If you make multiple comparisons (either in the same study or compare multiple studies), say 20 or more where there is a 95% confidence level, you are likely to get a false conclusion. This becomes a fallacy when that false conclusion is seen as significant rather than a statistical probability.

This is the opposite of the moralistic fallacy.
A more traditional use of the naturalistic fallacy is committed when one attempts to define “good” as anything other than itself. The philosopher G. E. Moore (1873-1958) argued that it is a mistake to try to define the concept “good” in terms of some natural property (thus, the name “naturalistic”). Defining the concept “good,” Moore argued, is impossible since it is a simple concept; a concept that cannot be defined in terms of any other concept. Not all philosophers agree that this is a fallacy. Some have argued that ethical terms, such as “good” can be defined in nonethical natural terms.

356,https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/No-True-Scotsman," In 2011, Christian broadcaster, Harold Camping, (once again) predicted the end of the world via Jesus, and managed to get many Christians to join his alarmist campaign.

On a personal note, I think Camping was and is as much of a Christian as any other self-proclaimed Christian and religious/political/ethical beliefs aside, I give him credit for having the cojones to make a falsifiable claim about his religious beliefs.Example #2:

The universal claim here is that no UbaTuba White Men's Club member will ever (universal) go to jail.  Marvin points out how clearly this is counterfactual as there are many UbaTuba White Men's Club members in jail.  Instead of conceding or meaningfully revising the claim, the implication that no ""UbaTuba White Men's Club members"" is changed to “no true UbaTuba White Men's Club members”, which is not meaningful because John’s definition of a “true UbaTuba White Men's Club member” apparently can only be demonstrated in the negative if an UbaTuba White Men's Club member goes to jail.

The number of people involved in fatal accidents is roughly double that amount, meaning that about half of the people survive, and half die. Let's say that 80% of people involved in a fatal accident reach out for supernatural help. Given an even distribution among survivors and non survivors this would mean that 25,600 people who reach out for supernatural help die and 25,600 who reach out for supernatural help live to tell about it. Now we need to add in the 20% of survivors who did not reach out for supernatural help that lived: 6,400.

But they tell you not to take their word for it, let them prove it you by picking a stock a day for 7 days in a row that increases in value. Then, they say when you are convinced, call them and invest with them. Here's how the scam works:
Day 1: Five different stocks are chosen, and each stock is sent to 2 million people as the winning pick. Let's say three of those stocks make money, and two don't. The 4 million people who received the stock pick that lost money are removed from the list (kind of like dying).

Day 2: Another 5 stocks are chosen. This time, each stock is only sent to the ""survivors,"" about 1.2 million people each get a new pick. Out of that group, perhaps just two stocks are winners. That means that 2.4 million people got the winning stock
Day 7: After the final day of sending, about 100,000 ""survivors"" remain on the list. These are people who have been sent the winning picks 7 days in a row and are convinced that the ""investor"" must be legitimate. After all, what are the chances that anyone would pick 7 winning stocks in a row with that much confidence?
Tip: Whether someone is selling you investment services or a religion, think about the survivorship bias and how you might be jumping to an inaccurate conclusion.
