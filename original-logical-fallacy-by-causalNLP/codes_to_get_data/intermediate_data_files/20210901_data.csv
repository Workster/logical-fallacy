Recently, studies show that kids are stressed out when they come home from school and have loads of homework. Between after school sports, activities, and family time, students are finding less and less time to complete homework. Every parent wants to see their child succeed when it comes to school, so why not help your child out? As long as you aren’t giving too much assistance, helping with homework can be a good thing. Set up a homework time every night with your child, provide support, and monitor his or her work. It’s important that your child knows they can count on you they are stuck."

Expensive. Obesity. Addictive.Three words that show that video games can be bad for you. Sometimes video games can cost $40-$50 a piece! That’s a lot of money when you think of how many video games you own. Video games can be addicting, leaving little time to spend with family and friends…and little time to go outside and get some exercise. Which leads to obesity. If people are choosing to stay indoors to play video games, they are not getting outdoors and participating in outside activities. We must put an end to the amount of time spent on gaming!"
1205,https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/60075c7019b947001bd616b3/logical-fallacies,Logical Fallacies,8th grade,to inform readers about different kinds of waves,"Q. A wave is any movement that carries energy. Some waves carry energy through water. Others carry energy through gases, like air, or solid materials. If you drop a rock into a pool of water, a wave, or ripple of energy, skims across the pool's surface. In the same way, an underwater earthquake can release energy into ocean water. Then it carries a giant wave, or tsunami, across the surface until it hits land. If you hear a clap of thunder, sound waves (or vibrations) have carried the crashing BOOM to your ears. Sound waves speed through the air at about 1,100 feet (335 meters) per second. Light also travels through the air in waves. They travel at more than 186,000 miles (300 million meters) per second. So the light waves from a flash of lightning reach your eyes before that clap of thunder reaches your ears! Electrons travel in waves, too. They move back and forth in a solid wire, sending waves of electricity so you can turn on a light during the storm!

She refused to give up her seat on a bus, which led to a boycott of the bus system. She earned many honors for her work in the civil rights movement","Q. Rosa Parks has been called the ""mother of the civil rights movement."" She is one of the most important people of the 20th century. In December of 1955, she refused to give up her seat on a city bus to a white passenger. The bus driver had her arrested. She was sent to court. She was found guilty of breaking the law.
Her act sparked a boycott of the bus system by blacks. Blacks refused to use the buses for more than a year. The boycott introduced the country to a man named Martin Luther King, Jr. People all over the country came to know King. Soon, the U.S. Supreme Court made segregation on city buses against the law.
Over the next forty years, Rosa Parks helped make Americans aware of the history of the civil rights struggle. She earned many honors, including the Martin Luther King Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize. She is an example of courage and strength. She inspires all Americans to live free.

RONALD REAGAN: Yes. I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy. And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up, which has been going forward at a rapid pace, and for quite some time.
