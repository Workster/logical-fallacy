Therefore, to reduce crime, we must eliminate the laws.","The mere fact that more crime followed the creation of more laws does not entail that the new laws caused more crime.

Then, they say when you are convinced, call them and invest with them. Here's how the scam works:

Day 1: Five different stocks are chosen, and each stock is sent to 2 million people as the winning pick. Let's say three of those stocks make money, and two don't. The 4 million people who received the stock pick that lost money are removed from the list (kind of like dying).

Day 2: Another 5 stocks are chosen. This time, each stock is only sent to the ""survivors,"" about 1.2 million people each get a new pick. Out of that group, perhaps just two stocks are winners.
