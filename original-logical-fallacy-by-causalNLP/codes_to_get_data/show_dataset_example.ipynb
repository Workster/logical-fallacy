On Tuesday , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) is set to classify the Louisiana disaster as the eighth flood considered to be a once - in - every-500 - years event to have taken place in the US in little over 12 months . Since May of last year , dozens of people have been killed and thousands of homes have been swamped with water in extreme events in Oklahoma , Texas , South Carolina , West Virginia and Maryland . Noaa considers these floods extreme because , based on historical rainfall records , they should be expected to occur only once every 500 years . The Louisiana flooding has been so exceptional that some places in the state experienced storm conditions considered once - every-1,000 - year events . Close to 2 ft of rain fell over a 48 - hour period in parts of southern Louisiana , causing residents to scramble to safety from flooded homes and cars . At least six people have died , with another 20,000 people having to be rescued . Even Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards had to evacuate after his governor ’s mansion in Baton Rouge was swamped with chest - high water . A federal state of emergency has been declared , with 12,000 people crowding into shelters . The National Weather Service balloon released in New Orleans on Friday showed near - record levels of atmospheric moisture , prompting the service to state : “ We are in record territory . ” Climate scientists have warned that the build - up of moisture in the atmosphere , driven by warming temperatures , is likely to cause a greater number of floods in the future . “ We have been on an upward trend in terms of heavy rainfall events over the past two decades , which is likely related to the amount of water vapor going up in the atmosphere , ” said Dr Kenneth Kunkel , of the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites . “ There ’s a very tight loop – as surface temperatures of the oceans warm up , the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere . We ’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods . ” The number of heavy rainfall events in the US has risen well above the long - term average since the 1990s , with large regional variances . While the north - east , midwest and upper great plains have experienced a 30 % increase in heavy rainfall episodes – considered once - in - every - five year downpours – parts of the west , particularly California , have been parched by drought . Warmer air , influenced by heat - trapping gases released by human activity , can contain more water vapor than cooler air . With the extra heat helping nourish storms , scientists expect global warming to help produce more intense downpours . “ Assuming we do n’t change our ways , warming is a virtual certainty and increased water vapor is virtual certainty , ” Kunkel said . “ That means increases in heavy rainfall is virtual certainty . ” While scientists are loathe to attribute any single event to changes in the climate , they state that warming temperatures are helping tip the scales towards altered precipitation . Some , however , bristle at the belief that because floods and storms have always occurred , they should not be linked to climate change . Dr Kevin Trenberth , senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , said the major floods seen in the US had a “ clear human component in them . I have seen only a few reports and none mention climate change at all . It is pathetic . ” There are plenty of influences on rainfall levels , including natural variation and topography . One of the biggest variables will be how much warmer the world will become – Trenberth said each 1C increase in temperature can add 7 % more moisture in the atmosphere . But plotting exact projections between warming and the magnitude of downpours is something scientists are still working on . “ Changes in the global water cycle in response to the warming over the 21st century will not be uniform , ” states the latest IPCC assessment . “ The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase , although there may be regional exceptions . ” With the US suffering more weather - related disasters than any other country , an increase in rainfall , storm and hurricane intensity is something that could start demanding more attention from lawmakers . “ It ’s prudent to consider that if you ’re building something with a 100 - year lifetime , it ’s virtually certain that it will experience an increase in extreme rainfall , ” Kunkel said . “ We either pay now or pay later . If we build resiliency into infrastructure , we can protect life and property .</td>\n","      <td>['Sound_reasoning']</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["

Noaa considers these floods extreme because , based on historical rainfall records , they should be expected to occur only once every 500 years . The Louisiana flooding has been so exceptional that some places in the state experienced storm conditions considered once - every-1,000 - year events . Close to 2 ft of rain fell over a 48 - hour period in parts of southern Louisiana , causing residents to scramble to safety from flooded homes and cars . At least six people have died , with another 20,000 people having to be rescued . Even Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards had to evacuate after his governor ’s mansion in Baton Rouge was swamped with chest - high water . A federal state of emergency has been declared , with 12,000 people crowding into shelters . The National Weather Service balloon released in New Orleans on Friday showed near - record levels of atmospheric moisture , prompting the service to state : “ We are in record territory . ” Climate scientists have warned that the build - up of moisture in the atmosphere , driven by warming temperatures , is likely to cause a greater number of floods in the future . “ We have been on an upward trend in terms of heavy rainfall events over the past two decades , which is likely related to the amount of water vapor going up in the atmosphere , ” said Dr Kenneth Kunkel , of the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites . “ There ’s a very tight loop – as surface temperatures of the oceans warm up , the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere . We ’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods . ” The number of heavy rainfall events in the US has risen well above the long - term average since the 1990s , with large regional variances . While the north - east , midwest and upper great plains have experienced a 30 % increase in heavy rainfall episodes – considered once - in - every - five year downpours – parts of the west , particularly California , have been parched by drought . Warmer air , influenced by heat - trapping gases released by human activity , can contain more water vapor than cooler air . With the extra heat helping nourish storms , scientists expect global warming to help produce more intense downpours . “ Assuming we do n’t change our ways , warming is a virtual certainty and increased water vapor is virtual certainty , ” Kunkel said . “ That means increases in heavy rainfall is virtual certainty . ” While scientists are loathe to attribute any single event to changes in the climate , they state that warming temperatures are helping tip the scales towards altered precipitation . Some , however , bristle at the belief that because floods and storms have always occurred , they should not be linked to climate change . Dr Kevin Trenberth , senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , said the major floods seen in the US had a “ clear human component in them . I have seen only a few reports and none mention climate change at all . It is pathetic . ” There are plenty of influences on rainfall levels , including natural variation and topography . One of the biggest variables will be how much warmer the world will become – Trenberth said each 1C increase in temperature can add 7 % more moisture in the atmosphere . But plotting exact projections between warming and the magnitude of downpours is something scientists are still working on . “ Changes in the global water cycle in response to the warming over the 21st century will not be uniform , ” states the latest IPCC assessment . “ The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase , although there may be regional exceptions . ” With the US suffering more weather - related disasters than any other country , an increase in rainfall , storm and hurricane intensity is something that could start demanding more attention from lawmakers . “ It ’s prudent to consider that if you ’re building something with a 100 - year lifetime , it ’s virtually certain that it will experience an increase in extreme rainfall , ” Kunkel said . “ We either pay now or pay later . If we build resiliency into infrastructure , we can protect life and property .   \n","\n","     logical_fallacies  \n","0  ['Sound_reasoning']  "]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":28}]}]}
